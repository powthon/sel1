now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hourdraws on apace four happy days bring inanother moon but O methinks how slowthis old moon wanes she lingers my desireslike to a step dame or a dowagerlong withering out a young mans revenuefour days will quickly steep themselves in nightfour nights will quickly dream away the timeand then the moon like to a silver bownew-bent in heaven shall behold the nightof our solemnities go Philostratestir up the Athenian youth to merrimentsawake the pert and nimble spirit of mirthturn melancholy forth to funeralsthe pale companion is not for our pompHippolyta I wood thee with my swordand won thy love doing thee injuriesbut I will wed thee in another keywith pomp with triumph and with revellinghappy be Theseus our renowned dukethanks good Egeus whats the news with theefull of vexation come I with complaintagainst my child my daughter Hermiastand forth Demetrius my noble lordthis man hath my consent to marry herstand forth Lysander and my gracious dukethis man hath bewitched the bosom of my childthou Lysander thou hast given her rimesand interchanged love-tokens with my childthou hast by moonlight at her window sungwith feigning voice verses of feigning loveand stoln the impression of her fantasywith bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceitsknacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengersof strong prevailment in unhardened youthwith cunning thou hast filched my daughters heartturned her obedience which is due to meand my gracious duke to stubborn harshnessbe it so she will not here before your graceconsent to marry with DemetriusI beg the anent privilege of Athensas she is mine I may dispose of herwhich shall be either to this gentlemanor to her death according to our lawimmediately provided in that casewhat say you Hermia be advised fair maidto you your father should be as a godone that composed your beauties yea and oneto whom you are but as a form in waxby him imprinted and within his powerto leave the figure or disfigure itDemetrius is a worthy gentlemanso is Lysander in himself he isbut in this kind wanting your fathers voicethe other must be held the worthierI would my father looked but with my eyesrather your eyes must with his judgment lookI do entreat your grace to pardon meI know not by what power I am made boldnor how it may concern my modestyin such a presence here to plead my thoughtsbut I beseech your grace that I may knowthe worst that may befall me in this caseif I refuse to wed Demetriuseither to die the death or to abjurefor ever the society of mentherefore fair Hermia question your desiresknow of your youth examine well your bloodwhere if you yield not to your fathers choiceyou can endure the livery of a nunfor aye to be in shady cloister mewedto live a barren sister all your lifechanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moonthrice blessed they that master so their bloodto undergo such maiden pilgrimagebut earthlier happy is the rose distilledthan that which withering on the virgin thorngrows lives and dies in single blessednessso will I grow so live so die my lordere I will yield my virgin patent upunto his lordship whose unwished yokemy soul consents not to give sovereigntytake time to pause and by the next new moonthe sealing-day betwixt my love and mefor everlasting bond of fellowshipupon that day either prepare to diefor disobedience to your fathers willor else to wed Demetrius as he wouldor on Dianas altar to protestfor aye austerity and single liferelent sweet Hermia and Lysanderyield thy crazed title to my certain rightyou have her fathers love Demetriuslet me have Hermias do you marry himscornful Lysander true he hath my loveand what is mine my love shall render himand she is mine and all my right of herI do estate unto DemetriusI am my lord as well derived as heas well possessed my love is more than hismy fortunes every way as fairly rankedif not with vantage as Demetriusand which is more than all these boasts can beI am beloved of beauteous Hermiawhy should not I then prosecute my rightDemetrius iull avouch it to his headmade love to Nedars daughter Helenaand won her soul and she sweet lady dotesdevoutly dotes dotes in idolatryupon this spotted and inconstant manI must confess that I have heard so muchand with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereofbut being over-full of self-affairsmy mind did lose it but Demetrius comeand come Egeus you shall go with meI have some private schooling for you bothfor you fair Hermia look you arm yourselfto fit your fanes to your fathers willor else the law of Athens yields you upwhich by no means we may extenuateto death or to a vow of single lifecome my Hippolyta what cheer my loveDemetrius and Egeus go alongI must employ you in some businessagainst our nuptial and confer with youof something nearly that concerns yourselveswith duty and desire we follow youhow now my love why is your cheek so palehow chance the roses there do fade so fastbelike for want of rain which I could wellbeteem them from the tempest of mine eyesay me for aught that ever I could readcould ever hear by tale or historythe course of true love never did run smoothbut either it was different in bloodO cross too high to be enthralled to lowor else misgraffed in respect of yearsO spite too old to be engaged to youngor else it stood upon the choice of friendsO hell to choose love by anothers eyeor if there were a sympathy in choicewar death or sickness did lay siege to itmaking it momentany as a soundswift as a shadow short as any dreambrief as the lightning in the collied nightthat in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earthand ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it upso quick bright things come to confusionif then true lovers have been ever crossedit stands as an edict in destinythen let us teach our trial patiencebecause it is a customary crossas due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighswishes and tears poor fancys followersa good persuasion therefore hear me HermiaI have a widow aunt a dowagerof great revenue and she hath no childfrom Athens is her house remote seven leaguesand she respects me as her only sonthere gentle Hermia may I marry theeand to that place the sharp Athenian lawcannot pursue us if thou lovest me thensteal forth thy fathers house to-morrow nightand in the wood a league without the townwhere I did meet thee once with Helenato do observance to a morn of Maythere will I stay for thee my good LysanderI swear to thee by Cupids strongest bowby his best arrow with the golden headby the simplity of Venus dovesby that which knitteth souls and prospers lovesand by that fire which burned the Carthage queenwhen the false Troyan under sail was seenby all the vows that ever men have brokein number more than ever women spokein that same place thou hast appointed meto-morrow truly will I meet with theekeep promise love look here comes Helenagod speed fair Helena whither awaycall you me fair that fair again unsayDemetrius loves your fair O happy fairyour eyes are lode-stars and your tongues sweet airmore tuneable than lark to shepherds earwhen wheat is green when hawthorn buds appearsickness is catching O were favour soyours would I catch fair Hermia ere I gomy ear should catch your voice my eye your eyemy tongue should catch your tongues sweet melodywere the world mine Demetrius being batedthe rest id give to be to you translatedO teach me how you look and with what artyou sway the motion of Demetrius heartI frown upon him yet he loves me stillO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skillI give him curses yet he gives me loveO that my prayers could such affection movethe more I hate the more he follows methe more I love the more he hateth mehis folly Helena is no fault of minenone but your beauty would that fault were minetake comfort he no more shall see my facelysander and myself will fly this placebefore the time I did Lysander seeseemed Athens as a paradise to meO then what graces in my love do dwellthat he hath turned a heaven unto a hellhelen to you our minds we will unfoldto-morrow night when Phoebus be doth beholdher silver visage in the watry glassdecking with liquid pearl the bladed grassa time that lovers flights doth still concealthrough Athens gates have we devised to stealand in the wood where often you and Iupon faint primrose-beds were wont to lieemptying our bosoms of their counsel sweetthere my Lysander and myself shall meetand thence from Athens turn away our eyesto seek new friends and stranger companiesfarewell sweet playfellow pray thou for usand good luck grant thee thy Demetriuskeep word Lysander we must starve our sightfrom lovers food till morrow deep midnightI will my Hermia Helena adieuas you on him Demetrius dote on youhow happy some oer other some can bethrough Athens I am thought as fair as shebut what of that Demetrius thinks not sohe will not know what all but he do knowand as he errs doting on Hermias eyesso I admiring of his qualitiesthings base and vile holding no quantitylove can transpose to form and dignitylove looks not with the eyes but with the mindand therefore is winged Cupid painted blindnor hath loves mind of any judgment tastewings and no eyes figure unheedy hasteand therefore is love said to be a childbecause in choice he is so oft beguiledas waggish boys in game themselves forswearso the boy love is perjured every wherefor ere Demetrius looked on Hermias eynehe hailed down oaths that he was only mineand when this hail some heat from Hermia feltso he dissolved and showers of oaths did meltI will go tell him of fair Hermias flightthen to the wood will he to-morrow nightpursue her and for this intelligenceif I have thanks it is a dear expensebut herein mean I to enrich my painto have his sight thither and back againis all our company here you were best to call them generally man by man according to the scripthere is the scroll of every mans name which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at nightfirst good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a pointmarry our play is the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbya very good piece of work I assure you and a merry now good Peter Quince call forth your actors by the scroll masters spread yourselvesanswer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaverready name what part I am for and proceedyou Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramuswhat is Pyramus a lover or a tyranta lover that kills himself most gallantly for lovethat will ask some tears in the true performing of it if I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure to the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all splitthe raging rocksand shivering shocksshall break the locksof prison gatesand Phibbus carshall shine from farand make and marthe foolish fatesthis was lofty now name the rest of the players this is Ercles vein a tyrants vein a lover is more condolingfrans Flute the bellows-menderhere Peter Quinceyou must take Thisby on youwhat is Thisby a wandering knightit is the lady that Pyramus must lovenay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard comingthats all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you willan I may hide my face let me play Thisby too iull speak in a monstrous little voice Thisne Thisne ah Pyramus my lover dear thy Thisby dear and lady dear no no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisbywell proceedrobin Starveling the tailorhere Peter Quincerobin Starveling you must play Thisbys mother Tom snout the tinkerhere Peter Quinceyou Pyramuss father myself Thisbys father Snug the joiner you the lions part and I hope here is a play fittedhave you the lions part written pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of studyyou may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaringlet me play the lion too I will roar that I will do any mans heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the duke say let him roar again let him roar again an you should do it too terribly you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us allthat would hang us every mothers sonI grant you friends if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits they wou4ld have no more discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove I will roar you as itwere any nightingaleyou can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summers day a most lovely gentleman-like man therefore you must needs play Pyramuswell I will undertake it what beard were I best to play it inwhy what you willI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard your orange-tawny beard your purple-in-grain beard or your French-crown colour beard your perfect yellowsome of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play bare-faced but masters here are your parts and I am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by to-morrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if we meet in the ty we shall be dogged with company and our devices known in the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants I pray you fail me notwe will meet and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously take pains be perfect adieuat the dukes oak we meetenough hold or cut bow-stringshow now spirit whither wander youover hill over dalethorough bush thorough brierover park over palethorough flood thorough fireI do wander every whereswifter than the moones sphereand I serve the fairy queento dew her orbs upon the greenthe cowslips tall her pensioners bein their gold coats spots you seethose be rubies fairy favoursin their freckles live their savoursI must go seek some dew-drops hereand hang a pearl in every cowslips earfarewell thou lob of spirits iull be goneour queen and all her elves come here anonthe king doth keep his revels here to-nighttake heed the queen come not within his sightfor Oberon is passing fell and wrathbecause that she as her attendant hatha lovely boy stoln from an Indian kingshe never had so sweet a changelingand jealous Oberon would have the childknight of his train to trace the forests wildbut she perforce withholds the loved boycrowns him with flowers and makes him all her joyand now they never meet in grove or greenby fountain clear or spangled starlight sheenbut they do square that all their elves for fearcreep into acorn-cups and hide them thereeither I mistake your shape and making quiteor else you are that shrewd and knavish spritecalled Robin Goodfellow are you not hethat frights the maidens of the villageryskim milk and sometimes labour in the quernand bootless make the breathless housewife churnand sometime make the drink to bear no barmmislead night-wanderers laughing at their harmthose that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puckyou do their work and they shall have good luckare you not hefairy thou speakest arightI am that merry wanderer of the nightI jest to Oberon and make him smilewhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguileneighing in likeness of a filly foaland sometime lurk I in a gossips bowlin very likeness of a roasted craband when she drinks against her lips I boband on her withered dewlap pour the alethe wisest aunt telling the saddest talesometime for three-foot stool mistaketh methen slip I from her bum down topples sheand tailor cries and falls into a coughand then the whole quire hold their hips and loffand waxen in their mirth and neeze and sweara merrier hour was never wasted therebut room fairy here comes Oberonand here my mistress would that he were goneill met by moonlight proud Titania what jealous Oberon fairies skip henceI have forsworn his bed and companytarry rash wanton am not I thy lordthen I must be thy lady but I knowwhen thou hast stoln away from fairy landand in the shape of Corin sat all dayplaying on pipes of corn and versing loveto amorous Phillida why art thou herecome from the furthest steppe of Indiabut that forsooth the bounng Amazonyour buskined mistress and your warrior loveto Theseus must be wedded and you cometo give their bed joy and prosperityhow canst thou thus forshame Titaniaglance at my credit with Hippolytaknowing I know thy love to Theseusdidst thou not lead him through the glimmering nightfrom Perigouna whom he ravishedand make him with fairgle break his faithwith Ariadne and Antiopathese are the forgeries of jealousyand never since the middle summers springmet we on hill in dale forest or meadby paved fountain or by rushy brookor in the beached margent of the seato dance our ringlets to the whistling windbut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sporttherefore the winds piping to us in vainas in revenge have sucked up from the seacontagious fogs which falling in the landhave every pelting river made so proudthat they have overborne their continentsthe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vainthe ploughman lost his sweat and the green cornhath rotted ere his youth attained a beardthe fold stands empty in the drowned fieldand crows are fatted with the murrion flockthe nine mens morris is filled up with mudand the quaint mazes in the wanton greenfor lack of tread are undistinguishablethe human mortals want their winter hereno night is now with hymn or carol blesttherefore the moon the governess of floodspale in her anger washes all the airthat rheumatic diseases do aboundand thorough this distemperature we seethe seasons alter hoary-headed frostsfall in the fresh lap of the crimson roseand on old Hiems thin and icy crownan odorous chaplet of sweet summer budsis as in mockery set the spring the summerthe childing autumn angry winter changetheir wonted liveries and the mazed worldby their increase now knows not which is whichand this same progeny of evil comesfrom our debate from our dissensionwe are their parents and originaldo you amend it then it lies in youwhy should Titania cross her OberonI do but beg a little changeling boyto be my henchmanset your heart at restthe fairy land buys not the child of mehis mother was a votaress of my orderand in the spiced Indian air by nightfull often hath she gossiped by my sideand sat with me on Neptunes yellow sandsmarking the embarked traders on the floodwhen we have laughed to see the sails conceiveand grow big-bellied with the wanton windwhich she with pretty and with swimming gaitfollowing her womb then rich with my young squirewould imitate and sail upon the landto fetch me trifles and return againas from a voyage rich with merchandisebut she being mortal of that boy did dieand for her sake I do rear up her boyand for her sake I will not part with himhow long within this wood intend you stayperchance till after Theseus weddingdayif you will patiently dance in our roundand see our moonlight revels go with usif not shun me and I will spare your hauntsgive me that boy and I will go with theenot for thy fairy kingdom fairies awaywe shall chide downright if I longer staywell go thy way thou shalt not from this grovetill I torment thee for this injurymy gentle Puck come hither thou rememberestsince once I sat upon a promontoryand heard a mermaid on a dolphins backuttering such dulcet and harmonious breaththat the rude sea grew civil at her songand certain stars shot madly from their spheresto hear the sea-maids musicI remember that very time I saw but thou couldst notflying between the cold moon and the earthcupid all armed a certain aim he tookat a fair vestal throned by the westand loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bowas it should pierce a hundred thousand heartsbut I might see young Cupids fiery shaftquenched in the chaste beams of the watry moonand the imperial votaress passed onin maiden meditation fancy-freeyet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fellit fell upon a little western flowerbefore milk-white now purple with loves woundand maidens call it love-in-idlenessfetch me that flower the herb I showed thee oncethe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laidwill make or man or woman madly doteupon the next live creature that it seesfetch me this herb and be thou here againere the leviathan can swim a leagueiull put a girdle round about the earthin forty minuteshaving once this juiceiull watch Titania when she is asleepand drop the liquor of it in her eyesthe next thing then she waking looks uponbe it on lion bear or wolf or bullon meddling monkey or on busy apeshe shall pursue it with the soul of loveand ere I take this charm off from her sightas I can take it with another herbiull make her render up her page to mebut who comes here I am invisibleand I will overhear their conferenceI love thee not therefore pursue me notwhere is Lysander and fair Hermiathe one iull slay the other slayeth methou toldest me they were stoln into this woodand here am I and wood within this woodbecause I cannot meet my Hermiahence get thee gone and follow me no moreyou draw me you hard-hearted adamantbut yet you draw not iron for my heartis true as steel leave you your power to drawand I shall have no power to follow youdo I entice you do I speak you fairor rather do I not in plainest truthtell you I do not nor I cannot love youand even for that do I love you the moreI am your spaniel and Demetriusthe more you beat me I will fawn on youuse me but as your spaniel spurn me strike meneglect me lose me only give me leaveunworthy as I am to follow youwhat worser place can I beg in your loveand yet a place of high respect with methan to be used as you use your dogtempt not too much the hatred of my spiritfor I am sick when I do look on youand I am sick when I look not on youyou do impeach your modesty too muchto leave the ty and commit yourselfinto the hands of one that loves you notto trust the opportunity of nightand the ill counsel of a desert placewith the rich worth of your virginityyour virtue is my privilege for thatit is not night when I do see your facetherefore I think I am not in the nightnor doth this wood lack worlds of companyfor you in my respect are all the worldthen how can it be said I am alonewhen all the world is here to look on meiull run from thee and hide me in the brakesand leave thee to the mercy of wild beaststhe wildest hath not such a heart as yourun when you will the story shall be changedApollo flies and Daphne holds the chasethe dove pursues the griffin the mild hindmakes speed to catch the tiger bootless speedwhen cowardice pursues and valour fliesI will not stay thy questions let me goor if thou follow me do not believebut I shall do thee mischief in the wooday in the temple in the town the fieldyou do me mischief friend Demetriusyour wrongs do set a scandal on my sexwe cannot fight for love as men may dowe should be wooed and were not made to wooiull follow thee and make a heaven of hellto die upon the hand I love so wellfare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grovethou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy lovehast thou the flower there welcome wandereray there it isI pray thee give it meI know a bank whereon the wild thyme blowswhere oxlips and the nodding violet growsquite over-canopied with lusous woodbinewith sweet musk-roses and with eglantinethere sleeps Titania some time of the nightlulled in these flowers with dances and delightand there the snake throws her enamelled skinweed wide enough to wrap a fairy inand with the juice of this iull streak her eyesand make her full of hateful fantasiestake thou some of it and seek through this grovea sweet Athenian lady is in lovewith a disdainful youth anoint his eyesbut do it when the next thing he espiesmay be the lady thou shalt know the manby the Athenian garments he hath oneffect it with some care that he may provemore fond on her than she upon her loveand look thou meet me ere the first cock crowfear not my lord your servant shall do socome now a roundel and a fairy songthen for the third of a minute hencesome to kill cankers in the musk-rose budssome war with rere-mice for their leathern wingsto make my small elves coats and some keep backthe clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wondersat our quaint spirits Sing me now asleepthen to your offices and let me restthe fairies singyou spotted snakes with double tonguethorny hedge-hogs be not seennewts and blind-worms do no wrongcome not near our fairy queenphilomel with melodysing in our sweet lullabylulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullabynever harmnor spell nor charmcome our lovely lady nighso good night with lullabyweaving spiders come not herehence you long-legged spinners hencebeetles black approach not nearworm nor snail do no offencephilomel with melody &chence away now all is wellone aloof stand sentinelwhat thou seest when thou dost wakedo it for thy true-love takelove and languish for his sakebe it ounce or cat or bearpard or boar with bristled hairin thy eye that shall appearwhen thou wakest it is thy dearwake when some vile thing is nearfair love you faint with wandering in the woodand to speak troth I have forgot our waywell rest us Hermia if you think it goodand tarry for the comfort of the daybe it so Lysander find you out a bedfor I upon this bank will rest my headone turf shall serve as pillow for us bothone heart one bed two bosoms and one trothnay good Lysander for my sake my dearlie further off yet do not lie so nearO take the sense sweet of my innocencelove takes the meaning in loves conferenceI mean that my heart unto yours is knitso that but one heart we can make of ittwo bosoms interchained with an oathso then two bosoms and a single troththen by your side no bed-room me denyfor lying so Hermia I do not lielysander riddles very prettilynow much beshrew my manners and my prideif Hermia meant to say Lysander liedbut gentle friend for love and courtesylie further off in human modestysuch separation as may well be saidbecomes a virtuous bachelor and a maidso far be distant and good night sweet friendthy love neer alter till thy sweet life endamen amen to that fair prayer say Iand then end life when I end loyaltyhere is my bed sleep give thee all his restwith half that wish the wishers eyes be pressedthrough the forest have I gonebut Athenian found I noneon whose eyes I might approvethis flowers force in stirring lovenight and silence who is hereweeds of Athens he doth wearthis is he my master saiddespised the Athenian maidand here the maiden sleeping soundon the dank and dirty groundpretty soul she durst not lienear this lack-love this kill-courtesychurl upon thy eyes I throwall the power this charm doth owewhen thou wakest let love forbidsleep his seat on thy eyelidso awake when I am gonefor I must now to Oberonstay though thou kill me sweet DemetriusI charge thee hence and do not haunt me thusO wilt thou darkling leave me do not sostay on thy peril I alone will goO I am out of breath in this fond chasethe more my prayer the lesser is my gracehappy is Hermia wheresoeer she liesfor she hath blessed and attractive eyeshow came her eyes so bright not with salt tearsif so my eyes are oftener washed than hersno no I am as ugly as a bearfor beasts that meet me run away for feartherefore no marvel though Demetriusdo as a monster fly my presence thuswhat wicked and dissembling glass of minemade me compare with Hermias sphery eynebut who is here Lysander on the grounddead or asleep I see no blood no woundlysander if you live good sir awakeand run through fire I will for thy sweet saketransparent Helena nature shows artthat through thy bosom makes me see thy heartwhere is Demetrius O how fit a wordis that vile name to perish on my sworddo not say so Lysander say not sowhat though he love your Hermia lord what thoughyet Hermia still loves you then be contentcontent with Hermia no I do repentthe tedious minutes I with her have spentnot Hermia but Helena I lovewho will not change a raven for a dovethe will of man is by his reason swayedand reason says you are the worthier maidthings growing are not ripe until their seasonso I being young till now ripe not to reasonand touching now the point of human skillreason becomes the marshal to my willand leads me to your eyes where I oerlookloves stories written in loves richest bookwherefore was I to this keen mockery bornwhen at your hands did I deserve this scornisit not enough isit not enough young manthat I did never no nor never candeserve a sweet look from Demetrius eyebut you must flout my insuffiencygood troth you do me wrong good sooth you doin such disdainful manner me to woobut fare you well perforce I must confessI thought you lord of more true gentlenessO that a lady of one man refusedshould of another therefore be abusedshe sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou thereand never mayst thou come Lysander nearfor as a surfeit of the sweetest thingsthe deepest loathing to the stomach bringsor as the heresies that men do leaveare hated most of those they did deceiveso thou my surfeit and my heresyof all be hated but the most of meand all my powers address your love and mightto honour Helen and to be her knighthelp me Lysander help me do thy bestto pluck this crawling serpent from my breastay me for pity what a dream was herelysander look how I do quake with fearmethought a serpent eat my heart awayand you sat smiling at his cruel preylysander what removed Lysander lordwhat out of hearing gone no sound no wordalack where are you speak an if you hearspeak of all loves I swound almost with fearno then I well perceive you are not nigheither death or you iull find immediatelyare we all metpat pat and heres a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal this green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the dukepeter Quincewhat sayst thou bully Bottomthere are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please first Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide how answer you thatbyr lakin a parlous fearI believe we must leave the killing out when all is donenot a whit I have a device to make all well write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver this will put them out of fearwell we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and sixno make it two more let it be written in eight and eightwill not the ladies be afeard of the lionI fear it I promise youmasters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in God shield us a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to ittherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lionnay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lions neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect Ladies or fair ladies I would wish you or I would request you or I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble my life for yours if you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joinerwell it shall be so but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlightdoth the moon shine that night we play our playa calendar a calendar look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshineyes it doth shine that nightwhy then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casementay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wallyou can never bring in a wall what say you Bottomsome man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough-cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisperif that may be than all is well come sit down every mothers son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one according to his cuewhat hempen home-spuns have we swaggering hereso near the cradle of the fairy queenwhat a play toward iull be an auditoran actor too perhaps if I see causespeak Pyramus Thisby stand forththisby the flowers have odious savours sweetodorous odorousodours savours sweetso hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear but hark a voice stay thou but here

meet thee Pyramus at Ninnys tombninus tomb man why you must not speak that yet that you answer to Pyramus you speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramus enter your cue is past it is never tire

roundthrough bog through bush through brake through briersometime a horse iull be sometime a hounda hog a headless bear sometime a fireand neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burnlike horse

youbless thee Bottom bless thee thou art translatedI see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could but I will not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down here and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraidthe ousel-cock so black of huewith orange-tawny billthe throstle with his note so truethe wren with little quillwhat angel wakes me from my flowery bedthe finch the sparrow and the larkthe plain-song cuckoo graywhose note full many a man doth markand dares not answer nayfor indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo never soI pray thee gentle mortal sing againmine ear is much enamoured of thy noteso is mine eye enthralled to thy shapeand thy fair virtues force perforce doth move meon the first view to say to swear I love theemethinks mistress you should have little reason for that and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together now-a-days the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends nay I can gleek upon occasionthou art as wise as thou art beautifulnot so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turnout of this wood do not desire to gothou shalt remain here wher thou wilt or noI am a spirit of no common ratethe summer still doth tend upon my stateand I do love thee therefore go with meiull give thee fairies to attend on theeand they shall fetch thee jewels from the deepand sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepand I will purge thy mortal grossness sothat thou shalt like an airy spirit gopease-blossom cobweb moth and mustardseedreadyand Iand Iand Iwhere shall we gobe kind and courteous to this gentlemanhop in his walks and gambol in his eyesfeed him with apricocks and dewberrieswith purple grapes green figs and mulberriesthe honey-bags steal from the humble-beesand for night-tapers crop their waxen thighsand light them at the fiery glow-worms eyesto have my love to bed and to ariseand pluck the wings from painted butterfliesto fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyesnod to him elves and do him courtesieshail mortalhailhailhailI cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your worships namecobwebI shall desire you of more acquaintance good master Cobweb if I out my finger I shall make bold with you your name honest gentlemanpease-blossomI pray you commend me to mistress Squash your mother and to master Peascod your father Good master Pease-blossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too your name I beseech you sirmustard-seedgood master mustard-seed I know your patience well that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good master mustard-seedcome wait upon him lead him to my bowerthe moon methinks looks with a watery eyeand when she weeps weeps every little flowerlamenting some enforced chastitytie up my loves tongue bring him silentlyI wonder if Titania be awakedthen what it was that next came in her eyewhich she must dote on in extremityhere comes my messengerhow now mad spiritwhat night-rule now about this haunted grovemy mistress with a monster is in lovenear to her close and consecrated bowerwhile she was in her dull and sleeping houra crew of patches rude mechanicalsthat work for bread upon Athenian stallswere met together to rehearse a playintended for great Theseus nuptial daythe shallowest thick-skin of that barren sortwho Pyramus presented in their sportforsook his scene and entered in a brakewhen I did him at this advantage takean asss nowl I fixed on his headanon his Thisbe must be answeredand forth my mimick comes when they him spyas wild geese that the creeping fowler eyeor russet-pated choughs many in sortrising and cawing at the guns reportsever themselves and madly sweep the skyso at his sight away his fellows flyand at our stamp here oer and oer one fallshe murder cries and help from Athens callstheir sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strongmade senseless things begin to do them wrongfor briers and thorns at their apparel snatchsome sleeves some hats from yielders all things catchI led them on in this distracted fearand left sweet Pyramus translated therewhen in that moment so it came to passtitania waked and straightway loved an assthis falls out better than I could devisebut hast thou yet latched the Athenians eyeswith the love-juice as I did bid thee doI took him sleeping that is finished tooand the Athenian woman by his sidethat when he waked of force she must be eyedstand close this is the same Athenianthis is the woman but not this the manO why rebuke you him that loves you solay breath so bitter on your bitter foenow I but chide but I should use thee worsefor thou I fear hast given me cause to curseif thou hast slain Lysander in his sleepbeing oer shoes in blood plunge in knee deepand kill me toothe sun was not so true unto the dayas he to me would he have stoln awayfrom sleeping Hermia iull believe as soonthis whole earth may be bored and that the moonmay through the centre creep and so displeaseher brothers noontide with the Antipodesit cannot be but thou hast murdered himso should a murderer look so dead so grimso should the murdered look and so should Ipierced through the heart with your stern crueltyyet you the murderer look as bright as clearas yonder Venus in her glimmering spherewhats this to my Lysander where is heah good Demetrius wilt thou give him meI had rather give his carcass to my houndsout dog out cur thou drivest me past the boundsof maidens patience hast thou slain him thenhenceforth be never numbered among menO once tell true tell true een for my sakedurst thou have looked upon him being awakeand hast thou killed him sleeping O brave touchcould not a worm an adder do so muchan adder did it for with doubler tonguethan thine thou serpent never adder stungyou spend your passion on a misprised moodI am not guilty of Lysanders bloodnor is he dead for aught that I can tellI pray thee tell me then that he is wellan if I could what should I get thereforea privilege never to see me moreand from thy hated presence part I sosee me no more wher he be dead or nothere is no following her in this fierce veinhere therefore for awhile I will remainso sorrows heaviness doth heavier growfor debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owewhich now in some slight measure it will payif for his tender here I make some staywhat hast thou done thou hast mistaken quiteand laid the love-juice on some true-loves sightof thy misprision must perforce ensuesome true-love turned and not a false turned truethen fate oer-rules that one man holding trotha million fail confounding oath on oathabout the wood go swifter than the windand Helena of Athens look thou findall fancy-sick she is and pale of cheerwith sighs of love that cost the fresh blood dearby some illusion see thou bring her hereiull charm his eyes against she do appearI go I go look how I goswifter than arrow from the Tartars bowflower of this purple dyehit with Cupids archerysink in apple of his eyewhen his love he doth espylet her shine as gloriouslyas the Venus of the skywhen thou wakest if she be bybeg of her for remedycaptain of our fairy bandhelena is here at handand the youth mistook by mepleading for a lovers feeshall we their fond pageant seelord what fools these mortals bestand aside the noise they makewill cause Demetrius to awakethen will two at once woo onethat must needs be sport aloneand those things do best please methat befall preposterouslywhy should you think that I should woo in scornscorn and derision never come in tearslook when I vow I weep and vows so bornin their nativity all truth appearshow can these things in me seem scorn to youbearing the badge of faith to prove them trueyou do advance your cunning more and morewhen truth kills truth O devilish-holy fraythese vows are Hermias will you give her oerweigh oath with oath and you will nothing weighyour vows to her and me put in two scaleswill even weigh and both as light as talesI had no judgment when to her I sworenor none in my mind now you give her oerDemetrius loves her and he loves not youO Helen goddess nymph perfect divineto what my love shall I compare thine eynecrystal is muddy O how ripe in showthy lips those kissing cherries tempting growthis pure congealed white high Taurus snowfanned with the eastern wind turns to a crowwhen thou holdest up thy hand O let me kissthat princess of pure white this seal of blissO spite O hell I see you all are bentto set against me for your merrimentif you were civil and knew courtesyyou would not do me thus much injurycan you not hate me as I know you dobut you must join in souls to mock me tooif you were men as men you are in showyou would not use a gentle lady soto vow and swear and superpraise my partswhen I am sure you hate me with your heartsyou both are rivals and love Hermiaand now both rivals to mock Helenaa trim exploit a manly enterpriseto conjure tears up in a poor maids eyeswith your derision none of noble sortwould so offend a virgin and extorta poor souls patience all to make you sportyou are unkind Demetrius be not sofor you love Hermia this you know I knowand here with all good will with all my heartin Hermias love I yield you up my partand yours of Helena to me bequeathwhom I do love and will do to my deathnever did mockers waste more idle breathlysander keep thy Hermia I will noneif eer I loved her all that love is gonemy heart with her but as guest wise sojournedand now to Helen it is home returnedthere to remainhelen it is not sodisparage not the faith thou dost not knowlest to thy peril thou aby it dearlook where thy love comes yonder is thy deardark night that from the eye his function takesthe ear more quick of apprehension makeswherein it doth impair the seeing senseit pays the hearing double recompensethou art not by mine eye Lysander foundmine ear I thank it brought me to thy soundbut why unkindly didst thou leave me sowhy should he stay whom love doth press to gowhat love could press Lysander from my sidelysanders love that would not let him bidefair Helena who more engilds the nightthan all yon fiery oes and eyes of lightwhy seekest thou me could not this make thee knowthe hate I bear thee made me leave thee soyou speak not as you think it cannot belo she is one of this confederacynow I perceive they have conjoined all threeto fashion this false sport in spite of meinjurious Hermia most ungrateful maidhave you conspired have you with these contrivedto bait me with this foul derisionis all the counsel that we two have sharedthe sister-vows the hours that we have spentwhen we have chid the hasty-footed timefor parting us O is it all forgotall school-days friendship childhood innocencewe Hermia like two artifial godshave with our neelds created both one flowerboth on one sampler sitting on one cushionboth warbling of one song both in one keyas if our hands our sides voices and mindshad been incorporate so we grew togetherlike to a double cherry seeming partedbut yet an union in partitiontwo lovely berries moulded on one stemso with two seeming bodies but one hearttwo of the first like coats in heraldrydue but to one and crowned with one crestand will you rent our anent love asunderto join with men in scorning your poor friendit is not friendly itis not maidenlyour sex as well as I may chide you for itthough I alone do feel the injuryI am amazed at your passionate wordsI scorn you not it seems that you scorn mehave you not set Lysander as in scornto follow me and praise my eyes and faceand made your other love Demetriuswho even but now did spurn me with his footto call me goddess nymph divine and rareprecious celestial wherefore speaks he thisto her he hates and wherefore doth Lysanderdeny your love so rich within his souland tender me forsooth affectionbut by your setting on by your consentwhat though I be not so in grace as youso hung upon with love so fortunatebut miserable most to love unlovedthis you should pity rather than despiseI understand not what you mean by thisay do persever counterfeit sad looksmake mouths upon me when I turn my backwink each at other hold the sweet jest upthis sport well carried shall be chronicledif you have any pity grace or mannersyou would not make me such an argumentbut fare ye well itis partly mine own faultwhich death or absence soon shall remedystay gentle Helena hear my excusemy love my life my soul fair HelenaO excellentsweet do not scorn her soif she cannot entreat I can compelthou canst compel no more than she entreatthy threats have no more strength than her weak prayershelen I love thee by my life I doI swear by that which I will lose for theeto prove him false that says I love thee notI say I love thee more than he can doif thou say so withdraw and prove it tooquick comelysander whereto tends all thisaway you Ethiopno no hellseem to break loose take on as you would followbut yet come not you are a tame man gohang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let looseor I will shake thee from me like a serpentwhy are you grown so rude what change is thissweet lovethy love out tawny Tartar outout loathed medine hated poison hencedo you not jestyes sooth and so do youDemetrius I will keep my word with theeI would I had your bond for I perceivea weak bond holds you iull not trust your wordwhat should I hurt her strike her kill her deadalthough I hate her iull not harm her sowhat can you do me greater harm than hatehate me wherefore O me what news my loveam not I Hermia are not you LysanderI am as fair now as I was erewhilesince night you loved me yet since night you left mewhy then you left me O the gods forbidin earnest shall I sayay by my lifeand never did desire to see thee moretherefore be out of hope of question doubtbe certain nothing truer itis no jestthat I do hate thee and love HelenaO me you juggler you canker-blossomyou thief of love what have you come by nightand stoln my loves heart from himfine infaithhave you no modesty no maiden shameno touch of bashfulness what will you tearimpatient answers from my gentle tonguefie fie you counterfeit you puppet youpuppet why so ay that way goes the gamenow I perceive that she hath made comparebetween our statures she hath urged her heightand with her personage her tall personageher height forsooth she hath prevailed with himand are you grown so high in his esteembecause I am so dwarfish and so lowhow low am I thou painted maypole speakhow low am I I am not yet so lowbut that my nails can reach unto thine eyesI pray you though you mock me gentlemenlet her not hurt me I was never curstI have no gift at all in shrewishnessI am a right maid for my cowardicelet her not strike me you perhaps may thinkbecause she is something lower than myselfthat I can match herlower hark againgood Hermia do not be so bitter with meI evermore did love you Hermiadid ever keep your counsels never wronged yousave that in love unto DemetriusI told him of your stealth unto this woodhe followed you for love I followed himbut he hath chid me hence and threatened meto strike me spurn me nay to kill me tooand now so you will let me quiet goto Athens will I bear my folly backand follow you no further let me goyou see how simple and how fond I amwhy get you gone who isit that hinders youa foolish heart that I leave here behindwhat with Lysanderwith Demetriusbe not afraid she shall not harm thee Helenano sir she shall not though you take her partO when shes angry she is keen and shrewdshe was a vixen when she went to schooland though she be but little she is fiercelittle again nothing but low and little why will you suffer her to flout me thuslet me come to herget you gone you dwarfyou minimus of hindering knot-grass madeyou bead you acornyou are too offiousin her behalf that scorns your serviceslet her alone speak not of Helenatake not her part for if thou dost intendnever so little show of love to herthou shalt aby itnow she holds me notnow follow if thou darest to try whose rightor thine or mine is most in Helenafollow nay iull go with thee cheek by joleyou mistress all this coil is long of younay go not backI will not trust you Inor longer stay in your curst companyyour hands than mine are quicker for a fraymy legs are longer though to run awayI am amazed and know not what to saythis is thy negligence still thou mistakestor else commitest thy knaveries wilfullybelieve me king of shadows I mistookdid not you tell me I should know the manby the Athenian garments he had onand so far blameless proves my enterprisethat I have nointed an Athenians eyesand so far am I glad it so did sortas this their jangling I esteem a sportthou seeist these lovers seek a place to fighthie therefore Robin overcast the nightthe starry welking cover thou anonwith drooping fog as black as Acheronand lead these testy rivals so astrayas one come not within anothers waylike to Lysander sometime frame thy tonguethen stir Demetrius up with bitter wrongand sometime rail thou like Demetriusand from each other look thou lead them thustill oer their brows death-counterfeiting sleepwith leaden legs and batty wings doth creepthen crush this herb into Lysanders eyewhose liquor hath this virtuous propertyto take from thence all error with his mightand make his eyeballs roll with wonted sightwhen they next wake all this derisionshall seem a dream and fruitless visionand back to Athens shall the lovers wendwith league whose date till death shall never endwhiles I in this affair do thee employiull to my queen and beg her Indian boyand then I will her charmed eye releasefrom monsters view and all things shall be peacemy fairy lord this must be done with hastefor nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fastand yonder shines Auroras harbingerat whose approach ghosts wandering here and theretroop home to churchyards damned spirits allthat in cross-ways and floods have burialalready to their wormy beds are gonefor fear lest day should look their shames uponthey wilfully themselves exile from lightand must for aye consort with black-browed nightbut we are spirits of another sortI with the mornings love have oft made sportand like a forester the groves may treadeven till the eastern gate all fiery-redopening on Neptune with fair blessed beamsturns into yellow gold his salt green-streamsbut notwithstanding haste make no delaywe may effect this business yet ere dayup and down up and downI will lead them up and downI am feared in field and towngoblin lead them up and downhere comes onewhere art thou proud Demetrius speak thou nowhere villain drawn and ready where art thouI will be with thee straightfollow me thento plainer groundlysander speak againthou runaway thou coward art thou fledspeak in some bush where dost thou hide thy headthou coward art thou bragging to the starstelling the bushes that thou lookest for warsand wilt not come come recreant come thou childiull whip thee with a rod he is defiledthat draws a sword on theeyea art thou therefollow my voice well try no manhood herehe goes before me and still dares me onwhen I come where he calls then he is gonethe villain is much lighter-heeled than II followed fast but faster he did flythat fallen am I in dark uneven wayand here will rest mecome thou gentle dayfor if but once thou show me thy grey lightiull find Demetrius and revenge this spiteho ho ho Coward why comest thou notabide me if thou darest for well I wotthou runnest before me shifting every placeand darest not stand nor look me in the facewhere art thou nowcome hither I am herenay then thou mockest me thou shalt buy this dearif ever I thy face by daylight seenow go thy way faintness constraineth meto measure out my length on this cold bedby days approach look to be visitedO weary night O long and tedious nightabate thy hours shine comforts from the eastthat I may back to Athens by daylightfrom these that my poor company detestand sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrows eyesteal me awhile from mine own companyyet but three come one moretwo of both kinds make up fourhere she comes curst and sadcupid is a knavish ladthus to make poor females madnever so weary never so in woebedabbled with the dew and torn with briersI can no further crawl no further gomy legs can keep no pace with my desireshere will I rest me till the break of dayheavens shield Lysander if they mean a frayon the groundsleep soundiull applyto your eyegentle lover remedywhen thou wakestthou takesttrue delightin the sightof thy former ladys eyeand the country proverb knownthat every man should take his ownin your waking shall be shownjack shall have Jillnought shall go illthe man shall have his mare againand all shall be wellcome sit thee down upon this flowery bedwhile I thy amiable cheeks do coyand stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth headand kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joywheres Pease-blossomreadyscratch my head Pease-blossom wheres Mounsieur Cobwebreadymounsieur Cobweb good mounsieur get your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle and good mounsieur bring me the honey-bag do not fret yourself

neaf Mounsieur Mustard-seed pray you leave your curtsy good mounsieurwhats your willnothing good mounsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch I must to the barbers mounsieur for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face and I am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me I must scratchwhat wilt thou hear some music my sweet loveI have a reasonable good ear in music let us have the tongs and the bonesor say sweet love what thou desirest to eattruly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay good hay sweet hay hath no fellowI have a venturous fairy that shall seekthe squirrels hoard and fetch thee thence new nutsI had rather have a handful or two of dried pease but I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon mesleep thou and I will wind thee in my armsfairies be gone and be all ways awayso doth the woodbine the sweet honeysucklegently entwist the female ivy soenrings the barky fingers of the elmO how I love thee how I dote on theewelcome good Robin seeist thou this sweet sighther dotage now I do begin to pityfor meeting her of late behind the woodseeking sweet favours for this hateful foolI did upbraid her and fall out with herfor she his hairy temples then had roundedwith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowersand that same dew which sometime on the budswas wont to swell like round and orient pearlsstood now within the pretty flowerets eyeslike tears that did their own disgrace bewailwhen I had at my pleasure taunted herand she in mild terms begged my patienceI then did ask of her her changeling childwhich straight she gave me and her fairy sentto bear him to my bower in fairy landand now I have the boy I will undothis hateful imperfection of her eyesand gentle Puck take this transformed scalpfrom off the head of this Athenian swainthat he awaking when the other domay all to Athens back again repairand think no more of this nights acdentsbut as the fierce vexation of a dreambut first I will release the fairy queenbe as thou wast wont to besee as thou wast wont to seedians bud oer Cupids flowerhath such force and blessed powernow my Titania wake you my sweet queenmy Oberon what visions have I seenmethought I was enamoured of an assthere lies your lovehow came these things to passO how mine eyes do loathe his visage nowsilence awhile Robin take off this headtitania music call and strike more deadthan common sleep of all these five the sensemusic ho music such as charmeth sleepwhen thou wakest with thine own fools eyes peepsound musiccome my queen take hands with meand rock the ground whereon these sleepers benow thou and I are new in amityand will to-morrow midnight solemnlydance in duke Theseus house triumphantlyand bless it to all fair prosperitythere shall the pairs of faithful lovers bewedded with Theseus all in jollityfairy king attend and markI do hear the morning larkthen my queen in silence sadtrip we after the nights shadewe the globe can compass soonswifter than the wandering mooncome my lord and in our flighttell me how it came this nightthat I sleeping here was foundwith these mortals on the groundgo one of you find out the foresterfor now our observation is performedand since we have the vaward of the daymy love shall hear the music of my houndsuncouple in the western valley let them godispatch I say and find the foresterwe will fair queen up to the mountains topand mark the musical confusionof hounds and echo in conjunctionI was with Hercules and Cadmus oncewhen in a wood of Crete they bayed the bearwith hounds of Sparta never did I hearsuch gallant chiding for besides the grovesthe skies the fountains every region nearseemed all one mutual cry I never heardso musical a discord such sweet thundermy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kindso flewed so sanded and their heads are hungwith ears that sweep away the morning dewcrook-kneeed and dew-lapped like Thessalian bullsslow in pursuit but matched in mouth like bellseach under each a cry more tuneablewas never hollaed to nor cheered with hornin Crete in Sparta nor in Thessalyjudge when you hear but soft what nymphs are thesemy lord this is my daughter here asleepand this Lysander this Demetrius isthis Helena old Nedars HelenaI wonder of their being here togetherno doubt they rose up early to observethe rite of May and hearing our intentcame here in grace of our solemnitybut speak Egeus is not this the daythat Hermia should give answer of her choiceit is my lordgo bid the huntsmen wake them with their hornsgood morrow friends Saint Valentine is pastbegin these wood-birds but to couple nowpardon my lordI pray you all stand upI know you two are rival enemieshow comes this gentle concord in the worldthat hatred is so far from jealousyto sleep by hate and fear no enmitymy lord I shall reply amazedlyhalf sleep half waking but as yet I swearI cannot truly say how I came herebut as I think for truly would I speakand now I do bethink me so it isI came with Hermia hither our intentwas to be gone from Athens where we mightwithout the peril of the Athenian lawenough enough my lord you have enoughI beg the law the law upon his headthey would have stoln away they would Demetriusthereby to have defeated you and meyou of your wife and me of my consentof my consent that she should be your wifemy lord fair Helen told me of their stealthof this their purpose hither to this woodand I in fury hither followed themfair Helena in fancy following mebut my good lord I wot not by what powerbut by some power it is my love to Hermiamelted as doth the snow seems to me nowas the remembrance of an idle gaudwhich in my childhood I did dote uponand all the faith the virtue of my heartthe object and the pleasure of mine eyeis only Helena to her my lordwas I betrothed ere I saw Hermiabut like in sickness did I loathe this foodbut as in health come to my natural tastenow do I wish it love it long for itand will for evermore be true to itfair lovers you are fortunately metof this discourse we more will hear anonegeus I will overbear your willfor in the temple by and by with usthese couples shall eternally be knitand for the morning now is something wornour purposed hunting shall be set asideaway with us to Athens three and threewell hold a feast in great solemnitycome Hippolytathese things seem small and undistinguishablelike far-off mountains turned into cloudsmethinks I see these things with parted eyewhen everything seems doubleso methinksand I have found Demetrius like a jewelmine own and not mine ownare you surethat we are awake it seems to methat yet we sleep we dream do you not thinkthe duke was here and bid us follow himyea and my fatherand Hippolytaand he did bid us follow to the templewhy then we are awake lets follow himand by the way let us recount our dreamswhen my cue comes call me and I will answer my next is most fair Pyramus heigh-ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows-mender snout the tinker Starveling Gods my life stolen hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen mans hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called Bottoms Dream because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her deathhave you sent to Bottoms house is he come home yethe cannot be heard of out of doubt he is transportedif he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth itit is not possible you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but heno he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athensyea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voiceyou must say paragon a paramour is God bless us a thing of naughtmasters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward we had all been made menO sweet bully Bottom thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus iull be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus or nothingwhere are these lads where are these heartsbottom O most courageous day O most happy hourmasters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if I tell you I am no true Athenian I will tell you everything right as it fell outlet us hear sweet Bottomnot a word of me All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look oer his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred in any case let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lions claws and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words away go awayitis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak ofmore strange than true I never may believethese antique fables nor these fairy toyslovers and madmen have such seething brainssuch shaping fantasies that apprehendmore than cool reason ever comprehendsthe lunatic the lover and the poetare of imagination all compactone sees more devils than vast hell can holdthat is the madman the lover all as franticsees Helens beauty in a brow of Egyptthe poets eye in a fine frenzy rollingdoth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heavenand as imagination bodies forththe forms of things unknown the poets penturns them to shapes and gives to airy nothinga local habitation and a namesuch tricks hath strong imaginationthat if it would but apprehend some joyit comprehends some bringer of that joyor in the night imagining some fearhow easy is a bush supposed a bearbut all the story of the night told overand all their minds transfigured so togethermore witnesseth than fancys imagesand grows to something of great constancybut howsoever strange and admirablehere come the lovers full of joy and mirthjoy gentle friends joy and fresh days of loveaccompany your heartsmore than to uswait in your royal walks your board your bedcome now what masques what dances shall we haveto wear away this long age of three hoursbetween our after-supper and bed-timewhere is our usual manager of mirthwhat revels are in hand is there no playto ease the anguish of a torturing hourcall Philostratehere mighty Theseussay what abridgment have you for this eveningwhat masque what music how shall we beguilethe lazy time if not with some delightthere is a brief how many sports are ripemake choice of which your highness will see firstthe battle with the Centaurs to be sungby an Athenian eunuch to the harpwell none of that that have I told my lovein glory of my kinsman Herculesthe riot of the tipsy Bacchanalstearing the Thraan singer in their ragethat is an old device and it was playedwhen I from Thebes came last a conquerorthe thrice three muses mourning for the deathof Learning late deceased in beggarythat is some satire keen and criticalnot sorting with a nuptial ceremonya tedious brief scene of young Pyramusand his love Thisbe very tragical mirthmerry and tragical tedious and briefthat is hot ice and wonderous strange snowhow shall we find the concord of this discorda play there is my lord some ten words longwhich is as brief as I have known a playbut by ten words my lord it is too longwhich makes it tedious for in all the playthere is not one word apt one player fittedand tragical my noble lord it isfor Pyramus therein doth kill himselfwhich when I saw rehearsed I must confessmade mine eyes water but more merry tearsthe passion of loud laughter never shedwhat are they that do play ithard-handed men that work in Athens herewhich never laboured in their minds till nowand now have toiled their unbreathed memorieswith this same play against your nuptialand we will hear itno my noble lordit is not for you I have heard it overand it is nothing nothing in the worldunless you can find sport in their intentsextremely stretched and conned with cruel painto do you serviceI will hear that playfor never anything can be amisswhen simpleness and duty tender itgo bring them in and take your places ladiesI love not to see wretchedness oerchargedand duty in his service perishingwhy gentle sweet you shall see no such thinghe says they can do nothing in this kindthe kinder we to give them thanks for nothingour sport shall be to take what they mistakeand what poor duty cannot do noble respecttakes it in might not meritwhere I have come great clerks have purposedto greet me with premeditated welcomeswhere I have seen them shiver and look palemake periods in the midst of sentencesthrottle their practised accent in their fearsand in conclusion dumbly have broke offnot paying me a welcome trust me sweetout of this silence yet I picked a welcomeand in the modesty of fearful dutyI read as much as from the rattling tongueof saucy and audaous eloquencelove therefore and tongue-tied simplityin least speak most to my capatyso please your grace the prologue is addressedlet him approachif we offend it is with our good willthat you should think we come not to offendbut with good will to show our simple skillthat is the true beginning of our endconsider then we come but in despitewe do not come as minding to content youour true intent is All for your delightwe are not here that you should here repent youthe actors are at hand and by their showyou shall know all that you are like to knowthis fellow doth not stand upon pointshe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak trueindeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in governmenthis speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is nextgentles perchance you wonder at this showbut wonder on till truth make all things plainthis man is Pyramus if you would knowthis beauteous lady Thisby is certainthis man with lime and rough-cast doth presentwall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunderand through Walls chink poor souls they are contentto whisper at the which let no man wonderthis man with lanthorn dog and bush of thornpresenteth moonshine for if you will knowby moonshine did these lovers think no scornto meet at Ninus tomb there there to woothis grisly beast which Lion hight by namethe trusty Thisby coming first by nightdid scare away or rather did affrightand as she fied her mantle she did fallwhich Lion vile with bloody mouth did stainanon comes Pyramus sweet youth and talland finds his trusty Thisbys mantle slainwhereat with blade with bloody blameful bladehe bravely broached his boiling bloody breastand Thisby tarrying in mulberry shadehis dagger drew and died for all the restlet Lion moonshine Wall and lovers twainat large discourse while here they do remainI wonder if the lion be to speakno wonder my lord one lion may when many asses dowall in this same interlude it doth befallthat I one snout by name present a walland such a wall as I would have you thinkthat had in it a crannied hole or chinkthrough which the lovers Pyramus and Thisbydid whisper often very secretlythis loam this rough-cast and this stone doth showthat I am that same wall the truth is soand this the cranny is right and sinisterthrough which the fearful lovers are to whisperwould you desire lime and hair to speak betterit is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lordpyramus draws near the wall silenceO grim-looked night O night with hue so blackO night which ever art when day is notO night O night alack alack alackI fear my Thisbys promise is forgotand thou O wall O sweet O lovely wallthat standest between her fathers ground and minethou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wallshow me thy chink to blink through with mine eynethanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for thisbut what see I no Thisby do I seeO wicked wall through whom I see no blisscursed be thy stones for thus deceiving methe wall methinks being sensible should curse againno in truth sir he should not edeceiving me is Thisbys cue she is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she comesO wall full often hast thou heard my moansfor parting my fair Pyramus and memy cherry lips have often kissed thy stonesthy stones with lime and hair knit up in theeI see a voice now will I to the chinkto spy an I can hear my Thisbys facethisbymy love thou art my love I thinkthink what thou wilt I am thy lovers graceand like Limander am I trusty stilland I like Helen till the fates me killnot Shafalus to Procrus was so trueas Shafalus to Procrus I to youO kiss me through the hole of this vile wallI kiss the walls hole not your lips at allwilt thou at Ninnys tomb meet me straightwaytide life tide death I come without delaythus have I Wall my part discharged soand being done thus Wall away doth gonow is the mural down between the two neighboursno remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warningthis is the silliest stuff that ever I heardthe best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend themit must be your imagination then and not theirsif we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lionyou ladies you whose gentle hearts do fearthe smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floormay now perchance both quake and tremble herewhen lion rough in wildest rage doth roarthen know that I one Snug the joiner ama lion-fell nor else no lions damfor if I should as lion come in strifeinto this place itwere pity on my lifea very gentle beast and of a good consencethe very best at a beast my lord that eer I sawthis lion is a very fox for his valourtrue and a goose for his discretionnot so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goosehis discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moonthis lanthorn doth the horned moon presenthe should have worn the horns on his headhe is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the rcumferencethis lanthorn doth the horned moon presentmyself the man inthe moon do seem to bethis is the greatest error of all the restthe man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man inthe moonhe dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuffI am aweary of this moon would he would changeit appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the timeproceed Moonall that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this thorn-bush my thorn-bush and this dog my dogwhy all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes Thisbethis is old Ninnys tomb where is my loveohwell roared Lionwell run Thisbewell shone Moon truly the moon shines with a good gracewell moused Lionand then came Pyramusand so the lion vanishedsweet moon I thank thee for thy sunny beamsI thank thee moon for shining now so brightfor by thy gracious golden glittering streamsI trust to taste of truest Thisbys sightbut stay O spitebut mark poor knightwhat dreadful dole is hereeyes do you seehow can it beO dainty duck O dearthy mantle goodwhat stained with bloodapproach ye furies fellO fates come comecut thread and thrumquail crush conclude and quellthis passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sadbeshrew my heart but I pity the manO wherefore nature didst thou lions framesince lion vile hath here deflowered my dearwhich is no no which was the fairest damethat lived that loved that liked that looked with cheercome tears confoundout sword and woundthe pap of Pyramusay that left papwhere heart doth hopthus die I thus thus thusnow am I deadnow am I fledmy soul is in the skytongue lose thy lightmoon take thy flightnow die die die die dieno die but an ace for him for he is but oneless than an ace man for he is dead he is nothingwith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an asshow chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lovershe will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the playmethinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be briefa mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us she for a woman God bless usshe hath spied him already with those sweet eyesand thus she moans videlicetasleep my lovewhat dead my doveO Pyramus arisespeak speak quite dumbdead dead a tombmust cover thy sweet eyesthese lily lipsthis cherry nosethese yellow cowslip cheeksare gone are gonelovers make moanhis eyes were green as leeksO Sisters Threecome come to mewith hands as pale as milklay them in goresince you have shorewith shears his thread of silktongue not a wordcome trusty swordcome blade my breast imbrueand farewell friendsthus Thisby endsadieu adieu adieumoonshine and Lion are left to bury the deaday and Wall toono I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our companyno epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your Bergomask let your epilogue alonethe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelvelovers to bed itis almost fairy timeI fear we shall out-sleep the coming mornas much as we this night have overwatchedthis palpable-gross play hath well beguiledthe heavy gait of night sweet friends to beda fortnight hold we this solemnityin nightly revels and new jollitynow the hungry lion roarsand the wolf behowls the moonwhilst the heavy ploughman snoresall with weary task fordonenow the wasted brands do glowwhilst the screech-owl screeching loudputs the wretch that lies in woein remembrance of a shroudnow it is the time of nightthat the graves all gaping wideevery one lets forth his spritein the church-way paths to glideand we fairies that do runby the triple Hecates teamfrom the presence of the sunfollowing darkness like a dreamnow are frolic not a mouseshall disturb this hallowed houseI am sent with broom beforeto sweep the dust behind the doorthrough the house give glimmering lightby the dead and drowsy fireevery elf and fairy spritehop as light as bird from brierand this ditty after mesing and dance it trippinglyfirst rehearse your song by roteto each word a warbling notehand in hand with fairy gracewill we sing and bless this placenow until the break of daythrough this house each fairy strayto the best bride-bed will wewhich by us shall blessed beand the issue there createever shall be fortunateso shall all the couples threeever true in loving beand the blots of natures handshall not in their issue standnever mole hare-lip nor scarnor mark prodigious such as aredespised in nativityshall upon their children bewith this field-dew consecrateevery fairy take his gaitand each several chamber blessthrough this palace with sweet peaceever shall in safety restand the owner of it blesttrip awaymake no staymeet me all by break of dayif we shadows have offendedthink but this and all is mendedthat you have but slumbered herewhile these visions did appearand this weak and idle themeno more yielding but a dreamgentles do not reprehendif you pardon we will mendand as im an honest Puckif we have unearned lucknow to scape the serpents tonguewe will make amends ere longelse the Puck a liar callso good night unto you allgive me your hands if we be friendsand Robin shall restore amendsin delivering my son from me I bury a second husbandand I in going madam weep oer my fathers death anew but I must attend his majestys command to whom I am now in ward evermore in subjectionyou shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundancewhat hope is there of his majestys amendmenthe hath abandoned his physians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by timethis young gentlewoman had a father O that had how sad a passage itis whose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work would for the kings sake he were living I think it would be the death of the kings diseasehow called you the man you speak of madamhe was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so Gerard de Narbonhe was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortalitywhat is it my good lord the king languishes ofa fistula my lordI heard not of it beforeI would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbonhis sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodnessyour commendations madam get from her tearsitis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek no more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have itI do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it toomoderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the livingif the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortalmadam I desire your holy wisheshow understand we thatbe thou blest Bertram and succeed thy fatherin manners as in shape thy blood and virtuecontend for empire in thee and thy goodnessshare with thy birthright love all trust a fewdo wrong to none be able for thine enemyrather in power than use and keep thy friendunder thy own lifes key be checked for silencebut never taxed for speech what heaven more willthat thee may furnish and my prayers pluck downfall on thy head farewell my lorditis an unseasoned courtier good my lordadvise himhe cannot want the bestthat shall attend his loveheaven bless him farewell Bertramthe best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of herfarewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your fatherO were that all I think not on my fatherand these great tears grace his remembrance morethan those I shed for him what was he likeI have forgot him my imaginationcarries no favour init but BertramsI am undone there is no living noneif Bertram be away it were all onethat I should love a bright particular starand think to wed it he is so above mein his bright radiance and collateral lightmust I be comforted not in his spherethe ambition in my love thus plagues itselfthe hind that would be mated by the lionmust die for love itwas pretty though a plagueto see him every hour to sit and drawhis arched brows his hawking eye his curlsin our hearts table heart too capableof every line and trick of his sweet favourbut now hes gone and my idolatrous fancymust sanctify his reliques who comes hereone that goes with him I love him for his sakeand yet I know him a notorious liarthink him a great way fool solely a cowardyet these fixed evils sit so fit in himthat they take place when virtues steely boneslook bleak in the cold wind withal full oft we seecold wisdom waiting on superfluous follysave you fair queenand you monarchnoand noare you meditating on virginityay you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against himkeep him outbut he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some war-like resistancethere is none man sitting down before you will undermine you and blow you upbless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up is there no military policy how virgins might blow up menvirginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your ty it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost that you were made of is metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost itis too cold a companion away withtI will stand forit a little though therefore I die a virgintheres little can be said init itis against the rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self-love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon keepit not you cannot choose but lose byt out witht within the year it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the prinpal itself not much the worse away withthow might one do sir to lose it to her own likinglet me see marry ill to like him that neer it likes itis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth off witht while itis vendible answer the time of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our French withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry itis a withered pear it was formerly better marry yet itis a withered pear Will you anything with itnot my virginity yetthere shall your master have a thousand lovesa mother and a mistress and a frienda phoenix captain and an enemya guide a goddess and a sovereigna counsellor a traitress and a dearhis humble ambition proud humilityhis jarring concord and his discord dulcethis faith his sweet disaster with a worldof pretty fond adoptious christendomsthat blinking Cupid gossips now shall heI know not what he shall God send him wellthe courts a learning-place and he is onewhat one infaiththat I wish well itis pitywhats pitythat wishing well had not a body initwhich might be felt that we the poorer bornwhose baser stars do shut us up in wishesmight with effects of them follow our friendsand show what we alone must think which neverreturns us thanksmonsieur Parolles my lord calls for youlittle Helen farewell if I can remember thee I will think of thee at courtmonsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable starunder Mars II espeally think under Marswhy under Marsthe wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Marswhen he was predominantwhen he was retrograde I think ratherwhy think you soyou go so much backward when you fightthats for advantageso is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear wellI am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away farewell when thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee so farewellour remedies oft in ourselves do liewhich we ascribe to heaven the fated skygives us free scope only doth backward pullour slow designs when we ourselves are dullwhat power is it which mounts my love so highthat makes me see and cannot feed mine eyethe mightiest space in fortune nature bringsto join like likes and kiss like native thingsimpossible be strange attempts to thosethat weigh their pains in sense and do supposewhat hath been cannot be who ever stroveto show her merit that did miss her lovethe kings disease my project may deceive mebut my intents are fixed and will not leave methe Florentines and Senoys are by the earshave fought with equal fortune and continuea braving warso itis reported sirnay itis most credible we here receive ita certainty vouched from our cousin Austriawith caution that the Florentine will move usfor speedy aid wherein our dearest friendprejudicates the business and would seemto have us make denialhis love and wisdomapproved so to your majesty may pleadfor amplest credencehe hath armed our answerand Florence is denied before he comesyet for our gentlemen that mean to seethe Tuscan service freely have they leaveto stand on either partit well may servea nursery to our gentry who are sickfor breathing and exploitwhats he comes hereit is the Count Rousillon my good lordyoung Betramyouth thou bearest thy fathers facefrank nature rather curious than in hastehath well composed thee thy fathers moral partsmayst thou inherit too welcome to Parismy thanks and duty are your majestysI would I had that corporal soundness nowas when thy father and myself in friendshipfirst tried our soldiership he did look farinto the service of the time and wasdispled of the bravest he lasted longbut on us both did haggish age steal onand wore us out of act it much repairs meto talk of your good father in his youthhe had the wit which I can well observeto-day in our young lords but they may jesttill their own scorn return to them unnotedere they can hide their levity in honourso like a courtier contempt nor bitternesswere in his pride or sharpness if they werehis equal had awaked them and his honourclock to itself knew the true minute whenexception bid him speak and at this timehis tongue obeyed his hand who were below himhe used as creatures of another placeand bowed his eminent top to their low ranksmaking them proud of his humilityin their poor praise he humbled such a manmight be a copy to these younger timeswhich followed well would demonstrate them nowbut goers backwardhis good remembrance sirlies richer in your thoughts than on his tombso in approof lives not his epitaphas in your royal speechwould I were with him he would always saymethinks I hear him now his plausive wordshe scattered not in ears but grafted themto grow there and to bear let me not live thus his good melancholy oft beganon the catastrophe and heel of pastimewhen it was out let me not live quoth heafter my flame lacks oil to be the snuffof younger spirits whose apprehensive sensesall but new things disdain whose judgments aremere fathers of their garments whose constanesexpire before their fashions this he wishedI after him do after him wish toosince I nor wax nor honey can bring homeI quickly were dissolved from my hiveto give some labourers roomyou are loved sirthey that least lend it you shall lack you firstI fill a place I knowt how long isit countsince the physian at your fathers diedhe was much famedsome six months since my lordif he were living I would try him yetlend me an arm the rest have worn me outwith several applications nature and sicknessdebate it at their leisure welcome countmy sons no dearerthank your majestyI will now hear what say you of this gentlewomanmadam the care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish themwhat does this knave here get you gone sirrah the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe itis my slowness that I do not for I know you lack not folly to

stranger sense her matter was she loved your son fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities

royal thoughtsa modest one to bear me back againI cannot give thee less to be called gratefulthou thoughtest to help me and such thanks I giveas one near death to those that wish him livebut what at full I know thou knowest no partI knowing all my peril thou no artwhat I can do can do no hurt to trysince you set up your rest gainst remedyhe that of greatest works is finisheroft does them by the weakest ministerso holy writ in babes hath judgment shownwhen judges have been babes great floods have flownfrom simple sources and great seas have driedwhen miracles have by the greatest

confidencewhat darest thou venturetax of impudencea strumpets boldness a divulged shametraduced by odious ballads my maidens nameseared otherwise nay worse if worse extendedwith vilest torture let my life be endedmethinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speakhis powerful sound within an organ weakand what impossibility would slayin common sense sense saves another waythy life is dear for all that life can rateworth name of life in thee hath estimateyouth beauty wisdom courage virtue allthat happiness and prime can happy callthou this to hazard needs must intimateskill

deserved not helping deaths my feebut if I help what do you promise memake thy demandbut will you make it evenay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaventhen shalt thou give me with thy kingly handwhat husband in thy power I will commandexempted be from me the arroganceto choose from forth the royal blood of Francemy low and humble name to propagatewith any branch or image of thy statebut such a one thy vassal whom I knowis free for me to ask thee to bestowhere is my hand the premises observedthy will by my performance shall be servedso make the choice of thy own time for

and lowly taught I know my business is but to the courtto the court why what place make you speal when you put off that with such contempt but to the court truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court he that cannot make a leg put offs cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say presely were not for the court but for me I have an answer will serve all menmarry thats a bountiful answer that fits all questionsit is like a barbers chair that fits all buttocks the pin-buttock the quatch-buttock the brawn-buttock or any buttockwill your answer serve fit to all questionsas fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your French crown for your taffeta punk as Tibs rush for Toms forefinger as a pancake for Shrove-tuesday a morris for Mayday as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave as the nuns lip to the friars mouth nay as the pudding to his skinhave you I say an answer of such fitness for all questionsfrom below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit any questionit must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demandsbut a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should speak truth of it here it is and all that belongs toit ask me if I am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learnto be young again if we could I will be a fool in question hoping to be the wiser by your answer I pray you sir are you a courtierO lord sir theres a simple putting off more more a hundred of themsir I am a poor

employment for you you understand memost fruitfully I am there before my legshaste you againthey say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless hence is it that we make trifles of terrors ensconng ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fearwhy itis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter timesand so itisto be relinquished of the artistsso I sayboth of galen and Paracelsusso I sayof all the learned and authentic fellowsright so I saythat gave him out incurablewhy there itis so say I toonot to be helpedright as itwere a man assured of auncertain life and sure deathjust you say well so would I have saidI may truly say it is a novelty to the worldit is indeed if you will have it in showing you shall read it in what do you call therea showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actorthats it I would have said the very samewhy your dolphin is not lustier fore me I speak in respectnay itis strange itis very strange that is the brief and the tedious of it and he is of a most fanorous spirit that will not acknowledge it to be thevery hand of heavenay so I sayin a most weak and debile minister great power great transcendence which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king as to be generally thankfulI would have said it you say well here comes the kinglustig as the Dutchman says iull like a maid the better whilst I have a tooth in my head why hes able to lead her a

only title thou disdainest in her the whichI can build up Strange is it that our bloodsof colour weight and heat poured all togetherwould quite confound distinction yet stand offin differences so mighty if she beall that is virtuous save what thou dislikesta poor physians daughter thou dislikestof virtue for the name but do not sofrom lowest place when virtuous things proceedthe place is dignified by the doers deedwhere great additions swells and virtue noneit is a dropsied honour Good aloneis good without a name vileness is sothe property by what it is should gonot by the title she is young wise fairin these to nature shes immediate heirand these breed honour that is honours scornwhich challenges itself as honours bornand is not like the sire honours thrivewhen rather from our acts we them derivethan our foregoers the mere words a slavedeboshed on every tomb on every gravea lying trophy and as oft is dumbwhere dust and damned oblivion is the tombof honoured bones indeed what should be saidif thou canst like this creature as a maidI can create the rest virtue and sheis her own dower honour and wealth from meI cannot love her nor will strive to

that wilt not knowit is in us to plant thine honour wherewe please to have it grow Check thy contemptobey our will which travails in thy goodbelieve not thy disdain but presentlydo thine own fortunes that obedient rightwhich both thy duty owes and our power claimsor I will throw thee from my care for everinto the staggers and the careless lapseof youth and ignorance both my revenge and hateloosing upon thee in the name of justicewithout all terms of pity speak thine answerpardon my gracious lord for I submitmy fancy to your eyes when I considerwhat great creation and what dole of honourflies where you bid it I find that she which latewas in my nobler thoughts most base is nowthe praised of the king who so ennobledis as itwere born sotake her by the handand tell her she is thine to whom I promisea counterpoise if not to thy estatea balance more repleteI take her handgood fortune and the favour of the kingsmile upon this contract whose ceremonyshall seem expedient on the now-born briefand be performed to-night the solemn feastshall more attend upon the coming spaceexpecting absent friends as thou lovest herthy loves to me religious else does

hears most nobly of himhis face I know notwhatsoeer he ishes bravely taken here he stole from Franceas itis reported for the king had married himagainst his liking think you it is soay surely mere the truth I know his ladythere is a gentleman that serves the countreports but coarsely of herwhats his namemonsieur ParollesO I believe with himin argument of praise or to the worthof the great count himself she is too meanto have her name repeated all her deservingis a reserved honesty and thatI have not heard examinedalas poor ladyitis a hard bondage to become the wifeof a detesting lorday right good creature wheresoeer she isher heart weighs sadly this young maid might do hera shrewd turn if she pleasedhow do you meanmay be the amorous count solits herin the unlawful purposehe does indeedand brokes with all that can in such a suitcorrupt the tender honour of a maidbut she is armed for him and keeps her guardin honestest defencethe gods forbid elseso now they comethat is Antonio the dukes eldest sonthat Escaluswhich is the Frenchmanhethat with the plume itis a most gallant fellowI would he loved his wife if he were honesterhe were much goodlier isit not a handsome gentlemanI like him wellitis pity he is not honest yonds that same knavethat leads him to these places were I his ladyI would poison that vile rascalwhich is hethat jack-an-apes with scarfs why is he melancholyperchance hes hurt inthe battlelose our drum wellhes shrewdly vexed at somethinglook he has spied usmarry hang youand your courtesy for a ring-carrierthe troop is past come pilgrim I will bring youwhere you shall host of enjoined penitentstheres four or five to great Saint Jaques boundalready at my houseI humbly thank youplease it this matron and this gentle maidto eat with us to-night the charge and thankingshall be for me and to requite you furtherI will bestow some precepts of this virginworthy the notewell take your offer kindlynay good my lord put him toit let him have his wayif your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no more in your respecton my life my lord a bubbledo you think I am so far deceived in himbelieve it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman hes a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise-breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainmentit were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail youI would I knew in what particular action to try himnone better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to doI with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hood wink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anythingO for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem forit when your lordship sees the bottom of his success init and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not John Drums entertainment your inclining cannot be removed here he comesO for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any handhow now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your dispositiona pox onit let it go itis but a drumbut a drum isit but a drum a drum so lost there was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiersthat was not to be blamed in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that Ceasar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to commandwell we cannot greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recoveredit might have been recoveredit might but it is not nowit is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have that drum or another or hic jacetwhy if you have a stomach toit monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthinessby the hand of a soldier I will undertake itbut you must not now slumber in itiull about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from memay I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about itI know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt I vowI know thourt valiant and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewellI love not many wordsno more than a fish loves water is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to doityou do not know him my lord as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a mans favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever afterwhy do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself untonone in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall to-night for indeed he is not for your lordships respectwell make you some sport with the fox ere we case him he was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very nightI must go look my twigs he shall be caughtyour brother he shall go along with meast please your lordship iull leave younow will I lead you to the house and show youthe lass I spoke ofbut you say shes honestthats all the fault I spoke with her but onceand found her wondrous cold but I sent to herby this same coxcomb that we have inthe windtokens and letters which she did re-sendand this is all I have done Shes a fair creaturewill you go see herwith all my heart my lordif you misdoubt me that I am not sheI know not how I shall assure you furtherbut I shall lose the grounds I work uponthough my estate be falln I was well bornnothing acquainted with these businessesand would not put my reputation nowin any staining actnor would I wish youfirst give me trust the county is my husbandand what to your sworn counsel I have spokenis so from word to word and then you cannotby the good aid that I of you shall borrowerr in bestowing itI should believe youfor you have showed me that which well approvesyoure great in fortunetake this purse of goldand let me buy your friendly help thus farwhich I will over-pay and pay againwhen I have found it the county woos your daughterlays down his wanton siege before her beautyresolved to carry her let her in fine consentas well direct her how itis best to bear itnow his important blood will nought denythat shell demand a ring the county wearsthat down ward hath succeeded in his housefrom son to son some four or five descentssince the first father wore it this ring he holdsin most rich choice yet in his idle fireto buy his will it would not seem too dearhoweer repented afternow I seethe bottom of your purposeyou see it lawful then it is no morebut that your daughter ere she seems as wondesires this ring appoints him an encounterin fine delivers me to fill the timeherself most chastely absent after thisto marry her iull add three thousand crownsto what is past alreadyI have yieldedinstruct my daughter how she shall perseverthat time and place with this deceit so lawfulmay prove coherent every night he comeswith musics of all sorts and songs composedto her unworthiness it nothing steads usto chide him from our eaves for he persistsas if his life lay onitwhy then to-nightlet us assay our plot which if it speedis wicked meaning in a lawful deedand lawful meaning in a lawful actwhere both not sin and yet a sinful factbut lets about ithe can come no other way but by this hedge-corner when you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpretergood captain let me be the interpreterart not acquainted with him knows he not thy voiceno sir I warrant youbut what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us againeven such as you speak to mehe must think us some band of strangers inthe adversarys entertainment now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs language gabble enough and good enough as for you interpreter you must seem very politic but couch ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forgesten oclock within these three hours itwill be time enough to go home what shall I say I have done it must be a very plausive invention that carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door I find my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my tonguethis is the first truth that eer thine own tongue was guilty ofwhat the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit yet slight ones will not carry it they will say Came you off with so little and great ones I dare not give wherefore whats the instance tongue I must put you into a butter-womans mouth and buy myself another of Bajazets mute if you prattle me into these perilsis it possible he should know what he is and be that he isI would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish swordwe cannot afford you soor the baring of my beard and to say it was in stratagemtwould not door to drown my clothes and say I was strippedhardly servethough I swore I leaped from the window of the tadelhow deepthirty fathomthree great oaths would scarce make that be believedI would I had any drum of the enemysI would swear I recovered itthou shalt hear one anona drum now of the enemysthroca movousus cargo

keep him muffledtill we do hear from themcaptain I willa will betray us all unto ourselvesinform on thatso I will sirtill then iull keep him dark and safely lockedthey told me that your name was Fontibellno my good lord Dianatitled goddessand worth it with addition but fair soulin your fine frame hath love no qualityif the quick fire of youth light not your mindyou are no maiden but a monumentwhen you are dead you should be such a oneas you are now for you are cold and sternand now you should be as your mother waswhen your sweet self was gotshe then was honestso should you benomy mother did but duty such my lordas you owe to your wifeno more o thatI prithee do not strive against my vowsI was compelled to her but I love theeby loves own sweet constraint and will for everdo thee all rights of serviceay so you serve ustill we serve you but when you have our rosesyou barely leave our thorns to prick ourselvesand mock us with our barenesshow have I swornitis not the many oaths that make the truthbut the plain single vow that is vowed truewhat is not holy that we swear not bybut take the highest to witness then pray you tell meif I should swear by Gods great attributesI loved you dearly would you believe my oathswhen I did love you ill this has no holdingto swear by him whom I protest to lovethat I will work against him therefore your oathsare words and poor conditions but unsealedat least in my opinionchange it change itbe not so holy-cruel love is holyand my integrity neer knew the craftsthat you do charge men with Stand no more offbut give thyself unto my sick desireswho then recover say thou art mine and evermy love as it begins shall so perseverI see that men make ropes in such a scarrthat well forsake ourselves give me that ringiull lend it thee my dear but have no powerto give it from mewill you not my lordit is an honour longing to our housebequeathed down from many ancestorswhich were the greatest obloquy inthe worldin me to losemine honours such a ringmy chastitys the jewel of our housebequeathed down from many ancestorswhich were the greatest obloquy inthe worldin me to lose thus your own proper wisdombrings in the champion honour on my partagainst your vain assaulthere take my ringmy house mine honour yea my life be thineand iull be bid by theewhen midnight comes knock at my chamber-windowiull order take my mother shall not hearnow will I charge you in the band of truthwhen you have conquered my yet maiden bedremain there but an hour nor speak to memy reasons are most strong and you shall know themwhen back again this ring shall be deliveredand on your finger in the night iull putanother ring that what in time proceedsmay token to the future our past deedsadieu till then then fail not you have wona wife of me though there my hope be donea heaven on earth I have won by wooing theefor which live long to thank both heaven and meyou may so in the endmy mother told me just how he would wooas if she sat in s heart she says all menhave the like oaths he had sworn to marry mewhen his wifes dead therefore iull lie with himwhen I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braidmarry that will I live and die a maidonly in this disguise I thinkt no sinto cozen him that would unjustly winyou have not given him his mothers letterI have delivered it an hour since there is something init that stings his nature for on the reading it he changed almost into another manhe has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a ladyespeally he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with youwhen you have spoken it itis dead and I am the grave of ithe hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste compositionnow God delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are wemerely our own traitors and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream oerflows himselfis it not most damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents we shall not then have his company to-nightnot till after midnight for he is dieted to his hourthat approaches apace I would gladly have him see his company anatomized that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeitwe will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the otherin the meantime what near you of these warsI hear there is an overture of peacenay I assure you a peace concludedwhat will Count Rousillon do then will he travel higher or return again into FranceI perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his counsellet it be forbid sir so should I be a great deal of his actsir his wife some two months since fled from his house her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heavenhow is this justifiedthe stronger part of it by her own letters which make her story true even to the point of her death her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the placehath the count all this intelligenceay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verityI am heartily sorry that hell be glad of thishow mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our lossesand how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as amplethe web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtueshow now wheres your masterhe met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave his lordship will next morning for France the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the kingthey shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commendthey cannot be too sweet for the kings tartness heres his lordship nowhow now my lord isit not after midnightI have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses a months length a-piece by an abstract of success I have congeed with the duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my lady mother I am returning entertained my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs the last was the greatest but that I have not ended yetif the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordshipI mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier come bring forth this counterfeit model he has deceived me like a double-meaning prophesierbring him forthhas sat inthe stocks all night poor gallant knaveno matter his heels have deserved it in usurping his spurs so long how does he carry himselfI have told your lordship already the stocks carry him but to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting inthe stocks and what think you he hath confessednothing of me has ahis confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be init as I believe you are you must have the patience to hear ita plague upon him muffled he can say nothing of me hush hushhoodman comes Porto tartarossahe calls for the tortures what will you say without emI will confess what I know without constraint if ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no morebosko chimurchoboblibindo chicurmurcoyou are a merful general our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a noteand truly as I hope to livefirst demand of him how many horse the duke is strong what say you to thatfive or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable the troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to liveshall I set down your answer sodo iull take the sacrament onit how and which way you willalls one to him what a past-saving slave is thisyou are deceived my lord this is Monsieur Parolles the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the chape of his daggerI will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatlywell thats set downfive or six thousand horse I said I will say true or thereabouts set down for iull speak truthhes very near the truth in thisbut I con him no thanks forit in the nature he delivers itpoor rogues I pray you saywell thats set downI humbly thank you sir a truths a truth the rogues are marvellous poordemand of him of what strength they are a-foot what say you to thatby my troth sir if I were to live this present hour I will tell true let me see Spurio a hundred and fifty Sebastian so many Corambus so many Jaques so many Guiltian Cosmo Lodowick and Grati I two hundred fifty each mine own company Chitopher Vaumond BentiI two hundred fifty each so that the muster-file rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieceswhat shall be done to himnothing but let him have thanks Demand of him my condition and what credit I have with the dukewell thats set down you shall demand of him whether one captain Dumain be inthe camp a Frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty and expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt what say you to this what do you know of itI beseech you let me answer to the particular of the intergatories demand them singlydo you know this captain DumainI know him a was a botchers prentice in Paris from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieves fool with child a dumb innocent that could not say him naynay by your leave hold your hands though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that fallswell is this captain in the duke of Florences campupon my knowledge he is and lousynay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anonwhat is his reputation with the dukethe duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out ofthe

proper maid in Florence one Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up againnay iull read it first by your favourmy meaning init I protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lasvious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it findsdamnable both-sides roguewhen he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take itafter he scores he never pays the scorehalf won is match well made match and well make ithe neer pays after-debts take it beforeand say a soldier Dian told thee thismen are to mell with boys are not to kissfor count of this the counts a fool I know itwho pays before but not when he does owe itthine as he vowed to thee in thine earhe shall be whipped through the army with this rime ins foreheadthis is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldierI could endure anything before but a cat and now hes a cat to meI perceive sir by our generals looks we shall be fain to hang youmy life sir in any case not that I am afraid to die but that my offences being many I would repent out the remainder of nature let me live sir in a dungeon inthe stocks or anywhere so I may livewell see what may be done so you confess freely therefore once more to this captain Dumain you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honestyhe will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he is stronger than Hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine-drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bed-clothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have but little more to say sir of his honesty he has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothingI begin to love him for thisfor this description of thine honesty a pox upon him for me he is more and more a catwhat say you to his expertness in warfaith sir he has led the drum before the English tragedians to belie him I will not and more of his soldiership I know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the doubling of files I would do the man what honour I can but of this I am not certainhe hath out-villained villany so far that the rarity redeems hima pox on him hes a cat stillhis qualities being at this poor price I need not ask you if gold will corrupt him to revoltsir for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetuallywhats his brother the other captain Dumainwhy does he ask him or mewhats heeen a crow ofthe same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is in a retreat he out-runs any lackey

pleasureiull no more drumming a plague of all drums Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lasvious young boy the count have I run into this danger yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was takenthere is no remedy sir but you must die the general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die come headsman off with his headO lord sir let me live or let me see my deaththat shall you and take your leave of all

a metaphorindeed sir if your metaphor stink I will stop my nose or against any mans metaphor Prithee get thee furtherpray you sir deliver me this paperfoh prithee stand away a paper from fortunes

lordshipmy lord I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratchedand what would you have me to do itis too late to pare her nails now wherein have you played the knave with fortune that she should

I had talk of you last night though you are a fool and a knave you shall eat go to followI praise God for youwe lost a jewel of her and our esteemwas made much poorer by it but your sonas mad in folly lacked the sense to knowher estimation homeitis past my liegeand I beseech your majesty to make itnatural rebellion done inthe blaze of youthwhen oil and fire too strong for reasons forceoerbears it and burns onmy honoured ladyI have forgiven and forgotten allthough my revenges were high bent upon himand watched the time to shootthis I must saybut first I beg my pardon the young lorddid to his majesty his mother and his ladyoffence of mighty note but to himselfthe greatest wrong of all he lost a wifewhose beauty did astonish the surveyof richest eyes whose words all ears took captivewhose dear perfection hearts that scorned to servehumbly called mistresspraising what is lostmakes the remembrance dear well call him hitherwe are reconled and the first view shall killall repetition let him not ask our pardonthe nature of his great offence is deadand deeper than oblivion we do burythe incensing relics of it let him approacha stranger no offender and inform himso itis our will he shouldI shall my liegewhat says he to your daughter have you spokeall that he is hath reference to your highnessthen shall we have a match I have letters sent methat set him high in famehe looks well onitI am not a day of seasonfor thou mayst see a sunshine and a hailin me at once but to the brightest beamsdistracted clouds give way so stand thou forththe time is fair againmy high-repented blamesdear sovereign pardon to meall is wholenot one word more of the consumed timelets take the instant by the forward topfor we are old and on our quickest decreesthe inaudible and noiseless foot of timesteals ere we can effect them you rememberthe daughter of this lordadmiringly my liegeat first I stuck my choice upon her ere my heartdurst make too bold a herald of my tonguewhere the impression of mine eye infixingcontempt his scornful perspective did lend mewhich warped the line of every other favourscorned a fair colour or expressed it stolenextended or contracted all proportionsto a most hideous object thence it camethat she whom all men praised and whom myselfsince I have lost have loved was in mine eyethe dust that did offend itwell excusedthat thou didst love her strikes some scores awayfrom the great compt but love that comes too latelike a remorseful pardon slowly carriedto the great sender turns a sour offencecrying thats good thats gone our rasher faultsmake trivial price of serious things we havenot knowing them until we know their graveoft our displeasures to ourselves unjustdestroy our friends and after weep their dustour own love waking cries to see whats donewhile shameful hate sleeps out the afternoonbe this sweet Helens knell and now forget hersend forth your amorous token for fair Maudlinthe main consents are had and here well stayto see our widowers second marriage-daywhich better than the first O dear heaven blessor ere they meet in me O nature cessecome on my son in whom my houses namemust be digested give a favour from youto sparkle in the spirits of my daughterthat she may quickly comeand every hair thats onit Helen thats deadwas a sweet creature such a ring as thisthe last that eer I took her leave at courtI saw upon her fingerhers it was notnow pray you let me see it for mine eyewhile I was speaking oft was fastened

are deceived my lord she never saw itin Florence was it from a casement thrown mewrapped in a paper which contained the nameof her that threw it noble she was and thoughtI stood engaged but when I had subscribedto mine own fortune and informed her fullyI could not answer in that course of honouras she had made the overture she ceasedin heavy satisfaction and would neverreceive the ring againplutus himselfthat knows the tinct and multiplying medinehath not in natures mystery more sencethan I have in this ring itwas mine itwas Helenswhoever gave it you then if you knowthat you are well acquainted with yourselfconfess itwas hers and by what rough enforcementyou got it from her she called the saints to suretythat she would never put it from her fingerunless she gave it to yourself in bedwhere you have never come or sent it usupon her great disastershe never saw itthou speakest it falsely as I love mine honourand makest conjectural fears to come into mewhich I would fain shut out if it should provethat thou art so inhuman itwill not prove soand yet I know not thou didst hate her deadlyand she is dead which nothing but to closeher eyes myself could win me to believemore than to see this ring take him awaymy fore-past proofs howeer the matter fallshall tax my fears of little vanityhaving vainly feared too little away with himwell sift this matter furtherif you shall provethis ring was ever hers you shall as easyprove that I husbanded her bed in Florencewhere yet she never wasI am wrapped in dismal thinkingsgracious sovereignwhether I have been to blame or no I know notheres a petition from a Florentinewho hath for four or five removes come shortto tender it herself I undertook itvanquished thereto by the fair grace and speechof the poor suppliant who by this I knowis here attending her business looks in herwith an importing visage and she told mein a sweet verbal brief it did concernyour highness with herself"upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won me now is the Count Rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honours paid to him he stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow him to his country for justice grant it me O king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone Diana Capilet "I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair and toll for this iull none of himthe heavens have thought well on thee Lafeuto bring forth this discovery Seek these suitorsgo speedily and bring again the countI am afeard the life of Helen ladywas foully snatchednow justice on the doersI wonder sir sith wives are monsters to youand that you fly them as you swear them lordshipyet you desire to marrywhat womans thatI am my lord a wretched Florentinederived from the anent Capiletmy suit as I do understand you knowand therefore know how far I may be pitiedI am her mother sir whose age and honourboth suffer under this complaint we bringand both shall cease without your remedycome hither county do you know these womenmy lord I neither can nor will denybut that I know them do they charge me furtherwhy do you look so strange upon your wifeshes none of mine my lordif you shall marryyou give away this hand and that is mineyou give away heavens vows and those are mineyou give away myself which is known minefor I by vow am so embodied yoursthat she which marries you must marry meeither both or noneyour reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband for hermy lord this is a fond and desperate creaturewhom sometime I have laughed with let your highnesslay a more noble thought upon mine honourthan for to think that I would sink it heresir for my thoughts you have them ill to friendtill your deeds gain them fairer prove your honourthan in my thought it liesgood my lordask him upon his oath if he does thinkhe had not my virginitywhat sayst thou to hershes impudent my lordand was a common gamester to the camphe does me wrong my lord if I were sohe might have bought me at a common pricedo not believe him O behold this ringwhose high respect and rich validitydid lack a parallel yet for all thathe gave it to a commoner ofthe campif I be onehe blushes and itis itof six preceding ancestors that gemconferred by testament to the sequent issuehath it been owed and worn this is his wifethat rings a thousand proofsmethought you saidyou saw one here in court could witness itI did my lord but loath am to produceso bad an instrument his names ParollesI saw the man to-day if man he befind him and bring him hitherwhat of himhes quoted for a most perfidious slavewith all the spots of the world taxed and deboshedwhose nature sickens but to speak a trutham I or that or this for what hell utterthat will speak anythingshe hath that ring of yoursI think she has certain it is I liked herand boarded her inthe wanton way of youthshe knew her distance and did angle for memadding my eagerness with her restraintas all impediments in fancys courseare motives of more fancy and in fineher infinite cunning with her modern gracesubdued me to her rate she got the ringand I had that which any inferior mightat market-price have boughtI must be patientyou that have turned off a first so noble wifemay justly diet me I pray you yetsince you lack virtue I will lose a husbandsend for your ring I will return it homeand give me mine againI have it notwhat ring was yours I pray yousir much likethe same upon your fingerknow you this ring this ring was his of lateand this was it I gave him being a-bedthe story then goes false you threw it himout of a casementI have spoke the truthmy lord I do confess the ring was hersyou boggle shrewdly every feather starts youis this the man you speak ofay my lordtell me sirrah but tell me true I charge younot fearing the displeasure of your masterwhich on your just proceeding iull keep offby him and by this woman here what know youso please your majesty my master hath been an honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen havecome come to the purpose did he love this womanfaith sir he did love her but howhow I pray youhe did love her sir as a gentleman loves a womanhow is thathe loved her sir and loved her notas thou art a knave and no knavewhat an equivocal companion is thisI am a poor man and at your majestys commandhe is a good drum my lord but a naughty oratordo you know he promised me marriagefaith I know more than iull speakbut wilt thou not speak all thou knowestyes so please your majesty I did go between them as I said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talked of Satan and of limbo and of furies and I know not what yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore I will not speak what I knowthou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside this ring you say was yoursay my good lordwhere did you buy it or who gave it youit was not given me nor I did not buy itwho lent it youit was not lent me neitherwhere did you find it thenI found it notif it were yours by none of all these wayshow could you give it himI never gave it himthis womans an easy glove my lord she goes off and on at pleasurethis ring was mine I gave it his first wifeit might be yours or hers for aught I knowtake her away I do not like her nowto prison with her and away with himunless thou tellest me where thou hadst this ringthou diest within this houriull never tell youtake her awayiull put in bail my liegeI think thee now some common customerby Jove if ever I knew man itwas youwherefore hast thou accused him all this whilebecause hes guilty and he is not guiltyhe knows I am no maid and hell swear toitiull swear I am a maid and he knows notgreat king I am no strumpet by my lifeI am either maid or else this old mans wifeshe does abuse our ears to prison with hergood mother fetch my bailstay royal sirthe jeweller that owes the ring is sent forand he shall surety me but for this lordwho hath abused me as he knows himselfthough yet he never harmed me here I quit himhe knows himself my bed he hath defiledand at that time he got his wife with childdead though she be she feels her young one kickso theres my riddle one thats dead is quickand now behold the meaningis there no exorstbeguiles the truer office of mine eyesisit real that I seeno my good lorditis but the shadow of a wife you seethe name and not the thingboth both O pardonO my good lord when I was like this maidI found you wondrous kind there is your ringand look you heres your letter this

heartsas I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayest charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness my brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education this is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid ityonder comes my master your brothergo apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me upnow sir what make you herenothing I am not taught to make anythingwhat mar you then sirmarry sir I

accordlet me go I sayI will not till I please you shall hear me my father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities the spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exerses as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunesand what wilt thou do beg when that is spent well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you you shall have some part of your will I pray you leave meI will no further offend you than becomes me for my goodget you with him you old dogis old dog my reward most true I have lost my teeth in your service God be with my old master he

at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they dowhere will the old duke livethey say he is already in the forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden worldwhat you wrestle

against me to try a fall to-morrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my willcharles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute iull tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger and thou wert best look toit for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villanous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonderI am heartily glad I came hither to you if he come to-morrow iull give him his payment if ever he go alone again iull never wrestle for prize more and so God keep your worshipfarewell good Charles now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soul yet I know not why hates nothing more than he yet hes gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and espeally of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprised but it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now iull go aboutI pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merrydear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasureherein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to theewell I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yoursyou know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection by mine honour I will and when I break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merryfrom henceforth I will coz and devise sports let me see what think you of falling in lovemarry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off againwhat shall be our sport thenlet us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equallyI would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to womenitis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredlynay now thou goest from fortunes office to natures fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of natureno when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argumentindeed there is fortune too hard for nature when fortune makes natures natural the cutter-off of natures witperadventure this is not fortunes work neither but natures who perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now wit whither wander youmistress you must come away to your fatherwere you made the messengerno by mine honour but I was bid to come for youwhere learned you that oath foolof a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught now iull stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forswornhow prove you that in the great heap of your knowledgeay marry now unmuzzle your wisdomstand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knaveby our beards if we had them thou artby my knavery if I had it then I were but if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustardprithee who isit that thou meanestone that old Frederick your father lovesmy fathers love is enough to honour him Enough speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation one of these daysthe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishlyby my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show here comes Monsieur Le Beauwith his mouth full of newswhich he will put on us as pigeons feed their youngthen we shall be news-crammedall the better we shall be more marketablebon jour Monsieur Le Beau whats the newsfair princess you have lost much good sportsport of what colourwhat colour madam how shallI answer youas wit and fortune willor as the Destinies decreewell said that was laid on with a trowelnay if I keep not my rankthou losest thy old smellyou amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight ofyet tell us the manner of the wrestlingI will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform itwell the beginning that is dead and buriedthere comes an old man and his three sonsI could match this beginning with an old talethree proper young men of excellent growth and presencewith bills on their necks be it known unto all men by these presents the eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him so he served the second and so the third yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weepingalasbut what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lostwhy this that I speak ofthus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladiesor I I promise theebut is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking Shall we see this wrestling cousinyou must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform ityonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see itcome on since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardnessis yonder the maneven he madamalas he is too young yet he looks successfullyhow now daughter and cousin are you crept hither to see the wrestlingay my liege so please you give us leaveyou will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man in pity of the challengers youth I would fam dissuade him but he will not be entreated speak to him ladies see if you can move himcall him hither good Monsieur le Beaudo so iull not be bymonsieur the challenger the princes call for youI attend them with all respect and dutyyoung man have you challenged Charles the wrestlerno fair princess he is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youthyoung gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years you have seen cruel proof of this mans strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attemptdo young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forwardI beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it emptythe little strength that I have I would it were with youand mine to eke out hersfare you well pray heaven I be deceived in youyour hearts desires be with youcome where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earthready sir but his will hath in it a more modest workingyou shall try but one fallno I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a firstyou mean to mock me after you should not have mocked me before but come your waysnow Hercules be thy speed young manI would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the legO excellent young manif I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should downno more no moreyes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathedhow dost thou Charleshe cannot speak my lordbear him away what is thy name young manorlando my liege the youngest son of sir Rowland de BoysI would thou hadst been son to some man elsethe world esteemed thy father honourablebut I did find him still mine enemythou shouldst have better pleased me with this deedhadst thou descended from another housebut fare thee well thou art a gallant youthI would thou hadst told me of another fatherwere I my father coz would I do thisI am more proud to be sir Rowlands sonhis youngest son and would not change that callingto be adopted heir to Frederickmy father loved sir Rowland as his souland all the world was of my fathers mindhad I before known this young man his sonI should have given him tears unto entreatiesere he should thus have venturedgentle cousinlet us go thank him and encourage himmy fathers rough and envious dispositionsticks me at heart sir you have well deservedif you do keep your promises in lovebut justly as you have exceeded all promiseyour mistress shall be happygentlemanwear this for me one out of suits with fortunethat could give more but that her hand lacks meansshall we go cozay fare you well fair gentlemancan I not say I thank you my better partsare all thrown down and that which here stands upis but a quintain a mere lifeless blockhe calls us back my pride fell with my fortunesiull ask him what he would did you call sirsir you have wrestled well and overthrownmore than your enemieswill you go cozhave with you fare you wellwhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongueI cannot speak to her yet she urged conferenceO poor Orlando thou art overthrownor Charles or something weaker masters theegood sir I do in friendship counsel youto leave this place Albeit you have deservedhigh commendation true applause and loveyet such is now the dukes conditionthat he misconstrues all that you have donethe duke is humorous what he is indeedmore suits you to conceive than I to speak ofI thank you sir and pray you tell me thiswhich of the two was daughter of the dukethat here was at the wrestlingneither his daughter if we judge by mannersbut yet indeed the smaller is his daughterthe other is daughter to the banished dukeand here detained by her usurping uncleto keep his daughter company whose lovesare dearer than the natural bond of sistersbut I can tell you that of late this dukehath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niecegrounded upon no other argumentbut that the people praise her for her virtuesand pity her for her good fathers sakeand on my life his malice gainst the ladywill suddenly break forth sir fare you wellhereafter in a better world than thisI shall desire more love and knowledge of youI rest much bounden to you fare you wellthus must I from the smoke into the smotherfrom tyrant duke unto a tyrant brotherbut heavenly Rosalindwhy cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy not a wordnot one to throw at a dogno thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasonsthen there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without anybut is all this for your fatherno some of it is for my childs fatherO how full of briers is this working-day worldthey are but burrs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch themI could shake them off my coat these burrs are in my hearthem them awayI would try if I could cry hem and have himcome come wrestle with thy affectionsO they take the part of a better wrestler than myselfO a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of a fall but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir Rowlands youngest sonthe duke my father loved his father dearlydoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly by this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not Orlandono faith hate him not for my sakewhy should I not doth he not deserve welllet me love him for that and do you love him because I do look here comes the dukewith his eyes full of angermistress dispatch you with your safest hasteand get you from our courtme uncleyou cousinwithin these ten days if that thou beest foundso near our public court as twenty milesthou diest for itI do beseech your gracelet me the knowledge of my fault bear with meif with myself I hold intelligenceor have acquaintance with mine own desiresif that I do not dream or be not franticas I do trust I am not then dear unclenever so much as in a thought unborndid I offend your highnessthus do all traitorsif their purgation did consist in wordsthey are as innocent as grace itselflet it suffice thee that I trust thee notyet your mistrust cannot make me a traitortell me whereon the likelihood dependsthou art thy fathers daughter theres enoughso was I when your highness took his dukedomso was I when your highness banished himtreason is not inherited my lordor if we did derive it from our friendswhats that to me my father was no traitorthen good my liege mistake me not so muchto think my poverty is treacherousdear sovereign hear me speakay Celia we stayed her for your sakeelse had she with her father ranged alongI did not then entreat to have her stayit was your pleasure and your own remorseI was too young that time to value herbut now I know her if she be a traitorwhy so am I we still have slept togetherrose at an instant learned played eat togetherand wheresoeer we went like Junos swansstill we went coupled and inseparableshe is too subtle for thee and her smoothnessher very silence and her patiencespeak to the people and they pity herthou art a fool she robs thee of thy nameand thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuouswhen she is gone then open not thy lipsfirm and irrevocable is my doomwhich I have passed upon her she is banishedpronounce that sentence then on me my liegeI cannot live out of her companyyou are a fool you niece provide yourselfif you outstay the time upon mine honourand in the greatness of my word you dieO my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou gowilt thou change fathers I will give thee mineI charge thee be not thou more grieved than I amI have more causethou hast not cousinprithee be cheerful knowest thou not the dukehath banished me his daughterthat he hath notno hath not Rosalind lacks then the lovewhich teacheth thee that thou and I am oneshall we be sundered shall we part sweet girlno let my father seek another heirtherefore devise with me how we may flywhither to go and what to bear with usand do not seek to take your change upon youto bear your griefs yourself and leave me outfor by this heaven now at our sorrows palesay what thou canst iull go along with theewhy whither shall we goto seek my uncle in the forest of Ardenalas what danger will it be to usmaids as we are to travel forth so farbeauty provoketh thieves sooner than goldiull put myself in poor and mean attireand with a kind of umber smirch my facethe like do you so shall we pass alongand never stir assailantswere it not betterbecause that I am more than common tallthat I did suit me all points like a mana gallant curtle-axe upon my thigha boar-spear in my hand and in my heartlie there what hidden womans fear there willwell have a swashing and a martial outsideas many other mannish cowards havethat do outface it with their semblanceswhat shall I call thee when thou art a maniull have no worse a name than Joves own pageand therefore look you call me ganymedebut what will you be calledsomething that hath a reference to my stateno longer Celia but Alienabut cousin what if we assayed to stealthe clownish fool out of your fathers courtwould he not be a comfort to our travelhell go along oer the wide world with meleave me alone to woo him lets awayand get our jewels and our wealth togetherdevise the fittest time and safest wayto hide us from pursuit that will be madeafter my flight now go we in contentto liberty and not to banishmentnow my co-mates and brothers in exilehath not old custom made this life more sweetthan that of painted pomp are not these woodsmore free from peril than the envious courthere feel we but the penalty of Adamthe seasons difference as the icy fangand churlish chiding of the winters windwhich when it bites and blows upon my bodyeven till I shrink with cold I smile and saythis is no flattery these are counsellorsthat feelingly persuade me what I am sweet are the uses of adversitywhich like the toad ugly and venomouswears yet a precious jewel in his headand this our life exempt from public hauntfinds tongues in trees books in the running brookssermons in stones and good in every thingI would not change ithappy is your gracethat can translate the stubbornness of fortuneinto so quiet and so sweet a stylecome shall we go and kill us venisonand yet it irks me the poor dappled foolsbeing native burghers of this desert tyshould in their own confines with forked headshave their round haunches goredindeed my lordthe melancholy Jaques grieves at thatand in that kind swears you do more usurpthan doth your brother that hath banished youto-day my lord of Amiens and myselfdid steal behind him as he lay alongunder an oak whose antique root peeps outupon the brook that brawls along this woodto the which place a poor sequestered stagthat from the hunters aim had taen a hurtdid come to languish and indeed my lordthe wretched animal heaved forth such groansthat their discharge did stretch his leathern coatalmost to bursting and the big round tearscoursed one another down his innocent nosein piteous chase and thus the hairy foolmuch marked of the melancholy Jaquesstood on the extremest verge of the swift brookaugmenting it with tearsbut what said Jaquesdid he not moralize this spectacleO yes into a thousand similesfirst for his weeping into the needless streampoor deer quoth he thou makest a testamentas worldlings do giving thy sum of moreto that which had too much then being there aloneleft and abandoned of his velvet friendsitis right quoth he thus misery doth partthe flux of company anon a careless herdfull of the pasture jumps along by himand never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaquessweep on you fat and greasy tizensitis just the fashion wherefore do you lookupon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierceth throughthe body of the country ty courtyea and of this our life swearing that weare mere usurpers tyrants and whats worseto fright the animals and to kill them upin their assigned and native dwelling-placeand did you leave him in this contemplationwe did my lord weeping and commentingupon the sobbing deershow me the placeI love to cope him in these sullen fitsfor then hes full of matteriull bring you to him straightcan it be possible that no man saw themit cannot be some villains of my courtare of consent and sufferance in thisI cannot hear of any that did see herthe ladies her attendants of her chambersaw her a-bed and in the morning earlythey found the bed untreasured of their mistressmy lord the roynish clown at whom so oftyour grace was wont to laugh is also missinghisperia the princess gentlewomanconfesses that she secretly oerheardyour daughter and her cousin much commendthe parts and graces of the wrestlerthat did but lately foil the sinewy Charlesand she believes wherever they are gonethat youth is surely in their companysend to his brother fetch that gallant hitherif he be absent bring his brother to meiull make him find him do this suddenlyand let not search and inquisition quailto bring again these foolish runawayswhos therewhat my young master O my gentle masterO my sweet master O you memoryof old sir Rowland why what make you herewhy are you virtuous why do people love youand wherefore are you gentle strong and valiantwhy would you be so fond to overcomethe bony priser of the humorous dukeyour praise is come too swiftly home before youknow you not master to some kind of mentheir graces serve them but as enemiesno more do yours your virtues gentle masterare sanctified and holy traitors to youO what a world is this when what is comelyenvenoms him that bears itwhy whats the matterO unhappy youthcome not within these doors within this roofthe enemy of all your graces livesyour brother no no brother yet the sonyet not the son I will not call him sonof him I was about to call his fatherhath heard your praises and this night he meansto burn the lodging where you use to lieand you within it if he fail of thathe will have other means to cut you offI overheard him and his practicesthis is no place this house is but a butcheryabhor it fear it do not enter itwhy whither Adam wouldst thou have me gono matter whither so you come not herewhat wouldst thou have me go and beg my foodor with a base and boisterous sword enforcea thievish living on the common roadthis I must do or know not what to doyet this I will not do do how I canI rather will subject me to the maliceof a diverted blood and bloody brotherbut do not so I have five hundred crownsthe thrifty hire I saved under your fatherwhich I did store to be my foster-nursewhen service should in my old limbs lie lameand unregarded age in corners throwntake that and he that doth the ravens feedyea providently caters for the sparrowbe comfort to my age here is the goldall this I give you let me be your servantthough I look old yet I am strong and lustyfor in my youth I never did applyhot and rebellious liquors in my bloodnor did not with unbashful forehead woothe means of weakness and debilitytherefore my age is as a lusty winterfrosty but kindly let me go with youiull do the service of a younger manin all your business and necessitiesO good old man how well in thee appearsthe constant service of the antique worldwhen service sweat for duty not for meedthou art not for the fashion of these timeswhere none will sweat but for promotionand having that do choke their service upeven with the having it is not so with theebut poor old man thou prunest a rotten treethat cannot so much as a blossom yieldin lieu of all thy pains and husbandrybut come thy ways well go along togetherand ere we have thy youthful wages spentwell light upon some settled low contentmaster go on and I will follow theeto the last gasp with truth and loyaltyfrom seventeen years till now almost fourscorehere lived I but now live here no moreat seventeen years many their fortunes seekbut at fourscore it is too late a weekyet fortune cannot recompense me betterthan to die well and not my masters debtorO Jupiter how weary are my spiritsI care not for my spirits if my legs were not wearyI could find it in my heart to disgrace my mans apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage good AlienaI pray you bear with me I cannot go no furtherfor my part I had rather bear with you than bear you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you for I think you have no money in your pursewell this is the forest of Ardenay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was at home I was in a better place but travellers must be contentay be so good Touchstone look you who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talkthat is the way to make her scorn you stillO Corin that thou knewest how I do love herI partly guess for I have loved ere nowno Corin being old thou canst not guessthough in thy youth thou wast as true a loveras ever sighed upon a midnight pillowbut if thy love were ever like to mineas sure I think did never man love sohow many actions most ridiculoushast thou been drawn to by thy fantasyinto a thousand that I have forgottenO thou didst then neer love so heartilyif thou rememberest not the slightest follythat ever love did make thee run intothou hast not lovedor if thou hast not sat as I do nowwearing thy hearer with thy mistress praisethou hast not lovedor if thou hast not broke from companyabruptly as my passion now makes methou hast not loved O Phebe Phebe Phebealas poor shepherd searching of thy woundI have by hard adventure found mine ownand I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her batler and the cows dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in follythou speakest wiser than thou art ware ofnay I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against itjove Jove this shepherds passionis much upon my fashionand mine but it grows something stale with meI pray you one of you question yond manif he for gold will give us any foodI faint almost to deathholla you clownpeace fool hes not thy kinsmanwho callsyour betters sirelse are they very wretchedpeace I say Good even to you friendand to you gentle sir and to you allI prithee shepherd if that love or goldcan in this desert place buy entertainmentbring us where we may rest ourselves and feedheres a young maid with travel much oppressedand faints for succourfair sir I pity herand wish for her sake more than for mine ownmy fortunes were more able to relieve herbut I am shepherd to another manand do not shear the fleeces that I grazemy master is of churlish dispositionand little recks to find the way to heavenby doing deeds of hospitalitybesides his cote his flocks and bounds of feedare now on sale and at our sheepcote nowby reason of his absence there is nothingthat you will feed on but what is come seeand in my voice most welcome shall you bewhat is he that shall buy his flock and pasturethat young swain that you saw here but

educdame itis a Greek invocation to call fools into a rcle iull go sleep if I can if I cannot iull rail against all the first-born of Egyptand iull go seek the duke his banquet is prepareddear master I can go no further O I die for food here lie I down and measure out my grave farewell kind masterwhy how now Adam no greater heart in thee Live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little if this uncouth forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or bring it for food to theeconceit is nearer death than thy powers for my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arms end I will here be with thee presently and if I bring thee not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour well said thou lookest cheerly and iull be with thee quickly yet thou liest in the bleak air come I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert cheerly good AdamI think he be transformed into a beastfor I can nowhere find him like a manmy lord he is but even now gone hencehere was he merry hearing of a songif he compact of jars grow musicalwe shall have shortly discord in the spheresgo seek him tell him I would speak with himhe saves my labour by his own approachwhy how now monsieur what a life is thisthat your poor friends must woo your companywhat you look merrilya fool a fool I met a fool inthe foresta motley fool a miserable worldas I do live by food I met a foolwho laid him down and basked him in the sunand railed on Lady fortune in good termsin good set terms and yet a motley foolgood morrow fool quoth I no sir quoth hecall me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune and then he drew a dial from his pokeand looking on it with lack-lustre eyesays very wisely Itis ten oclockthus may we see quoth he how the world wagsitis but an hour ago since it was nineand after one hour more itwill be elevenand so from hour to hour we ripe and ripeand then from hour to hour we rot and rotand thereby hangs a tale when I did hearthe motley fool thus moral on the timemy lungs began to crow like chanticleerthat fools should be so deep-contemplativeand I did laugh sans intermissionan hour by his dial O noble foola worthy fool Motleys the only wearwhat fool is thisO worthy fool one that hath been a courtierand says if ladies be but young and fairthey have the gift to know it and in his brainwhich is as dry as the remainder biscuitafter a voyage he hath strange places crammedwith observation the which he ventsin mangled forms O that I were a foolI am ambitious for a motley coatthou shalt have oneit is my only suitprovided that you weed your better judgmentsof all opinion that grows rank in themthat I am wise I must have libertywithal as large a charter as the windto blow on whom I please for so fools haveand they that are most galled with my follythey most must laugh and why sir must they sothe why is plain as way to parish churchhe that a fool doth very wisely hitdoth very foolishly although he smartnot to seem senseless of the bob if notthe wise mans folly is anatomizedeven by the squandering glances of the foolinvest me in my motley give me leaveto speak my mind and I will through and throughcleanse the foul body of th infected worldif they will patiently receive my medinefie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst dowhat for a counter would I do but goodmost mischievous foul sin in chiding sinfor thou thyself hast been a libertineas sensual as the brutish sting itselfand all the embossed sores and headed evilsthat thou with licence of free foot hast caughtwouldst thou disgorge into the general worldwhy who cries out on pridethat can therein tax any private partydoth it not flow as hugely as the seatill that the weary very means do ebbwhat woman in the ty do I namewhen that I say the ty-woman bearsthe cost of princes on unworthy shoulderswho can come in and say that I mean herwhen such a one as she such is her neighbouror what is he of basest functionthat says his bravery is not on my costthinking that I mean him but therein suitshis folly to the mettle of my speechthere then how then what then let me see whereinmy tongue hath wronged him if it do him rightthen he hath wronged himself if he be freewhy then my taxing like a wild goose fliesunclaimed of any man but who comes hereforbear and eat no morewhy I have eat none yetnor shalt not till necessity be servedof what kind should this cock come ofart thou thus boldened man by thy distressor else a rude despiser of good mannersthat in vility thou seemest so emptyyou touched my vein at first the thorny pointof bare distress hath taen from me the showof smooth vility yet I am inland bredand know some nurture but forbear I sayhe dies that touches any of this fruittill I and my affairs are answeredan you will not be answered with reasonI must diewhat would you have your gentleness shall forcemore than your force move us to gentlenessI almost die for food and let me have itsit down and feed and welcome to our tablespeak you so gently Pardon me I pray youI thought that all things had been savage hereand therefore put I on the countenanceof stern commandment but whateer you arethat in this desert inaccessibleunder the shade of melancholy boughslose and neglect the creeping hours of timeif ever you have looked on better daysif ever been where bells have knolled to churchif ever sat at any good mans feastif ever from your eyelids wiped a tearand know what itis to pity and be pitiedlet gentleness my strong enforcement bein the which hope I blush and hide my swordtrue is it that we have seen better daysand have with holy bell been knolled to churchand sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyesof drops that sacred pity hath engenderedand therefore sit you down in gentlenessand take upon command what help we havethat to your wanting may be ministeredthen but forbear your food a little whilewhiles like a doe I go to find my fawnand give it food there is an old poor manwho after me hath many a weary steplimped in pure love till he be first sufficedoppressed with two weak evils age and hungerI will not touch a bitgo find him outand we will nothing waste till you returnI thank ye and be blessed for your good comfortthou seest we are not all alone unhappythis wide and universal theatrepresents more woful pageants than the scenewherein we play inall the worlds a stageand all the men and women merely playersthey have their exits and their entrancesand one man in his time plays many partshis acts being seven ages At first the infantmewling and puking in the nurses armsand then the whining school-boy with his satcheland shining morning face creeping like snailunwillingly to school and then the loversighing like furnace with a woful balladmade to his mistress eyebrow then a soldierfull of strange oaths and bearded like the pardjealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrelseeking the bubble reputationeven in the cannons mouth and then the justicein fair round belly with good capon linedwith eyes severe and beard of formal cutfull of wise saws and modern instancesand so he plays his part the sixth age shiftsinto the lean and slippered pantaloonwith spectacles on nose and pouch on sidehis youthful hose well saved a world too widefor his shrunk shank and his big manly voiceturning again toward childish treble pipesand whistles in his sound Last scene of allthat ends this strange eventful historyis second childishness and mere oblivionsans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everythingwelcome Set down your venerable burdenand let him feedI thank you most for himso had you needI scarce can speak to thank you for myselfwelcome fall to I will not trouble youas yet to question you about your fortunesgive us some music and good cousin singblow blow thou winter windthou art not so unkindas mans ingratitudethy tooth is not so keenbecause thou art not

Orlando carve on every treethe fair the chaste and unexpressive sheand how like you this shepherds life master Touchstonetruly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is naught in respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherdno more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindredsuch a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in court shepherdno trulythen thou art damnednay I hopetruly thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg all on one sidefor not being at court your reasonwhy if thou never wast at court thou never sawest good manners if thou never sawest good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous state shepherdnot a whit Touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherdsinstance briefly come instancewhy we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasywhy do not your courtiers hands sweat and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow a better instance I say comebesides our hands are hardyour lips will feel them the sooner shallow again a more sounder instance comeand they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the courtiers hands are perfumed with vetmost shallow man thou worms-meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend vet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherdyou have too courtly a wit for me iull restwilt thou rest damned God help thee shallow man God make insion in thee thou art rawsir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suckthat is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldy ram out of all reasonable match if thou beest not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst scapehere comes young master ganymede my new mistresss brotherfrom the east to western Indno jewel is like Rosalindher worth being mounted on the windthrough all the world bears Rosalindall the pictures fairest linedare but black to Rosalindlet no face be kept

Rosalindsweetest nut hath sourest rindsuch a nut is Rosalindhe that sweetest rose will findmust find loves prick and Rosalindthis is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with thempeace you dull fool I found them on a treetruly the tree yields bad fruitiull graff it with you and then I shall graff it with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit inthe country for youll be rotten ere you be half ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlaryou have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judgepeacehere comes my sister reading stand asidewhy should this a desert befor it is unpeopled notongues iull hang on every treethat shall vile sayings showsome how brief the life of manruns his erring pilgrimagethat the stretching of a spanbuckles in his

every spriteheaven would in little showtherefore Heaven nature chargedthat one body should be filledwith all graces wide enlargednature presently distilledhelens cheek but not her heartcleopatras majestyatalantas better partsad Lucretias modestythus Rosalind of many partsby heavenly synod was devisedof many faces eyes and heartsto have the touches dearest prizedheaven would that she these gifts should haveand I to live and die her slaveO most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried have patience good people how now back friends Shepherd go off a little go with him sirrahcome shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippagedidst thou hear these versesO yes I heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bearthats no matter the feet might bear the versesay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the versebut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these treesI was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what I found on a palm-tree I was never so be-rimed since Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I can hardly remembertrow you who hath done thisis it a manand a chain that you once wore about his neck Change you colourI prithee whoO lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounternay but who is itis it possiblenay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it isO wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whoopinggood my complexion dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in my disposition one inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidingsso you may put a man in your bellyis he of Gods making what manner of man is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beardnay he hath but a little beardwhy God will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chinit is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instantnay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maidinfaith coz itis heorlandoorlandoalas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose what did he when thou sawest him what said he how looked he wherein went he what makes he here did he ask for me where remains he how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again Answer me in one wordyou must borrow me gargantuas mouth first itis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechismbut doth he know that I am in this forest and in mans apparel looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestledit is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a dropped acornit may well be called Joves tree when it drops forth such fruitgive me audience good madamproceedthere lay he stretched along like a wounded knightthough it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the groundcry holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets unseasonably he was furnished like a hunterO ominous he comes to kill my heartI would sing my song without a burthen thou bringest me out of tunedo you not know I am a woman when I think I must speak sweet say onyou bring me out Soft comes he not hereitis he slink by and note himI thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself aloneand so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too for your societygod be wityou lets meet as little as we canI do desire we may be better strangersI pray you mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barksI pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredlyrosalind is your loves nameyes justI do not like her namethere was no thought of pleasing you when she was christenedwhat stature is she ofjust as high as my heartyou are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them out of ringsnot so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questionsyou have a nimble wit I think itwas made of Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our miseryI will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom I know most faultsthe worst fault you have is to be in loveitis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am weary of youby my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found youhe is drowned in the brook look but in and you shall see himthere I shall see mine own figurewhich I take to be either a fool or a pheriull tarry no longer with you farewell good Signior loveI am glad of your departure Adieu good Monsieur MelancholyI will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forestervery well what would youI pray you what isit oclockyou should ask me what time o day theres no clock in the forestthen there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clockand why not the swift foot of Time had not that been as properby no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons iull tell you who Time ambles withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withalI prithee who doth he trot withalmarry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a sennight Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven yearwho ambles Time withalwith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withalwho doth he gallop withalwith a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon therewho stays it still withalwith lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moveswhere dwell you pretty youthwith this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoatare you native of this placeas the cony that you see dwell where she is kindledyour accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwellingI have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withalcan you remember any of the prinpal evils that he laid to the charge of womenthere were none prinpal they were all like one another as half-pence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match itI prithee recount some of themno I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind if I could meet that fancy-monger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon himI am he that is so love-shaked I pray you tell me your remedythere is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisonerwhat were his marksa lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man you are rather point-device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any otherfair youth I would I could make thee believe I loveme believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admiredI swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate hebut are you so much in love as your rimes speakneither rime nor reason can express how muchlove is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet I profess curing it by counseldid you ever cure any soyes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus I cured him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love initI would not be cured youthI would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo menow by the faith of my love I will tell me where it isgo with me to it and iull show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you gowith all my heart good youthnay you must call me Rosalind come sister will you gocome apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats Audrey and how Audrey am I the man yet doth my simple feature content youyour features lord warrant us what featuresI am here with thee and thy goats as the most caprious poet honest Ovid was among the GothsO knowledge ill-inhabited worse than Jove in a thatched housewhen a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly I would the gods had made thee poeticalI do not know what poetical is is it honest in deed and word is it a true thingno truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feigndo you wish then that the gods had made me poeticalI do truly for thou swearest to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feignwould you not have me honestno truly unless thou wert hard-favoured for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugara material foolwell I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honesttruly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dishI am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foulwell praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be I will marry thee and to that end I have been with sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple usI would fain see this meetingwell the gods give us joyamen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn-beasts but what though courage as horns are odious they are necessary it is said many a man knows no end of his goods right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife itis none of his own getting Horns even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed no as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want here comes sir Oliversir Oliver Martext you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapelis there none here to give the womanI will not take her on gift of any mantruly she must be given or the marriage is not lawfulproceed proceed iull give hergood even good master what-ye-callt how do you sir you are very well met God ild you for your last company I am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here sir nay pray be coveredwill you be married motleyas the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibblingand will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warpI am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wifego thou with me and let me counsel theecome sweet Audreywe must be married or we must live in bawdryfarewell good master Oliver notO sweet OliverO brave Oliverleave me not behind theebutwind awaybegone I sayI will not to wedding with theeitis no matter neer a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my callingnever talk to me I will weepdo I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a manbut have I not cause to weepas good cause as one would desire therefore weephis very hair is of the dissembling coloursomething browner than Judass marry his kisses are Judass own childreninfaith his hair is of a good colouran excellent colour your chesnut was ever the only colourand his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy breadhe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in thembut why did he swear he would come this morning and comes notnay certainly there is no truth in himdo you think soyes I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nutnot true in loveyes when he is in but I think he is not inyou have heard him swear downright he waswas is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmers of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your fatherI met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as OrlandoO thats a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes heremistress and master you have oft inquiredafter the shepherd that complained of lovewho you saw sitting by me on the turfpraising the proud disdainful shepherdessthat was his mistresswell and what of himif you will see a pageant truly playedbetween the pale complexion of true loveand the red glow of scorn and proud disdaingo hence a little and I shall conduct youif you will mark itO come let us removethe sight of lovers feedeth those in lovebring us to this sight and you shall sayiull prove a busy actor in their playsweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebesay that you love me not but say not soin bitterness the common executionerwhose heart the accustomed sight of death makes hardfalls not the axe upon the humbled neckbut first begs pardon will you sterner bethan he that dies and lives by bloody dropsI would not be thy executionerI fly thee for I would not injure theethou tellest me there is murder in mine eyeitis pretty sure and very probablethat eyes that are the frailest and softest thingswho shut their coward gates on atomiesshould be called tyrants butchers murderersnow I do frown on thee with all my heartand if mine eyes can wound now let them kill theenow counterfeit to swound why now fall downor if thou canst not O for shame for shamelie not to say mine eyes are murderersnow show the wound mine eye hath made in theescratch thee but with a pin and there remainssome scar of it lean but upon a rushthe catrice and capable impressurethy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyeswhich I have darted at thee hurt thee notnor I am sure there is no force in eyesthat can do hurtO dear Phebeif ever as that ever may be nearyou meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancythen shall you know the wounds invisiblethat loves keen arrows makebut till that timecome not thou near me and when that time comesafflict me with thy mocks pity me notas till that time I shall not pity theeand why I pray you who might be your motherthat you insult exult and all at onceover the wretched what though you have no beautyas by my faith I see no more in youthan without candle may go dark to bedmust you be therefore proud and pitilesswhy what means this why do you look on meI see no more in you than in the ordinaryof natures sale-work Ods my little lifeI think she means to tangle my eyes toono faith proud mistress hope not after ititis not your inky brows your black silk hairyour bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of creamthat can entame my spirits to your worshipyou foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow herlike foggy south puffing with wind and rainyou are a thousand times a properer manthan she a woman itis such fools as youthat make the world full of ill-favoured childrenitis not her glass but you that flatters herand out of you she sees herself more properthan any of her lineaments can show herbut mistress know yourself down on your kneesand thank heaven fasting for a good mans lovefor I must tell you friendly in your earsell when you can you are not for all marketscry the man mercy love him take his offerfoul is most foul being foul to be a scofferso take her to thee shepherd fare you wellsweet youth I pray you chide a year togetherI had rather hear you chide than this man woohes fallen in love with her foulness and shell fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks iull sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon mefor no ill will I bear youI pray you do not fall in love with mefor I am falser than vows made in winebesides I like you not if you will know my houseitis at the tuft of olives here hard bywill you go sister Shepherd ply her hardcome sister Shepherdess look on him betterand be not proud though all the world could seenone could be so abused in sight as hecome to our flockdead shepherd now I find thy saw of mightwho ever loved that loved not at first sight sweet Phebeha what sayst thou Silviussweet Phebe pity mewhy I am sorry for thee gentle Silviuswherever sorrow is relief would beif you do sorrow at my grief in loveby giving love your sorrow and my griefwere both exterminedthou hast my love is not that neighbourlyI would have youwhy that were covetousnesssilvius the time was that I hated theeand yet it is not that I bear thee lovebut since that thou canst talk of love so wellthy company which erst was irksome to meI will endure and iull employ thee toobut do not look for further recompensethan thine own gladness that thou art employedso holy and so perfect is my loveand I in such a poverty of gracethat I shall think it a most plenteous cropto glean the broken ears after the manthat the main harvest reaps loose now and thena scattered smile and that iull live uponknowest thou the youth that spoke to me erewhilenot very well but I have met him oftand he hath bought the cottage and the boundsthat the old carlot once was master ofthink not I love him though I ask for himitis but a peevish boy yet he talks wellbut what care I for words yet words do wellwhen he that speaks them pleases those that hearit is a pretty youth not very prettybut sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes himhell make a proper man the best thing in himis his complexion and faster than his tonguedid make offence his eye did heal it uphe is not very tall yet for his years hes tallhis leg is but so so and yet itis wellthere was a pretty redness in his lipa little riper and more lusty redthan that mixed in his cheek itwas just the differencebetwixt the constant red and mingled damaskthere be some women Silvius had they marked himin parcels as I did would have gone nearto fall in love with him but for my partI love him not nor hate him not and yethave more cause to hate him than to love himfor what had he to do to chide at mehe said mine eyes were black and my hair blackand now I am remembered scorned at meI marvel why I answered not againbut thats all one omittance is no quittanceiull write to him a very taunting letterand thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silviusphebe with all my heartiull write it straightthe matters in my head and in my heartI will be bitter with him and passing shortgo with me SilviusI prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with theethey say you are a melancholy fellowI am so I do love it better than laughingthose that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkardswhy itis good to be sad and say nothingwhy then itis good to be a postI have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels which by often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadnessa traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor handsyes I have gained my experienceand your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it toogood day and happiness dear Rosalindnay then God be wityou an you talk in blank versefarewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now Orlando where have you been all this while you a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight moremy fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promisebreak an hours promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him ofthe shoulder but iull warrant him heart-wholepardon me dear Rosalindnay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be wooed of a snailof a snailay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure I think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with himwhats thatwhy horns that such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wifevirtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuousand I am your Rosalindit pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than youcome woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an I were your very very RosalindI would kiss before I spokenay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking God warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kisshow if the kiss be deniedthen she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matterwho could be out being before his beloved mistressmarry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my witwhat of my suitnot out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your RosalindI take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of herwell in her person I say I will not have youthen in mine own person I dieno faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love-cause Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grean club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot mid-summer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for loveI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill meby this hand it will not kill a fly but come now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition and ask me what you will I will grant itthen love me Rosalindyes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and alland wilt thou have meay and twenty suchwhat sayest thouare you not goodI hope sowhy then can one desire too much of a good thing come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand Orlando what do you say sisterpray thee marry usI cannot say the wordsyou must begin Will you Orlando go to Will you Orlando have to wife this RosalindI willay but whenwhy now as fast as she can marry usthen you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife I take thee Rosalind for wifeI might ask you for your commission but I do take thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actionsso do all thoughts they are wingednow tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed herfor ever and a daysay a day without the ever no no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new-fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleepbut will my Rosalind do soby my life she will do as I doO but she is wiseor else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and itwill out at the key-hole stop that itwill fly with the smoke out at the chimneya man that hath a wife with such a wit he might say Wit whither wilt nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bedand what wit could wit have to excuse thatmarry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a foolfor these two hours Rosalind I will leave theealas dear love I cannot lack thee two hoursI must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock I will be with thee againay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me itis but one cast away and so come death Two oclock is your houray sweet Rosalindby my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promisewith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind so adieuwell Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let Time try Adieuyou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate we must have your doublot and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nestO coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of Portugalor rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs outno that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love iull tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando iull go find a shadow and sigh till he comeand iull sleepwhich is he that killed the deersir it was Ilets present him to the duke like aRoman conqueror and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory have you no song forester for this purposeyes sirsing it itis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enoughwhat shall he have that killed the deerhis leather skin and horns to wearthen sing him hometake thou no scorn to wear the hornit was a crest ere thou wast bornthy fathers father wore itand thy father bore itthe horn the horn the lusty hornis not a thing to laugh to scornhow say you now is it not past two oclock and here much OrlandoI warrant you with pure love and a troubled brain he hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep look who comes heremy errand is to you fair youthmy gentle Phebe did bid me give you thisI know not the contents but as I guessby the stern brow and waspish actionwhich she did use as she was writing of itit bears an angry tenour pardon meI am but as a guiltless messengerpatience herself would startle at this letterand play the swaggerer bear this bear allshe says I am not fair that I lack mannersshe calls me proud and that she could not love mewere man as rare as phoenix Ods my willher love is not the hare that I do huntwhy writes she so to me well shepherd wellthis is a letter of your own deviceno I protest I know not the contentsphebe did write itcome come you are a fooland turned into the extremity of loveI saw her hand she has a leathern handa freestone-coloured hand I verily did thinkthat her old gloves were on but itwas her handsshe has a housewifes hand but thats no matterI say she never did invent this letterthis is a mans invention and his handsure it is herswhy itis a boisterous and a cruel stylea style for challengers why she defies melike Turk to christian womans gentle braincould not drop forth such giant-rude inventionsuch Ethiop words blacker in their effectthan in their countenance Will you hear the letterso please you for I never heard it yetyet heard too much of Phebes crueltyshe Phebes me mark how the tyrant writesart thou god to shepherd turnedthat a maidens heart hath burnedcan a woman rail thuscall you this railingwhy thy godhead laid apartwarrest thou with a womans heartdid you ever hear such railingwhiles the eye of man did woo methat could do no vengeance to memeaning me a beastif the scorn of your bright eynehave power to raise such love in minealack in me what strange effectwould they work in mild aspectwhiles you chid me I did lovehow then might your prayers movehe that brings this love to theelittle knows this love in meand by him seal up thy mindwhether that thy youth and kindwill the faithful offer takeof me and all that I can makeor else by him my love denyand then iull study how to diecall you this chidingalas poor shepherddo you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more companygood morrow fair ones pray you if you knowwhere in the purlieus of this forest standsa sheepcote fenced about with olive-treeswest of this place down in the neighbour bottomthe rank of osiers by the murmuring streamleft on your right hand brings you to the placebut at this hour the house doth keep itselftheres none withinif that an eye may profit by a tonguethen should I know you by descriptionsuch garments and such years the boy is fairof female favour and bestows himselflike a ripe sister but the woman lowand browner than her brother are not youthe owner of the house I did inquire forit is no boast being asked to say we areorlando doth commend him to you bothand to that youth he calls his Rosalindhe sends this bloody napkin are you heI am what must we understand by thissome of my shame if you will know of mewhat man I am and how and why and wherethis handkercher was stainedI pray you tell itwhen last the young Orlando parted from youhe left a promise to return againwithin an hour and pang through the forestchewing the food of sweet and bitter fancylo what befell he threw his eye asideand mark what object did present itselfunder an oak whose boughs were mossed with ageand high top bald with dry antiquitya wretched ragged man oergrown with hairlay sleeping on his back about his necka green and gilded snake had wreathed itselfwho with her head nimble in threats approachedthe opening of his mouth but suddenlyseeing Orlando it unlinked itselfand with indented glides did slip awayinto a bush under which bushs shadea lioness with udders all drawn drylay couching head on ground with catlike watchwhen that the sleeping man should stir for itisthe royal disposition of that beastto prey on nothing that doth seem as deadthis seen Orlando did approach the manand found it was his brother his elder brotherO I have heard him speak of that same brotherand he did render him the most unnaturalthat lived mongst menand well he might so dofor well I know he was unnaturalbut to Orlando did he leave him therefood to the sucked and hungry lionesstwice did he turn his back and purposed sobut kindness nobler ever than revengeand nature stronger than his just occasionmade him give battle to the lionesswho quickly fell before him in which hurtlingfrom miserable slumber I awakedare you his brotherwas it you he rescuedwast you that did so oft contrive to kill himitwas I but itis not I I do not shameto tell you what I was since my conversionso sweetly tastes being the thing I ambut for the bloody napkinby and bywhen from the first to last betwixt us twotears our recountments had most kindly bathedas how I came into that desert placein brief he led me to the gentle dukewho gave me fresh array and entertainmentcommitting me unto my brothers lovewho led me instantly unto his cavethere stripped himself and here upon his armthe lioness had torn some flesh awaywhich all this while had bled and now he faintedand cried in fainting upon Rosalindbrief I recovered him bound up his woundand after some small space being strong at hearthe sent me hither stranger as I amto tell this story that you might excusehis broken promise and to give this napkindyed in his blood unto the shepherd youththat he in sport doth call his Rosalindwhy how now ganymede sweet ganymedemany will swoon when they do look on bloodthere is more in it Cousin ganymedelook he recoversI would I were at homewell lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the armbe of good cheer youth you a man you lack a mans heartI do so I confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited Heigh-hothis was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnestcounterfeit I assure youwell then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a manso I do but infaith I should have been a woman by rightcome you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards Good sir go with usthat will I for I must bear answer back how you excuse my brother

grape would open his lips when he put it into his mouth meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open you do love this maidI do sirgive me your hand art thou learnedno sirthen

invite the duke and alls contented followers go you and prepare Aliena for look you here comes my Rosalindgod save you brotherand you fair sisterO my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarfit is my armI thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lionwounded it is but with the eyes of a ladydid your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swound when he showed me your handkercheray and greater wonders than thatO I know where you are nay itis true there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and Ceasars thrasonical brag of I came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part themthey shall be married to-morrow and I will bid the duke to the nuptial but O how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes by so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes forwhy then to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for RosalindI can live no longer by thinkingI will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now I speak to some purpose that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that I can do strange things I have since I was three years old conversed with a magian most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes to-morrow human as she is and without any dangerspeakest thou in sober meaningsby my life I do which I tender dearly

I for no womanit is to be all made of faith and serviceand so am I for Phebeand I for ganymedeand I for Rosalindand I for no womanit is to be all made of fantasyall made of passion and all made of wishesall adoration duty and observanceall humbleness all patience and impatienceall purity all trial all obeisanceand so am I for Phebeand so am I for ganymedeand so am I for Rosalindand so am I for no womanif this be so why blame you me to love youif this be so why blame you me to love youif this be so why blame you me to love youwho do you speak to why blame you me to love you to

without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voiceinfaith infaith and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horseit was a lover and his lasswith a hey and a ho and a hey noninothat oer the green corn-field did passin the spring time the only pretty ring timewhen birds do sing hey ding a ding dingsweet lovers love the springbetween the acres of the ryewith a hey and a ho and a hey noninothese pretty country folks would liein the spring time &cthis carol they began that hourwith a hey and a ho and a hey noninohow that a life was but a flowerin the spring time &cand therefore take the present timewith a hey and a ho and a hey noninofor love is crowned with the primein the spring timetruly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneableyou are deceived sir we kept time we lost not our timeby my troth yes I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song God be wityou and God mend your voices come Audreydost thou believe Orlando that the boycan do all this that he hath promisedI sometimes do believe and sometimes do notas those that fear they hope and know they fearpatience once more whiles our compact is urgedyou say if I bring in your Rosalindyou will bestow her on Orlando herethat would I had I kingdoms to give with herand you say you will have her when I bring herthat would I were I of all kingdoms kingyou say that youll marry me if I be willingthat will I should I die the hour afterbut if you do refuse to marry meyoull give yourself to this most faithful shepherdso is the bargainyou say that youll have Phebe if she willthough to have her and death were both one thingI have promised to make all this matter evenkeep you your word O duke to give your daughteryou yours Orlando to receive his daughterkeep your word Phebe that youll marry meor else refusing me to wed this shepherdkeep your word Silvius that youll marry herif she refuse me and from hence I goto make these doubts all evenI do remember in this shepherd boysome lively touches of my daughters favourmy lord the first time that I ever saw himmethought he was a brother to your daughterbut my good lord this boy is forest-bornand hath been tutored in the rudimentsof many desperate studies by his unclewhom he reports to be a great magianobscured in the rcle of this forestthere is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are called foolssalutation and greeting to you allgood my lord bid him welcome this is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest he hath been a courtier he swearsif any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation I have trod a measure I have flattered a lady I have been politic with my friend smooth with mine enemy I have undone three tailors I have had four quarrels and like to have fought oneand how was that taen upfaith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh causehow seventh cause Good my lord like this fellowI like him very wellgod ild you sir I desire you of the like I press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin sir an ill-favoured thing sir but mine own a poor humour of mine sir to take that that no man else will Rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oysterby my faith he is very swift and sententiousaccording to the fools bolt sir and such dulcet diseasesbut for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh causeupon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming Audrey as thus sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous if I sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself this is called the quip modest if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish if again it was not well cut he would answer I spake not true this is called the reproof valiant if again it was not well cut he would say I lie this is called the countercheck quarrelsome and so to the lie rcumstantial and the lie direct and how oft did you say his beard was not well cutI durst go no further than the lie rcumstantial nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we measured swords and partedcan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lieO sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners I will name you the degrees the first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the countercheck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance the seventh the lie direct All these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as if you said so then I said so and they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the only peace-maker much virtue in if is not this a rare fellow my lord hes as good at any thing and yet a foolhe uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his witthen is there mirth in heavenwhen earthly things made evenatone togethergood duke receive thy daughterhymen from heaven brought

thou art minethy faith my fancy to thee doth combinelet me have audience for a word or twoI am the second son of old sir Rowlandthat bring these tidings to this fair assemblyduke Frederick hearing how that every daymen of great worth resorted to this forestaddressed a mighty power which were on footin his own conduct purposely to takehis brother here and put him to the swordand to the skirts of this wild wood he camewhere meeting with an old religious manafter some question with him was convertedboth from his enterprise and from the worldhis crown bequeathing to his banished brotherand all their lands restored to them againthat were with him exiled this to be trueI do engage my lifewelcome young manthou offerest fairly to thy brothers weddingto one his lands withheld and to the othera land itself at large a potent dukedomfirst in this forest let us do those endsthat here were well begun and well begotand after every of this happy numberthat have endured shrewd days and nights with usshall share the good of our returned fortuneaccording to the measure of their statesmeantime forget this new-falln dignityand fall into our rustic revelryplay music and you brides and bridegrooms allwith measure heaped in joy to the measures fallsir by your patience if I heard you rightlythe duke hath put on a religious lifeand thrown into neglect the pompous courthe hathto him will I out of these convertitesthere is much matter to be heard and learnedyou to your former honour I bequeathyour patience and your virtue well deserve

these ritesas we do trust theyll end in true delightsit is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush itis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and iull begin with the women I charge you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love you bear to women as I perceive by your simpering none of you hate them that between you and the women the play may please if I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that I defied not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewellcYmbeneyou do not meet a man but frowns our bloodsno more obey the heavens than our courtiersstill seem as does the kingbut whats the matterhis daughter and the heir of s kingdom whomhe purposed to his wifes sole son a widowthat late he married hath referred herselfunto a poor but worthy gentleman Shes weddedher husband banished she imprisoned allis outward sorrow though I think the kingbe touched at very heartnone but the kinghe that hath lost her too so is the queenthat most desired the match but not a courtieralthough they wear their faces to the bentof the kings looks hath a heart that is notglad at the thing they scowl atand why sohe that hath missed the princess is a thingtoo bad for bad report and he that hath herI mean that married her alack good manand therefore banished is a creature suchas to seek through the regions of the earthfor one his like there would be something failingin him that should compare I do not thinkso fair an outward and such stuff withinendows a man but heyou speak him farI do extend him sir within himselfcrush him together rather than unfoldhis measure dulywhats his name and birthI cannot delve him to the root his fatherwas called Silius who did join his honouragainst the Romans with Cassibelanbut had his titles by Tenantius whomhe served with glory and admired successso gained the sur-addition Leonatusand had besides this gentleman in questiontwo other sons who in the wars ofthe timedied with their swords in hand for which their fatherthen old and fond of issue took such sorrowthat he quit being and his gentle ladybig of this gentleman our theme deceasedas he was born the king he takes the babeto his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatusbreeds him and makes him of his bedchamberputs to him all the learnings that his timecould make him the receiver of which he tookas we do air fast as itwas ministeredand ins spring became a harvest lived in courtwhich rare it is to do most praised most loveda sample to the youngest to the more maturea glass that feated them and to the gravera child that guided dotards to his mistressfor whom he now is banished her own priceproclaims how she esteemed him and his virtueby her election may be truly readwhat kind of man he isI honour himeven out of your report but pray you tell meis she sole child to the kinghis only childhe had twosons if this be worth your hearingmark it the eldest of them at three years oldinthe swathing clothes the other from their nurserywere stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledgewhich way they wenthow long is this agosome twenty yearsthat a kings children should be so conveyedso slackly guarded and the search so slowthat could not trace themhowsoeer itis strangeor that the negligence may well be laughed atyet is it true sirI do well

pangs of barred affections though the kinghath charged you should not speak togetherOdissembling courtesy how fine this tyrantcan tickle where she wounds my dearest husbandI something fear my fathers wrath but nothingalways reserved my holy duty whathis rage can do on me you must be goneand I shall here abide the hourly shotof angry eyes not comforted to livebut that there is this jewel in the worldthat I may see againmy queen my mistressO lady weep no more lest I give causeto be suspected of more tendernessthan doth become a man I will remainthe loyalest husband that did eer plight trothmy residence in Rome at one Philarioswho to my father was a friend to meknown but by letter thither write my queenand with mine eyes iull drink the words you sendthough ink be made of gallbe brief I pray youif the king come I shall incur I know nothow much of his displeasureyet iull move himto walk this way I never do him wrongbut he does buy my injuries to be friendspays dear for my offencesshould we be taking leaveas long a term as yet we have to livethe loathness to depart would grow Adieunay stay a littlewere you but riding forth to air

loss so in our triflesI still win of you for my sake wear thisit is a manacle of love iull place itupon this fairest prisonerO the godswhen shall we see againalack the kingthou basest thing avoid hence from my sightif after this command thou fraught the courtwith thy unworthiness thou diest awaythourt poison to my bloodthe gods protect youand bless the good remainders of the courtI am gonethere cannot be a pinch in deathmore sharp than this isO disloyal thingthat shouldst repair my youth thou heapest insteada years age on meI beseech you sirharm not yourself with your vexationI am senseless of your wrath a touch more raresubdues all pangs all fearspast grace obediencepast hope and in despair that way past gracethat mightst have had the sole son of my queenO blessed that I might not I chose an eagleand did avoid a puttockthou tookest a beggar wouldst have made my thronea seat for basenessno I rather addeda lustre to itO thou vile onesirit is your fault that I have loved Posthumusyou bred him as my playfellow and he isa man worth any woman overbuys mealmost the sum he payswhat art thou madalmost sir heaven restore me would I werea neat-herds daughter and my Leonatusour neighbour shepherds sonthou foolish thingthey were again together you have donenot after our command away with herand pen her upbeseech your patience peacedear lady daughter peace sweet sovereignleave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfortout of your best advicenay let her languisha drop of blood a day and being ageddie of this follyfie you must give wayhere is your servant how now sir what newsmy lord your son drew on my masterhano harm I trust is donethere might have beenbut that my master rather played than foughtand had no help of anger they were partedby gentlemen at handI am very glad onityour sons my fathers friend he takes his partto draw upon an exile O brave sirI would they were in Afric both togethermyself by with a needle that I might prickthe goer-back why came you from your masteron his command he would not suffer meto bring him to the haven left these notesof what commands I should be subject towhen'tpleased you to employ methis hath beenyour faithful servant I dare lay mine honourhe will remain soI humbly thank your highnesspray walk awhileabout some half-hour henceI pray you speak with me you shall at leastgo see my lord aboard for this time leave mesir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice where air comes out air comes in theres none abroad so wholesome as that you ventif my shirt were bloody them to shift it have I hurt himno faith not so much as his patiencehurt him his bodys a passable carcass if he be not hurt it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurthis steel was in debt it went ofthe backside the townthe villain would not stand meno but he fled forward still toward your facestand you you have land enough of your own but he added to your having gave you some groundas many inches as you have oceans PuppiesI would they had not come between usso would I till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the groundand that she should love this fellow and refuse meif it be a sin to make a true election she is damnedsir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go not together shes a good sign but I have seen small reflection of her witshe shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt hercome iull to my chamber would there had been some hurt doneI wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no great hurtyoull go with usiull attend your lordshipnay come lets go togetherwell my lordI would thou grewest unto the shores of the havenand questionedst every sail if he should writeand I not have it itwere a paper lostas offered mercy is what was the lastthat he spake to theeit was his queen his queenthen waved his handkerchiefand kissed it madamsenseless linen happier therein than Iand that was allno madam for so longas he could make me with this eye or eardistinguish him from others he did keepthe deck with glove or hat or handkerchiefstill waving as the fits and stirs of s mindcould best express how slow his soul sailed onhow swift his shipthou shouldst have made himas little as a crow or less ere leftto after-eye himmadam so I didI would have broke mine eye-strings cracked them butto look upon him till the diminutionof space had pointed him sharp as my needlenay followed him till he had melted fromthe smallness of a gnat to air and thenhave turned mine eye and wept but good Pisaniowhen shall we hear from himbe assured madamwith his next vantageI did not take my leave of him but hadmost pretty things to say ere I could tell himhow I would think on him at certain hourssuch thoughts and such or I could make him swearthe shes of Italy should not betraymine interest and his honour or have charged himat the sixth hour of morn at noon at mid-nightto encounter me with orisons for thenI am in heaven for him or ere I couldgive him that parting kiss which I had setbetwixt two charming words comes in my fatherand like the tyrannous breathing of the northshakes all our buds from growingthe queen madamdesires your highness companythose things I bid you do get them dispatchedI will attend the queenmadam I shallbelieve it sir I have seen him in Britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but I could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by itemsyou speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and withinI have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as hethis matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matterand then his banishmentay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintancehis father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life here comes the Briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his qualityI beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearingsir we have known together in Orleanssince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay stillsir you oer-rate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a natureby your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgment if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slightfaith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fallen bothcan we with manners ask what was the differencesafely I think itwas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in Francethat lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn outshe holds her virtue still and I my mindyou must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italybeing so far provoked as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friendas fair and as good a kind of hand-in-hand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain if she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the ladyI praised her as I rated her so do I my stonewhat do you esteem it atmore than the world enjoyseither your unparagoned mistress is dead or shes outprized by a trifleyou are mistaken the one may be sold or given or if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the godswhich the gods have given youwhich by their graces I will keepyou may wear her in little yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizeable estimations the one is but frail and the other causal a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and lastyour Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ringlet us leave here gentlemensir with all my heart this worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at firstwith five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friendno noI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something but I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the worldyou are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what youre worthy of by your attemptwhats thata repulse though your attempt as you call it deserves more a punishment toogentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquaintedwould I had put my estate and my neighbours on the approbation of what I have spokewhat lady would you choose to assailyours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reservedI will wage against your gold gold to it my ring I hold dear as my finger itis part of ityou are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but I see you have some religion in you that you fearthis is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hopeI am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken I swearwill you I shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between s my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match heres my ringI will have it no layby the gods it is one if I bring you no suffient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainmentI embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand that you have prevailed I am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your swordyour hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recordedagreedwill this hold think yousignior Iachimo will not from it pray let us follow emwhiles yet the dew s on ground gather those flowersmake haste who has the note of themI madamdispatchnow master doctor have you brought those drugspleaseth your highness ay here they are madambut I beseech your grace without offencemy consence bids me ask wherefore you havecommanded of me these most poisonous compoundswhich are the movers of a languishing deathbut though slow deadlyI wonder doctorthou askest me such a question have I not beenthy pupil long hast thou not learned me howto make perfumes distil preserve yea sothat our great king himself doth woo me oftfor my confections Having thus far proceededunless thou thinkest me devilish is it not meetthat I did amplify my judgment inother conclusions I will try the forcesof these thy compounds on such creatures aswe count not worth the hanging but none humanto try the vigour of them and applyallayments to their act and by them gathertheir several virtues and effectsyour highnessshall from this practice but make hard your heartbesides the seeing these effects will beboth noisome and infectiousO content theehere comes a flattering rascal upon himwill I first work hes for his masterand enemy to my son how now Pisaniodoctor your service for this time is endedtake your own wayI do suspect you madambut you shall do no harmhark thee a wordI do not like her she doth think she hasstrange lingering poisons I do know her spiritand will not trust one of her malice witha drug of such damned nature those she haswill stupify and dull the sense awhilewhich first perchance shell prove on cats and dogsthen afterward up higher but there isno danger in what show of death it makesmore than the locking-up the spirits a timeto be more fresh reviving she is fooledwith a most false effect and I the truerso to be false with herno further service doctoruntil I send for theeI humbly take my leaveweeps she still sayst thou dost thou think in timeshe will not quench and let instructions enterwhere folly now possesses do thou workwhen thou shalt bring me word she loves my soniull tell thee on the instant thou art thenas great as is thy master greater forhis fortunes all lie speechless and his nameis at last gasp return he cannot norcontinue where he is to shift his beingis to exchange one misery with anotherand every day that comes comes to decaya days work in him what shalt thou expectto be depender on a thing that leanswho cannot be new built nor has no friendsso much as but to prop himthou takest upthou knowest not what but take it for thy labourit is a thing I made which hath the kingfive times redeemed from death I do not knowwhat is more cordial nay I prithee take itit is an earnest of a further goodthat I mean to thee Tell thy mistress howthe case stands with her doit as from thyselfthink what a chance thou changest on but thinkthou hast thy mistress still to boot my sonwho shall take notice of thee iull move the kingto any shape of thy preferment suchas thoult desire and then myself I chieflythat set thee on to this desert am boundto load thy merit richly call my womenthink on my wordsa sly and constant knavenot to be shaked the agent for his masterand the remembrancer of her to holdthe hand-fast to her lord I have given him thatwhich if he take shall quite unpeople herof leigers for her sweet and which she afterexcept she bend her humour shall be assuredto taste of tooso so well done well donethe violets cowslips and the prime-rosesbear to my closet fare thee well Pisaniothink on my wordsand shall dobut when to my good lord I prove untrueiull choke myself theres all iull do for youa father cruel and a step-dame falsea foolish suitor to a wedded ladythat hath her husband banished O that husbandmy supreme crown of grief and those repeatedvexations of it Had I been thief-stolnas my two brothers happy but most miserableis the desire thats glorious blessed be thosehow mean soer that have their honest willswhich seasons comfort who may this be fiemadam a noble gentleman of Romecomes from my lord with letterschange you madamthe worthy Leonatus is in safetyand greets your highness dearlythanks good siryou are kindly welcomeall of her that is out of door most richif she be furnished with a mind so rareshe is alone the

knowledge of your mistress home I grantwe were to question further but I nowprofess myself the winner of her honourtogether with your ring and not the wrongerof her or you having proceeded butby both your willsif you can make'tapparentthat you have tasted her in bed my handand ring is yours if not the foul opinionyou had of her pure honour gains or losesyour sword or mine or masterless leaves bothto who shall find themsir my rcumstancesbeing so near the truth as I will make themmust first induce you to believe whose strengthI will confirm with oath which I doubt notyoull give me leave to spare when you shall findyou need it notproceedfirst her bedchamberwhere I confess I slept not but professhad that was well worth watching it was hangedwith tapestry of silk and silver the storyproud Cleopatra when she met her Romanand Cydnus swelled above the banks or forthe press of boats or pride a piece of workso bravely done so rich that it did strivein workmanship and value which I wonderedcould be rarely and exactly wroughtsince the true life onit wasthis is trueand this you might have heard of here by meor by some othermore particularsmust justify my knowledgeso they mustor do your honour injurythe chimneyis south the chamber and the chimney-piecechaste Dian bathing never saw I figuresso likely to report themselves the cutterwas as another

andironsI had forgot them were two winking Cupidsof silver each on one foot standing nicelydepending on their brandsthis is her honourlet it be granted you have seen all this and praisebe given to your remembrance the descriptionof what is in her chamber nothing savesthe wager you have laidthen if you canbe pale I beg but leave to air this jewel seeand now itis up again it must be marriedto that your diamond iull keep themjoveonce more let me behold it is it thatwhich I left with hersir I thank her thatshe stripped it from her arm I see her yether pretty action did outsell her giftand yet enriched it too she gave it me and saidshe prized it oncemay be she plucked it offto send it meshe writes so to you doth sheO no no no itis true here take this tooit is a basilisk unto mine eyekills me to look onit let there be no honourwhere there is beauty truth where semblance lovewhere theres another man the vows of womenof no more bondage be to where they are madethan they are to their virtues which is nothingO above measure falsehave patience sirand take your ring again itis not yet wonit may be probable she lost it orwho knows if one of her women being corruptedhath stoln it from hervery trueand so I hope he came by'tback my ringrender to me some corporal sign about hermore evident than this for this was stolnby Jupiter I had it from her armhark you he swears by Jupiter he swearsitis true nay keep the ring itis true I am sureshe would not lose it her attendants areall sworn and honourable they induced to steal itand by a stranger no he hath enjoyed herthe cognizance of her incontinencyis this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearlythere take thy hire and all the fiends of helldivide themselves between yousir be patientthis is not strong enough to be believedof one persuaded well ofnever talk onitshe hath been colted by himif you seekfor further satisfying under her breastworthy the pressing lies a mole right proudof that most delicate lodging by my lifeI kissed it and it gave me present hungerto feed again though full you do rememberthis stain upon heray and it doth confirmanother stain as big as hell can holdwere there no more but itwill you hear morespare your arithmetic never count the turnsonce and a millioniull be swornno swearingif you will swear you have not done'tyou lieand I will kill thee if thou dost denythouest made me cuckoldiull deny nothingO that I had her here to tear her limb-mealI will go there and doit inthe court beforeher father iull do somethingquite besidesthe government of patience you have wonlets follow him and pervert the present wrathhe hath against himselfwith all my heartis there no way for men to be but womenmust be half-workers we are all bastards alland that most venerable man which Idid call my father was I know not wherewhen I was stamped some coiner with his toolsmade me a counterfeit yet my mother seemedthe Dian of that time so doth my wifethe nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeanceme of my lawful pleasure she restrainedand prayed me oft forbearance did it witha pudency so rosy the sweet view onitmight well have warmed old Saturn that I thought heras chaste as unsunned snow O all the devilsthis yellow Iachimo in an hour was'tnotor less at first perchance he spoke not butlike a full-acorned boar a German onecried O and mounted found no oppositionbut what he looked for should oppose and sheshould from encounter guard could I find outthe womans part in me for theres no motionthat tends to vice in man but I affirmit is the womans part be it lying note itthe womans flattering hers deceiving herslust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hersambitions covetings change of prides disdainnice longing slanders mutabilityall faults that man may name nay that hell knowswhy hers in part or all but rather allfor even to vicethey are not constant but are changing stillone vice but of a minute old for onenot half so old as that iull write against themdetest them curse them yet itis greater skillin a true hate to pray they have their willthe very devils cannot plague them betternow say what would Augustus Ceasar with uswhen Julius Ceasar whose remembrance yetlives in mens eyes and will to ears and tonguesbe theme and hearing ever was in this Britainand conquered it Cassibelan thine unclefamous in Ceasars praises no whit lessthan in his feats deserving it for himand his succession granted Rome a tributeyearly three thousand pounds which by thee latelyis left untenderedand to kill the marvelshall be so everthere be many Ceasarsere such another Julius Britain isa world by itself and we will nothing payfor wearing our own nosesthat opportunitywhich then they had to take from s to resumewe have again Remember sir my liegethe kings your ancestors together withthe natural bravery of your isle which standsas Neptunes park ribbed and paled inwith rocks unscaleable and roaring waterswith sands that will not bear your enemies boatsbut suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquestCeasar made here but made not here his bragof came and saw and overcame with shamethe first that ever touched him he was carriedfrom off our coast twice beaten and his shippingpoor ignorant baubles on our terrible seaslike egg-shells moved upon their surges crackedas easily gainst our rocks for joy whereofthe famed Cassibelan who was once at pointO giglot fortune to master Ceasars swordmade Luds town with rejoing-fires brightand Britons stiut with couragecome theres no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no moe such Ceasars other of them may have crooked noses but to owe such straight arms noneson let your mother endwe have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan I do not say I am one but I have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if Ceasar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you nowyou must knowtill the injurious Romans did extortthis tribute from us we were free Ceasars ambitionwhich swelled so much that it did almost stretchthe sides ofthe world against all colour heredid put the yoke upon s which to shake offbecomes a war-like people whom we reckonourselves to be we do say then to Ceasarour ancestor was that Mulmutius whichordained our laws whose use the sword of Ceasarhath too much mangled whose repair and franchiseshall by the power we hold be our good deedthough Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our lawswho was the first of Britain which did puthis brows within a golden crown and calledhimself a kingI am sorry Cymbelinethat I am to pronounce Augustus CeasarCeasar that hath more kings his servants thanthyself domestic officers thine enemyreceive it from me then war and confusionin Ceasars name pronounce Iagainst thee lookfor fury not to be resisted thus defiedI thank thee for myselfthou art welcome Caiusthy Ceasar knighted me my youth I spentmuch under him of him I gathered honourwhich he to seek of me again perforcebehoves me keep at utterance I am perfectthat the Pannonians and Dalmatians fortheir liberties are now in arms a precedentwhich not to read would show the Britons coldso Ceasar shall not find themlet proof speakhis majesty bids you welcome make pastime with us a day or two or longer if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our salt-water girdle if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and theres an endso sirI know your masters pleasure and he mineall the remain is welcome how of adultery wherefore write you notwhat monsters her accuser LeonatusO master what a strange infectionis falln into thy ear what false Italianas poisonous-tongued as handed hath prevailedon thy too ready hearing Disloyal noshes punished for her truth and undergoesmore goddess-like than wife-like such assaultsas would take in some virtue O my masterthy mind to her is now as low as werethy fortunes how that I should murder herupon the love and truth and vows which Ihave made to thy command I her her bloodif it be so to do good service neverlet me be counted serviceable how look Ithat I should seem to lack humanityso much as this fact comes to doit the letterthat I have sent her by her own commandshall give thee opportunity O damned paperblack as the ink thats on thee Senseless baubleart thou a feodary for this act and lookestso virgin-like without Lo here she comesI am ignorant in what I am commandedhow now Pisaniomadam here is a letter from my lordwho thy lord that is my lord LeonatusO learned indeed were that astronomerthat knew the stars as I his charactersheed lay the future open you good godslet what is here contained relish of loveof my lords health of his content yet notthat we two are asunder let that grieve himsome griefs are mednable that is one of themfor it doth physic love of his contentall but in that Good wax thy leave blessed beyou bees that make these locks of counsel loversand men in dangerous bonds pray not alikethough forfeiters you cast in prison yetyou clasp young Cupids tables Good news godsjustice and your fathers wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you O the dearest of creatures would not even renew me with your eyes take notice that I am in Cambria at Milford-haven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in loveO for a horse with wings Hearest thou Pisaniohe is at Milford-haven read and tell mehow far itis thither if one of mean affairsmay plod it in a week why may not Iglide thither in a day then true Pisaniowho longest like me to see thy lord who longestO let me bate but not like me yet longestbut in a fainter kind O not like mefor mines beyond beyond say and speak thickloves counsellor should fill the bores of hearingto the smothering of the sense how far it isto this same blessed Milford and by the waytell me how Wales was made so happy ast inherit such a haven but first of allhow we may steal from hence and for the gapthat we shall make in time from our hencegoingand our return to excuse but first how get hencewhy should excuse be born or ere begotwell talk of that hereafter Prithee speakhow many score of miles may we well ridebtwixt hour and hourone score btwixt sun and sunmadam s enough for you and too much toowhy one that rode to s execution mancould never go so slow I have heard of riding wagerswhere horses have been nimbler than the sandsthat run inthe clocks behalf but this is foolerygo bid my woman feign a sickness sayshell home to her father and provide me presentlya riding-suit no costlier than would fita franklins housewifemadam youre best considerI see before me man nor here nor herenor what ensues but have a fog in themthat I cannot look through away I pritheedo as I bid thee theres no more to sayaccessible is none but Milford waya goodly day not to keep house with suchwhose roofs as low as ours Stoop boys this gateinstructs you how to adore the heavens and bows youto a mornings holy office the gates of monarchsare arched so high that giants may jet throughand keep their impious turbans on withoutgood morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heavenwe house inthe rock yet use thee not so hardlyas prouder livers dohail heavenhail heavennow for our mountain sport up to yond hillyour legs are young iull tread these flats Considerwhen you above perceive me like a crowthat it is place which lessens and sets offand you may then revolve what tales I have told youof courts of princes of the tricks in warthis service is not service so being donebut being so allowed to apprehend thusdraws us a profit from all things we seeand often to our comfort shall we findthe sharded beetle in a safer holdthan is the full winged eagle O this lifeis nobler than attending for a checkricher than doing nothing for a bribeprouder than rustling in unpaid-for silksuch gain the cap of him that makes em fineyet keeps his book uncrossed no life to oursout of your proof you speak we poor unfledgedhave never winged from view ofthe nest nor know notwhat airs from home Haply this life is bestif quiet life be best sweeter to youthat have a sharper known well correspondingwith your stiff age but unto us it isa cell of ignorance travelling a-beda prison for a debtor that not daresto stride a limitwhat should we speak ofwhen we are old as you when we shall hearthe rain and wind beat dark December howin this our pinching cave shall we discoursethe freezing hours away we have seen nothingwe are beastly subtle as the fox for preylike war-like as the wolf for what we eatour valour is to chase what flies our cagewe make a quire as doth the prisoned birdand sing our bondage freelyhow you speakdid you but know the tys usuriesand felt them knowingly the art ofthe courtas hard to leave as keep whose top to climbis certain falling or so slippery thatthe fears as bad as falling the toil of the wara pain that only seems to seek out dangerinthe name of fame and honour which dies inthe searchand hath as oft a slanderous epitaphas record of fair act nay many timesdoth ill deserve by doing well whats worsemust curtsy at the censure O boys this storythe world may read in me my bodys markedwith Roman swords and my report was oncefirst with the best of note Cymbeline loved meand when a soldier was the theme my namewas not far off then was I as a treewhose boughs did bend with fruit but in one nighta storm or robbery call it what you willshook down my mellow hangings nay my leavesand left me bare to weatheruncertain favourmy fault being nothing as I have told you oftbut that two villains whose false oaths prevailedbefore my perfect honour swore to CymbelineI was confederate with the Romans sofollowed my banishment and this twenty yearsthis rock and these demesnes have been my worldwhere I have lived at honest freedom paidmore pious debts to heaven than in allthe fore-end of my time but up to the mountainsthis is not hunters language he that strikesthe venison first shall be the lord ofthe feastto him the other two shall ministerand we will fear no poison which attendsin place of greater state iull meet you in the valleyshow hard it is to hide the sparks of naturethese boys know little they are sons to the kingnor Cymbeline dreams that they are alivethey think they are mine and though trained up thus meanlyinthe cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hitthe roofs of palaces and nature prompts themin simple and low things to prince it muchbeyond the trick of others this Polydorethe heir of Cymbeline and Britain whothe king his father called guiderius Jovewhen on my three-foot stool I sit and tellthe war-like feats I have done his spirits fly outinto my story say thus mine enemy felland thus I set my foot on s neck even thenthe princely blood flows in his cheek he sweatsstrains his young nerves and puts himself in posturethat acts my words the younger brother Cadwalonce Arviragus in as like a figurestrikes life into my speech and shows much morehis own conceiving hark the game is rousedO Cymbeline heaven and my consence knowsthou didst unjustly banish me whereonat three and two years old I stole these babesthinking to bar thee of succession asthou reftest me of my lands Euriphilethou wast their nurse they took thee for their motherand every day do honour to her gravemyself Belarius that am Morgan calledthey take for natural father the game is upthou toldest me when we came from horse the placewas near at hand neer longed my mother soto see me first as I have now Pisanio manwhere is Posthumus what is in thy mindthat makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sighfrom the inward of thee one but painted thuswould be interpreted a thing perplexedbeyond self-explication put thyselfinto a haviour of less fear ere wildnessvanquish my staider senses whats the matterwhy tenderest thou that paper to me witha look untender if'tbe summer newssmile to'tbefore if winterly thou needestbut keep that countnance still my husbands handthat drug-damned Italy hath out-craftied himand hes at some hard point speak man thy tonguemay take off some extremity which to readwould be even mortal to meplease you readand you shall find me wretched man a thingthe most disdained of fortunethy mistress Pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me I speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge that part thou Pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyalwhat shall I need to draw my sword the paperhath cut her throat already no itis slanderwhose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongueoutvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breathrides on the posting winds and doth belieall corners of the world kings queens and statesmaids matrons nay the secrets of the gravethis viperous slander enters what cheer madamfalse to his bed what is it to be falseto lie in watch there and to think on himto weep btwixt clock and clock if sleep charge natureto break it with a fearful dream of himand cry myself awake thats false to s bed is italas good ladyI false thy consence witness Iachimothou didst accuse him of incontinencythou then lookedst like a villain now methinksthy favours good enough Some jay of Italywhose mother was her painting hath betrayed himpoor I am stale a garment out of fashionand for I am richer than to hang by the wallsI must be ripped to pieces with me Omens vows are womens traitors All good seemingby thy revolt O husband shall be thoughtput on for villany not born where'tgrowsbut worn a bait for ladiesgood madam hear metrue honest men being heard like falseneaswere in his time thought false and Sinons weepingdid scandal many a holy tear took pityfrom most true wretchedness so thou Posthumuswilt lay the leaven on all proper mengoodly and gallant shall be false and perjuredfrom thy great fail come fellow be thou honestdo thou thy masters bidding when thou seest hima little witness my obedience lookI draw the sword myself take it and hitthe innocent mansion of my love my heartfear not itis empty of all things but griefthy master is not there who was indeedthe riches of it do his bidding strikethou mayst be valiant in a better causebut now thou seemest a cowardhence vile instrumentthou shalt not damn my handwhy I must dieand if I do not by thy hand thou artno servant of thy masters Against self-slaughterthere is a prohibition so divinethat cravens my weak hand come heres my heartsomethings afore'tsoft soft well no defenceobedient as the scabbard what is herethe scriptures of the loyal Leonatusall turned to heresy away awaycorrupters of my faith you shall no morebe stomachers to my heart thus may poor foolsbelieve false teachers though those that are betrayeddo feel the treason sharply yet the traitorstands in worse case of woeand thou Posthumus thou that didst set upmy disobedience gainst the king my fatherand make me put into contempt the suitsof princely fellows shalt hereafter findit is no act of common passage buta strain of rareness and I grieve myselfto think when thou shalt be disedged by herthat now thou tirest on how thy memorywill then be panged by me Prithee dispatchthe lamb entreats the butcher wheres thy knifethou art too slow to do thy masters biddingwhen I desire it tooO gracious ladysince I received command to do this businessI have not slept one winkdoit and to bed theniull wake mine eyeballs blind firstwherefore thendidst undertake it why hast thou abusedso many miles with a pretence this placemine action and thine own our horses labourthe time inviting thee the perturbed courtfor my being absent whereunto I neverpurpose return why hast thou gone so farto be unbent when thou hast taen thy standthe elected deer before theebut to win timeto lose so bad employment in the whichI have considered of a course Good ladyhear me with patiencetalk thy tongue weary speakI have heard I am a strumpet and mine eartherein false struck can take no greater woundnor tent to bottom that but speakthen madamI thought you would not back againmost likebringing me here to kill menot so neitherbut if I were as wise as honest thenmy purpose would prove well it cannot bebut that my master is abused some villainsome villain ay and singular in his arthath done you both this cursed injurysome Roman courtezanno on my lifeiull give but notice you are dead and send himsome bloody sign of it for itis commandedI should do so you shall be missed at courtand that will well confirm itwhy good fellowwhat shall I do the while where bide how liveor in my life what comfort when I amdead to my husbandif youll back to the courtno court no father nor no more adowith that harsh noble simple nothing Clotenthat Cloten whose

that he swore to take our lives the lawprotects not us then why should we be tenderto let an arrogant piece of flesh threat usplay judge and executioner all himselffor we do fear the law what companydiscover you abroadno single soulcan we set eye on but in all safe reasonhe must have some attendants though his humourwas nothing but mutation ay and thatfrom one bad thing to worse not frenzy notabsolute madness could so far have ravedto bring him here alone although perhapsit may be heard at court that such as wecave here hunt here are outlaws and in timemay make some stronger head the which he hearingas it is like him might break out and swearheed fetch us in yet is it not probableto come alone either he so undertakingor they so suffering then on good ground we fearif

are as gentleas zephyrs blowing below the violetnot wagging his sweet head and yet as roughtheir royal blood enchafed as the rudest windthat by the top doth take the mountain pineand make him stoop to the vale itis wonderthat an invisible instinct should frame themto royalty unlearned honour untaughtvility not seen from other valourthat wildly grows in them but yields a cropas if it had been sowed yet still its strangewhat Clotens being here to us portendsor what his death will bring uswheres my brotherI have sent Clotens clotpoll down the streamin embassy to his mother his bodys hostagefor his returnmy ingenious instrumenthark Polydore it sounds but what occasionhath Cadwal now to give it motion harkis he at homehe went hence even nowwhat does he mean since death

himand will no doubt be foundthe time is troublesomewell slip you for a season but our jealousydoes yet dependso please-your majestythe Roman legions all from gallia drawnare landed on your coast with a supplyof Roman gentlemen by the senate sentnow for the counsel of my son and queenI am amazed with mattergood my liegeyour preparation can affront no lessthan what you hear of come more for more youre readythe want is but to put those powers in motionthat long to moveI thank you lets withdrawand meet the time as it seeks us we fear notwhat can from Italy annoy us butwe grieve at chances here awayI heard no letter from my master sinceI wrote him Imogen was slain itis strangenor hear I from my mistress who did promiseto yield me often tidings neither know Iwhat is betid to Cloten but remainperplexed in all the heavens still must workwherein I am false I am honest not true to be truethese present wars shall find I love my countryeven to the note ofthe king or iull fall in themall other doubts by time let them be clearedfortune brings in some boats that are not steeredthe noise is round about uslet us from itwhat pleasure sir find we in life to lock itfrom action and adventurenay what hopehave we in hiding us this way the Romansmust or for Britons slay us or receive usfor barbarous and unnatural revoltsduring their use and slay us aftersonswell higher to the mountains there secure usto the kings party theres no going newnessof Clotens death we being not known not musteredamong the bands may drive us to a renderwhere we have lived and so extort from s thatwhich we have done whose answer would be deathdrawn on with torturethis is sir a doubtin such a time nothing becoming younor satisfying usit is not likelythat when they hear the Roman horses neighbehold their quartered fires have both their eyesand ears so cloyed importantly as nowthat they will waste their time upon our noteto know from whence we areO I am knownof many in the army many yearsthough Cloten then but young you see not wore himfrom my remembrance and besides the kinghath not deserved my service nor your loveswho find in my exile the want of breedingthe certainty of this hard life aye hopelessto have the courtesy your cradle promisedbut to be still hot summers tanlings andthe shrinking slaves of winterthan be sobetter to cease to be pray sir to the armyI and my brother are not known yourselfso out of thought and thereto so oergrowncannot be questionedby this sun that shinesiull thither what thing is it that I neverdid see man die scarce ever looked on bloodbut that of coward hares hot goats and venisonnever bestrid a horse save one that hada rider like myself who neer wore rowelnor iron on his heel I am ashamedto look upon the holy sun to havethe benefit of his blessed beams remainingso long a poor unknownby heavens iull goif you will bless me sir and give me leaveiull take the better care but if you will notthe hazard therefore due fall on me bythe hands of Romansso say I amenno reason I since of your lives you setso slight a valuation should reservemy cracked one to more care have with you boysif in your country wars you chance to diethat is my bed too lads and there iull lielead leadthe time seems long their blood thinks scorntill it fly out and show them princes bornyea bloody cloth iull keep thee for I wishedthou shouldst be coloured thus you married onesif each of you should take this course how manymust murder wives much better than themselvesfor wrying but a little O Pisanioevery good servant does not all commandsno bond but to do just ones Gods if youshould have taen vengeance on my faults I neverhad lived to put on this so had you savedthe noble Imogen to repent and struckme wretch more worth your vengeance but alackyou snatch some hence for little faults thats loveto have them fall no more you some permitto second ills with ills each elder worseand make them dread it to the doers thriftbut Imogen is your own do your best willsand make me blessed to obey I am brought hitheramong the Italian gentry and to fightagainst my ladys kingdom itis enoughthat Britain I have killed thy mistress-pieceiull give no wound to thee therefore good heavenshear patiently my purpose iull disrobe meof these Italian weeds and suit myselfas does a Briton peasant so iull fightagainst the part I come with so iull diefor thee O Imogen even for whom my lifeis every breath a death and thus unknownpitied nor hated to the face of perilmyself iull dedicate let me make men knowmore valour in me than my habits showgods put the strength ofthe LeonatI in meto shame the guise ofthe world I will beginthe fashion less without and more withinthe heaviness and guilt within my bosomtakes off my manhood I have belied a ladythe princess of this country and the air onitrevengingly enfeebles me or could this carla very drudge of natures have subdued mein my profession knighthoods and honours borneas I wear mine are titles but of scornif that thy gentry Britain go beforethis

fought the king himselfof his wings destitute the army brokenand but the backs of Britons seen all flyingthrough a strait lane the enemy full-heartedlolling the tongue with slaughtering having workmore plentiful than tools to doit struck downsome mortally some slightly touched some fallingmerely through fear that the strait pass was dammedwith dead men hurt behind and cowards livingto die with lengthened shamewhere was this laneclose by the battle ditched and walled with turfwhich gave advantage to an anent soldieran honest one I warrant who deservedso long a breeding as his

the dish pays the shota heavy reckoning for you sir but the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern-bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth you come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and

not the toothache but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed I think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall goyes indeed do I fellowyour death has eyes in s head then I have not seen him so pictured you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journeys end I think youll never return to tell oneI tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going but such as wink and will not use themwhat an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness I am sure hangings the way of winkingknock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the kingthou bringest good news I am called to be made freeiull be hanged thenthou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the deadunless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets I never saw one so prone yet on my consence there are verier knaves desire to live for all he be a Roman and there be some of them too that die against their wills so should I if I were one I would we were all of one mind and one mind good O there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses I speak against my present profit but my wish hath a preferment

I wedded stole these childrenupon my banishment I moved her to thaving received the punishment beforefor that which I did then beaten for loyaltyexted me to treason Their dear lossthe more of you

sense in hardness that I canmake no collection of it let him showhis skill in the constructionphilarmonushere my good lordread and declare the meaningwhenas a lions whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock

doth import so muchthe piece of tender air thy virtuous daughterwhich we call mollis aer and mollis aerwe term it mulier which mulier I divineis this most constant wife who even nowanswering the letter of the oracleunknown to youunsought were clipped aboutwith this most tender airthis hath some seemingthe lofty cedar royal Cymbelinepersonates thee and thy lopped branches pointthy two

Luusalthough the victor we submit to Ceasarand to the Roman empire promisingto pay our wonted tribute from the whichwe were dissuaded by our wicked queenwhom heavens in justice both on her and hershave laid most heavy handthe fingers of the powers above do tunethe harmony of this peace the visionwhich I made known to Luus ere the strokeof this yet scarce-cold battle at this instantis full accomplished for the Roman eaglefrom south to west on wing soaring aloftlessened herself and in the beams ofthe sunso vanished which foreshowed our princely eaglethe imperial Ceasar should

disgrace of deathwhen spite of cormorant devouring Timethe endeavour of this present breath may buythat honour which shall bate his scythes keen edgeand make us heirs of all eternitytherefore brave conquerors for so you arethat war against your own affectionsand the huge army of the worlds desiresour late edict shall strongly stand in forcenavarre shall be the wonder of the worldour court shall be a little academestill and contemplative in living artyou three Berowne Dumaine and longavillehave sworn for three years term to live with memy fellow-scholars and to keep those statutesthat are recorded in this schedule hereyour oaths are passed and now subscribe your namesthat his own hand may strike his honour downthat violates the smallest branch hereinif you are armed to do as sworn to dosubscribe to your deep oaths and keep it tooI am resolved itis but a three years fastthe mind shall banquet though the body pinefat paunches have lean pates and dainty bitsmake rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the witsmy loving lord Dumaine is mortifiedthe grosser manner of these worlds delightshe throws upon the gross worlds baser slavesto love to wealth to pomp I pine and diewith all these living in philosophyI can but say their protestation overso much dear liege I have already swornthat is to live and study here three yearsbut there are other strict observancesas not to see a woman in that termwhich I hope well is not enrolled thereand one day in a week to touch no foodand but one meal on every day besidethe which I hope is not enrolled thereand then to sleep but three hours in the nightand not be seen to wink of all the daywhen I was wont to think no harm all nightand make a dark night too of half the daywhich I hope well is not enrolled thereO these are barren tasks too hard to keepnot to see ladies study fast not sleepyour oath is passed to pass away from theselet me say no my liege an if you pleaseI only swore to study with your graceand stay here in your court for three years spaceyou swore to that Berowne and to the restby yea and nay sir then I swore in jestwhat is the end of study let me knowwhy that to know which else we should not knowthings hid and barred you mean from common senseay that is studys god-like recompensecome on then I will swear to study soto know the thing I am forbid to knowas thus to study where I well may dinewhen I to feast expressly am forbidor study where to meet some mistress finewhen mistresses from common sense are hidor having sworn too hard-a-keeping oathstudy to break it and not break my trothif studys gain be thus and this be sostudy knows that which yet it doth not knowswear me to this and I will neer say nothese be the stops that hinder study quiteand train our intellects to vain delightwhy all delights are vain but that most vainwhich with pain purchased doth inherit painas painfully to pore upon a bookto seek the light of truth while truth the whiledoth falsely blind the eyesight of his looklight seeking light doth light of light beguileso ere you find where light in darkness liesyour light grows dark by losing of your eyesstudy me how to please the eye indeedby fixing it upon a fairer eyewho dazzling so that eye shall be his heedand give him light that it was blinded bystudy is like the heavens glorious sunthat will not be deep-searched with saucy lookssmall have continual plodders ever wonsave base authority from others booksthese earthly godfathers of heavens lightsthat give a name to every fixed starhave no more profit of their shining nightsthan those that walk and wot not what they aretoo much to know is to know nought but fameand every godfather can give a namehow well hes read to reason against readingproceeded well to stop all good proceedinghe weeds the corn and still lets grow the weedingthe spring is near when green geese are a-breedinghow follows thatfit in his place and timein reason nothingsomething then in rimeberowne is like an envious sneaping frostthat bites the first-born infants of the springwell say I am why should proud summer boastbefore the birds have any cause to singwhy should I joy in an abortive birthat Christmas I no more desire a rosethan wish a snow in Mays new-fangled mirthbut like of each thing that in season growsso you to study now it is too lateclimb oer the house to unlock the little gatewell sit you out go home Berowne adieuno my good lord I have sworn to stay with youand though I have for barbarism spoke morethan for that angel knowledge you can sayyet confident iull keep to what I sworeand bide the penance of each three years daygive me the paper let me read the sameand to the strictest decrees iull write my namehow well this yielding rescues thee from shameitem that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimedfour days agolets see the penalty on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penaltymarry that did Isweet lord and whyto fright them hence with that dread penaltya dangerous law against gentilityitem if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devisethis article my liege yourself must breakfor well you know here comes in embassythe French kings daughter with yourself to speaka maid of grace and complete majestyabout surrender up of Aquitaineto her decrepit sick and bed-rid fathertherefore this article is made in vainor vainly comes th admired princess hitherwhat say you lords why this was quite forgotso study evermore is overshotwhile it doth study to have what it wouldit doth forget to do the thing it shouldand when it hath the thing it hunteth mostitis won as towns with fire so won so lostwe must of force dispense with this decreeshe must lie here on mere necessitynecessity will make us all forswornthree thousand times within this three years spacefor every man with his affects is bornnot by might mastered but by speal graceif I break faith this word shall speak for meI am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large I write my nameand he that breaks them in the least degreestands in attainder of eternal shamesuggestions are to others as to mebut I believe although I seem so loathI am the last that will last keep his oathbut is there no quick recreation granteday that there is our court you know is hauntedwith a refined traveller of Spaina man in all the worlds new fashion plantedthat hath a mint of phrases in his brainone whom the music of his own vain tonguedoth ravish like enchanting harmonya man of complements whom right and wronghave chose as umpire of their mutinythis child of fancy that Armado hightfor interim to our studies shall relatein high-born words the worth of many a knightfrom tawny Spain lost in the worlds debatehow you delight my lords I know not Ibut I protest I love to hear him lieand I will use him for my minstrelsyarmado is a most illustrious wighta man of fire-new words fashions own knightcostard the swain and he shall be our sportand so to study three years is but shortwhich is the dukes own personthis fellow what wouldstI myself reprehend his own person for I am his graces tharborough but I would see his own person in flesh and bloodthis is hesignior Arm Arm commends you theres villany abroad this letter will tell you moresir the contempts thereof are as touching mea letter from the magnificent Armadohow long soever the matter I hope in God for high wordsa high hope for a low heaven God grant us patienceto hear or forbear laughingto hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear bothwell sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merrinessthe matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta the manner of it is I was taken with the mannerin what mannerin manner and form following sir all those three I was seen with her in the manor-house sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following now sir for the manner it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form in some formfor the following siras it shall follow in my correction and God defend the rightwill you hear this letter with attentionas we would hear an oraclesuch is the simplity of man to hearken after the fleshgreat deputy the welkins vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre my souls earths God and bodys fostering patronnot a word of Costard yetso it isit may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but sopeacebe to me and every man that dares not fightno wordsof other mens secrets I beseech youso it is besieged with sable-coloured melancholy I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air and as I am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when About the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when now for the ground which which I mean I walked upon it is ycleped thy park then for the place where where I mean I did encounter that most obscene and preposterous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden there did I see that low-spirited swain that base minnow of thy mirthmethat unlettered small-knowing soulmethat shallow vesselstill mewhich as I remember hight CostardO mesorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon with with O with but with this I passion to say wherewithwith a wenchwith a child of our grandmother Eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman him I as my everesteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet graces officer Antony Dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimationme ant please you I am Antony Dullfor Jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain I keep her as a vessel of thy laws fury and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial thine in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of dutythis is not so well as I looked for but the best that ever I hearday the best for the worst but sirrah what say you to thissir I confess the wenchdid you hear the proclamationI do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of itit was proclaimed a years imprisonment to be taken with a wenchI was taken with none sir I was taken with a damoselwell it was proclaimed edamosel this was no damosel neither sir she was a virgin it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin if it were I deny her virginity I was taken with a maidthis maid will not serve your turn sirthis maid will serve my turn sirsir I will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and waterI had rather pray a month with mutton and porridgeand Don Armado shall be your keepermy lord Berowne see him delivered oerand go we lords to put in practice thatwhich each to other hath so strongly sworniull lay my head to any good mans hatthese oaths and laws will prove an idle scornsirrah come onI suffer for the truth sir for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity Affliction may one day smile again and till then sit thee down sorrowboy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholya great sign sir that he will look sadwhy sadness is one and the self-same thing dear impno no O lord sir nohow canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender juvenalby a familiar demonstration of the working my tough seniorwhy tough senior why tough seniorwhy tender juvenal why tender juvenalI spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tenderand I tough senior as an appertinent title to your old time which we may name toughpretty and apthow mean you sir I pretty and my saying apt or I apt and my saying prettythou pretty because littlelittle pretty because little wherefore aptand therefore apt because quickspeak you this in my praise masterin thy condign praiseI will praise an eel with the same praisewhat that an eel is ingeniousthat an eel is quickI do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my bloodI am answered sirI love not to be crossedhe speaks the mere contrary crosses love not himI have promised to study three years with the dukeyou may do it in an hour sirimpossiblehow many is one thrice toldI am ill at reckoning it fitteth the spirit of a tapsteryou are a gentleman and a gamester sirI confess both they are both the varnish of a complete manthen I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts toit doth amount to one more than twowhich the base vulgar do call threetruewhy sir is this such a piece of study now heres three studied ere youll thrice wink and how easy it is to put years to the word three and study three years in two words the danng horse will tell youa most fine figureto prove you a pherI will hereupon confess I am in love and as it is base for a soldier to love so am I in love with a base wench if drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it I would take Desire prisoner and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devised curtsy I think scorn to sigh methinks I should outswear Cupid comfort me boy what great men have been in lovehercules mastermost sweet Hercules more authority dear boy name more and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriagesamson master he was a man of good carriage great carriage for he carried the towngates on his back like a porter and he was in loveO well-knit Samson strong-jointed Samson I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates I am in love too who was Samsons love my dear Motha woman masterof what complexionof all the four or the three or the two or one of the fourtell me presely of what complexionof the sea-water green siris that one of the four complexionsas I have read sir and the best of them toogreen indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love of that colour methinks Samson had small reason for it he surely affected her for her witit was so sir for she had a green witmy love is most immaculate white and redmost maculate thoughts master are masked under such coloursdefine define well-educated infantmy fathers wit and my mothers tongue assist mesweet invocation of a child most pretty and patheticalif she be made of white and redher faults will neer be knownfor blushing cheeks by faults are bredand fears by pale white shownthen if she fear or be to blameby this you shall not knowfor still her cheeks possess the samewhich native she doth owea dangerous rime master against the reason of white and redis there not a ballad boy of the king and the Beggarthe world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but I think now itis not to be found or if it were it would neither serve for the writing nor the tuneI will have that subject newly writ oer that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent boy I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard she deserves wellto be whipped and yet a better love than my mastersing boy my spirit grows heavy in loveand thats great marvel loving a light wenchI say singforbear till this company be pastsir the dukes pleasure is that you keep Costard safe and you must let him take no delight nor no penance but a must fast three days a week for this damsel I must keep her at the park she is allowed for the day-womanfare you wellI do betray myself with blushing maidmanI will visit thee at the lodgethats herebyI know where it is situatelord how wise you areI will tell thee wonderswith that faceI love theeso I heard you sayand so farewellfair weather after youcome Jaquenetta awayvillain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardonedwell sir I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomachthou shalt be heavily punishedI am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but lightly rewardedtake away this villain shut him upcome you transgressing slave awaylet me not be pent up sir I will fast being looseno sir that were fast and loose thou shalt to prisonwell if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen some shall seewhat shall some seenay nothing master Moth but what they look upon it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore I will say nothing I thank God I have as little patience as another man and therefore I can be quietI do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread I shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if I love and how can that be true love which is falsely attempted love is a familiar love is a devil there is no evil angel but love yet was Samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit Cupids butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules club and therefore too much odds for a Spaniards rapier the first and second clause will not serve my turn the passado he respects not the duello he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men Adieu valour rust rapier be still drum for your manager is in love yea he loveth Assist me some extemporal god of rime for I am sure I shall turn sonneter Devise wit write pen for I am for whole volumes in folionow madam summon up your dearest spiritsconsider whom the king your father sendsto whom he sends and whats his embassyyourself held precious in the worlds esteemto parley with the sole inheritorof all perfections that a man may owematchless Navarre the plea of no less weightthan Aquitaine a dowry for a queenbe now as prodigal of all dear graceas nature was in making graces dearwhen she did starve the general world besideand prodigally gave them all to yougood lord Boyet my beauty though but meanneeds not the painted flourish of your praisebeauty is bought by judgment of the eyenot uttered by base sale of chapmens tonguesI am less proud to hear you tell my worththan you much willing to be counted wisein spending your wit in the praise of minebut now to task the tasker good Boyetyou are not ignorant all-telling famedoth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vowtill painful study shall out-wear three yearsno woman may approach his silent courttherefore to us seemth it a needful coursebefore we enter his forbidden gatesto know his pleasure and in that behalfbold of your worthiness we single youas our best-moving fair solitortell him the daughter of the king of Franceon serious business craving quick dispatchimportunes personal conference with his gracehaste signify so much while we attendlike humble-visaged suitors his high willproud of employment willingly I goall pride is willing pride and yours is sowho are the votaries my loving lordsthat are vow-fellows with this virtuous dukelord longaville is oneknow you the manI know him madam at a marriage feastbetween lord Perigort and the beauteous heirof Jacques falconbridge solemnizedin normandy saw I this longavillea man of sovereign parts he is esteemedwell fitted in the arts glorious in armsnothing becomes him ill that he would wellthe only soil of his fair virtues glossif virtues gloss will stain with any soilis a sharp wit matched with too blunt a willwhose edge hath power to cut whose will still willsit should none spare that come within his powersome merry mocking lord belike isit sothey say so most that most his humours knowsuch short-lived wits do wither as they growwho are the restthe young Dumaine a well-accomplished youthof all that virtue love for virtue lovedmost power to do most harm least knowing illfor he hath wit to make an ill shape goodand shape to win grace though he had no witI saw him at the duke Alen ons onceand much too little of that good I sawis my report to his great worthinessanother of these students at that timewas there with him if I have heard a truthberowne they call him but a merrier manwithin the limit of becoming mirthI never spent an hours talk withalhis eye begets occasion for his witfor every object that the one doth catchthe other turns to a mirth-moving jestwhich his fair tongue conceits expositordelivers in such apt and gracious wordsthat aged ears play truant at his talesand younger hearings are quite ravishedso sweet and voluble is his discoursegod bless my ladies are they all in lovethat every one her own hath garnishedwith such bedecking ornaments of praisehere comes Boyetnow what admittance lordnavarre had notice of your fair approachand he and his competitors in oathwere all addressed to meet you gentle ladybefore I came Marry thus much I have learnthe rather means to lodge you in the fieldlike one that comes here to besiege his courtthan seek a dispensation for his oathto let you enter his unpeeled househere comes Navarrefair princess welcome to the court of Navarrefair I give you back again and welcome I have not yet the roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mineyou shall be welcome madam to my courtI will be welcome then conduct me thitherhear me dear lady I have sworn an oathour Lady help my lord hell be forswornnot for the world fair madam by my willwhy will shall break it will and nothing elseyour ladyship is ignorant what it iswere my lord so his ignorance were wisewhere now his knowledge must prove ignoranceI hear your grace hath sworn out house-keepingitis deadly sin to keep that oath my lordand sin to break itbut pardon me I am too sudden-boldto teach a teacher ill beseemeth

such questionsyour wits too hot it speeds too fast itwill tirenot till it leave the rider in the mirewhat time o daythe hour that fools should asknow fair befall your maskfair fall the face it coversand send you many loversamen so you be nonenay then I will be gonemadam your father here doth intimatethe payment of a hundred thousand crownsbeing but the one half of an entire sumdisbursed by my father in his warsbut say that he or we as neither havereceived that sum yet there remains unpaida hundred thousand more in surety of the whichone part of Aquitaine is bound to usalthough not valued to the moneys worthif then the king your father will restorebut that one half which is unsatisfiedwe will give up our right in Aquitaineand hold fair friendship with his majestybut that it seems he little purposethfor here he doth demand to have repaida hundred thousand crowns and not demandson payment of a hundred thousand crownsto have his title live in Aquitainewhich we much rather had depart withaland have the money by our father lentthan Aquitaine so gelded as it isdear princess were not his requests so farfrom reasons yielding your fair self should makea yielding gainst some reason in my breastand go well satisfied to France againyou do the king my father too much wrongand wrong the reputation of your namein so unseeming to confess receiptof that which hath so faithfully been paidI do protest I never heard of itand if you prove it iull repay it backor yield up Aquitainewe arrest your wordboyet you can produce acquittancesfor such a sum from speal officersof Charles his fathersatisfy me soso please your grace the packet is not comewhere that and other spealties are boundto-morrow you shall have a sight of themit shall suffice me at which interviewall liberal reason I will yield untomeantime receive such welcome at my handas honour without breach of honour maymake tender of to thy true worthinessyou may not come fair princess in my gatesbut here without you shall be so receivedas you shall deem yourself lodged in my heartthough so denied fair harbour in my houseyour own good thoughts excuse me and farewellto-morrow shall we visit you againsweet health and fair desires consort your gracethy own wish wish I thee in every placelady I will commend you to mine own heartpray you do my commendations I would be glad to see itI would you heard it groanis the fool sicksick at the heartalack let it bloodwould that do it goodmy physic says ay will you prickt

lips are no common though several they bebelonging to whomto my fortunes and megood wits will be jangling but gentles agreethis civil war of wits were much better usedon Navarre and his book-men for here itis abusedif my observation which very seldom liesby the hearts still rhetoric disclosed with eyesdeceive me not now Navarre is infectedwith whatwith that which we lovers entitle affectedyour reasonwhy all his behaviours did make their retireto the court of his eye peeping thorough desirehis heart like an agate with your print impressedproud with his form in his eye pride expressedhis tongue all impatient to speak and not seedid stumble with haste in his eyesight to beall senses to that sense did make their repairto feel only looking on fairest of fairmethought all his senses were locked in his eyeas jewels in crystal for some prince to buywho tendring their own worth from where they were glasseddid point you to buy them along as you passedhis faces own margent did quote such amazesthat all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazesiull give you Aquitaine and all that is hisan you give him for my sake but one loving kisscome to our pavilion Boyet is disposedbut to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosedI only have made a mouth of his eyeby adding a tongue which I know will not hethou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfullyhe

for my love day would turn to nightof all complexions the culled sovereigntydo meet as at a fair in her fair cheekwhere several worthies make one dignitywhere nothing wants that want itself doth seeklend me the flourish of all gentle tonguesfie painted rhetoric O she needs it notto things of sale a sellers praise belongsshe passes praise then praise too short doth blota withered hermit

eye to lookno face is fair that is not full so blackO paradox Black is the badge of hellthe hue of dungeons and the scowl of nightand beautys crest becomes the heavens welldevils soonest tempt resembling spirits of lightO if in black my ladys brows be deckedit mourns that painting and usurping hairshould ravish doters with a false aspectand therefore is she born to make black fairher favour turns the fashion of the daysfor native blood is counted painting nowand therefore red that would avoid dispraisepaints itself black to imitate her browto look like her are chimney-sweepers blackand since her time are colliers counted brightand Ethiops of their sweet complexion crackdark needs no candles now for dark is lightyour mistresses dare never come in rainfor fear their colours should be washed awayitwere good yours did for sir to tell you plainiull find a fairer face not washed to-dayiull prove her fair or talk till doomsday hereno devil will fright thee then so much as sheI never knew man hold vile stuff so dearlook heres thy lovemy foot and her face seeO if the streets were paved with thine eyesher feet were much too dainty for such treadO vile then as she goes what upward liesthe street should see as she walked over headbut what of this are we not all in lovenothing so sure and thereby all forswornthen leave this chat and good Berowne now proveour loving lawful and our faith not tornay marry there some flattery for this evilO some authority how to proceedsome tricks some quillets how to cheat the devilsome salve for perjuryO itis more than needhave at you then affections men-at-armsconsider what you first did swear untoto fast to study and to see no womanflat treason gainst the kingly state of youthsay can you fast your stomachs are too youngand abstinence engenders maladiesand where that you have vowed to study lordsin that each of you hath forsworn his bookcan you still dream and pore and thereon lookfor when would you my lord or you or youhave found the ground of studys excellencewithout the beauty of a womans facefrom womens eyes this doctrine I derivethey are the ground the books the academesfrom whence doth spring the true Promethean firewhy universal plodding poisons upthe nimble spirits in the arteriesas motion and long-during action tiresthe sinewy vigour of the travellernow for not looking on a womans faceyou have in that forsworn the use of eyesand study too the causer of your vowfor where is any author in the worldteaches such beauty as a womans eyelearning is but an adjunct to ourselfand where we are our learning likewise isthen when ourselves we see in ladies eyesdo we not likewise see our learning thereO we have made a vow to study lordsand in that vow we have forsworn our booksfor when would you my liege or you or youin leaden contemplation have found outsuch fiery numbers as the prompting eyesof beautys tutors have enriched you withother slow arts entirely keep the brainand therefore finding barren practisersscarce show a harvest of their heavy toilbut love first learned in a ladys eyeslives not alone immured in the brainbut with the motion of all elementscourses as swift as thought in every powerand gives to every power a double powerabove their functions and their officesit adds a precious seeing to the eyea lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blinda lovers ear will hear the lowest soundwhen the suspious head of theft is stoppedloves feeling is more soft and sensiblethan are the tender horns of cockled snailsloves tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in tastefor valour is not love a Herculesstill climbing trees in the Hesperidessubtle as Sphinx as sweet and musicalas bright Apollos lute strung with his hairand when love speaks the voice of all the godsmakes heaven drowsy with the harmonynever durst poet touch a pen to writeuntil his ink were tempered with loves sighsO then his lines would ravish savage earsand plant in tyrants mild humilityfrom womens eyes this doctrine I derivethey sparkle still the right Promethean firethey are the books the arts the academesthat show contain and nourish all the worldelse none at all in aught proves excellentthen fools you were these women to forswearor keeping what is sworn you will prove foolsfor wisdoms sake a word that all men loveor for loves sake a word that loves all menor for mens sake the authors of these womenor womens sake by whom we men are menlet us once lose our oaths to find ourselvesor else we lose ourselves to keep our oathsit is religion to be thus forswornfor charity itself fulfils the lawand who can sever love from charitysaint Cupid then and soldiers to the fieldadvance your standards and upon them lordspell-mell down with them but be first advisedin conflict that you get the sun of themnow to plain-dealing lay these glozes byshall we resolve to woo these girls of Franceand win them too therefore let us devisesome entertainment for them in their tentsfirst from the park let us conduct them thitherthen homeward every man attach the handof his fair mistress in the afternoonwe will with some strange pastime solace themsuch as the shortness of the time can shapefor revels dances masks and merry hoursforerun fair love strewing her way with flowersaway away no time shall be omittedthat will betime and may by us be fittedallons allons Sowed cockle reaped no cornand justice always whirls in equal measurelight wenches may prove plagues to men forswornif so our copper buys no better treasuresatis quod suffitI praise God for you sir your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affection audaous

like cowards and fly hencesaint Denis to Saint Cupid what are theythat charge their breath against us say scout sayunder the cool shade of a sycamoreI thought to close mine eyes some half an hourwhen lo to interrupt my purposed resttoward that shade I might behold addrestthe king and his companions warilyI stole into a neighbour thicket byand overheard what you shall overhearthat by and by disguised they will be heretheir herald is a pretty knavish pagethat well by heart hath conned his embassageaction and accent did they teach him therethus must thou speak and thus thy body bear and ever and anon they made a doubtpresence majestical would put him outfor quoth the king an angel shalt thou seeyet fear not thou but speak audaously the boy replied An angel is not evilI should have feared her had she been a devil with that all laughed and clapped him on the shouldermaking the bold wag by their praises bolderone rubbed his elbow thus and fleered and sworea better speech was never spoke beforeanother with his finger and his thumbcryed Via we will doit come what will come the third he capered and cried All goes well the fourth turned on the toe and down he fellwith that they all did tumble on the groundwith such a zealous laughter so profoundthat in this spleen ridiculous appearsto check their folly passions solemn tearsbut what but what come they to visit usthey do they do and are apparelled thuslike Muscovites or Russians as I guesstheir purpose is to parle to court and danceand every one his love-feat will advanceunto his several mistress which theyll knowby favours several which they did bestowand will they so the gallants shall be taskedfor ladies we will every one be maskedand not a man of them shall have the gracedespite of suit to see a ladys facehold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wearand then the king will court thee for his dearhold take thou this my sweet and give me thineso shall Berowne take me for Rosalineand change you favours too so shall your loveswoo contrary deceived by these removescome on then wear the favours most in sightbut in this changing what is your intentthe effect of my intent is to cross theirsthey do it but in mocking merrimentand mock for mock is only my intenttheir several counsels they unbosom shallto loves mistook and so be mocked withalupon the next occasion that we meetwith visages displayed to talk and greetbut shall we dance if they desire us toitno to the death we will not move a footnor to their penned speech render we no gracebut while itis spoke each turn away her facewhy that contempt will kill the speakers heartand quite divorce his memory from his parttherefore I do it and I make no doubtthe rest will neer come in if he be outtheres no such sport as sport by sport oerthrownto make theirs ours and ours none but our ownso shall we stay mocking intended gameand they well mocked depart away with shamethe trumpet sounds

linen since when iull be sworn he wore none but a dish-clout of Jaquenettas and that a wears next his heart for a favourgod save you madamwelcome Marcadebut that thou interruptest our merrimentI am sorry madam for the news I bringis heavy in my tongue the king your fatherdead for my lifeeven so my tale is toldworthies away the scene begins to cloudfor my own part I breathe free breath I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and I will right myself like a soldierhow fares your majestyboyet prepare I will away to-nightmadam not so I do beseech you stayprepare I say I thank you gracious lordsfor all your fair endeavours and entreatout of a new-sad soul that you vouchsafein your rich wisdom to excuse or hidethe liberal opposition of our spiritsif over-boldly we have borne ourselvesin the converse of breath your gentlenesswas guilty of it farewell worthy lorda heavy heart bears not a nimble tongueexcuse me so coming so short of thanksfor my great suit so easily obtainedthe extreme part of time extremely formsall causes to the purpose of his speedand often at his very loose dedesthat which long process could not arbitrateand though the mourning brow of progenyforbid the smiling courtesy of lovethe holy suit which fain it would convinceyet since loves argument was first on footlet not the cloud of sorrow justle itfrom what it purposed since to wail friends lostis not by much so wholesome-profitableas to rejoice at friends but newly foundI understand you not my griefs are doublehonest plain words best pierce the ear of griefand by these badges understand the kingfor your fair sakes have we neglected timeplayed foul play with our oaths your beauty ladieshath much deformed us fashioning our humourseven to the opposed end of our intentsand what in us hath seemed ridiculousas love is full of unbefitting strainsall wanton as a child skipping and vainformed by the eye and therefore like the eyefull of stray shapes of habits and of formsvarying in subjects as the eye doth rollto every varied object in his glancewhich parti-coated presence of loose loveput on by us if in your heavenly eyeshave misbecome our oaths and gravitiesthose heavenly eyes that look into these faultssuggested us to make therefore ladiesour love being yours the error that love makesis likewise yours we to ourselves prove falseby being once false for ever to be trueto those that make us both fair ladies youand even that falsehood in itself a sinthus purifies itself and turns to gracewe have received your letters full of loveyour favours the embassadors of loveand in our maiden counselrated themat courtship pleasant jest and courtesyas bombast and as lining to the timebut more devout than this in our respectshave we not been and therefore met your lovesin their own fashion like a merrimentour letters madam showed much more than jestso did our lookswe did not quote them sonow at the latest minute of the hourgrant us your lovesa time methinks too shortto make a world-without-end bargain inno no my lord your grace is perjured muchfull of dear guiltiness and therefore thisif for my love as there is no such causeyou will do aught this shall you do for meyour oath I will not trust but go with speedto some forlorn and naked hermitageremote from all the pleasures of the worldthere stay until the twelve celestial signshave brought about their annual reckoningif this austere insoable lifechange not your offer made in heat of bloodif frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weedsnip not the gaudy blossoms of your lovebut that it bear this trial and last lovethen at the expiration of the yearcome challenge me challenge me by these desertsand by this virgin palm now kissing thineI will be thine and till that instant shutmy woful self up in a mourning houseraining the tears of lamentationfor the remembrance of my fathers deathif this thou do deny let our hands partneither intitled in the others heartif this or more than this I would denyto flatter up these powers of mine with restthe sudden hand of death close up mine eyehence ever then my heart is in thy breastand what to me my love and what to meyou must be purged too your sins are rackedyou are attaint with faults and perjurytherefore if you my favour mean to geta twelvemonth shall you spend and never restbut seek the weary beds of people sickbut what to me my love but what to mea wife a beard fair health and honestywith three-fold love I wish you all these threeO shall I say I thank you gentle wifenot so my lord a twelvemonth and a dayiull mark no words that smooth-faced wooers saycome when the king doth to my lady comethen if I have much love iull give you someiull serve thee true and faithfully till thenyet swear not lest you be forsworn againwhat says Mariaat the twelvemonths endiull change my black gown for a faithful friendiull stay with patience but the time is longthe liker you few taller are so youngstudies my lady mistress look on mebehold the window of my heart mine eyewhat humble suit attends thy answer thereimpose some service on me for thy loveoft have I heard of you my lord Berownebefore I saw you and the worlds large tongueproclaims you for a man replete with mocksfull of comparisons and wounding floutswhich you on all estates will executethat lie within the mercy of your witto weed this wormwood from your fruitful brainand therewithal to win me if you pleasewithout the which I am not to be wonyou shall this twelvemonth term from day to dayvisit the speechless sick and still conversewith groaning wretches and your task shall bewith all the fierce endeavour of your witto enforce the pained impotent to smileto move wild laughter in the throat of deathit cannot be it is impossiblemirth cannot move a soul in agonywhy thats the way to choke a gibing spiritwhose influence is begot of that loose gracewhich shallow laughing hearers give to foolsa jests prosperity lics in the earof him that hears it never in the tongueof him that makes it then if sickly earsdeafed with the clamours of their own dear groanswill hear your idle scorns continue themand I will have you and that fault withalbut if they will not throw away that spiritand I shall find you empty of that faultright joyful of your reformationa twelvemonth well befall what will befalliull jest a twelvemonth in a hospitalay sweet my lord and so I take my leaveno madam we will bring you on your wayour wooing doth not end like an old playjack hath not Jill these ladies courtesymight well have made our sport a comedycome sir it wants a twelvemonth and a dayand then itwill endthats too long for a playsweet majesty vouchsafe mewas not that Hectorthe worthy knight of TroyI will kiss thy royal finger and take leave I am a votary I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three years but most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo it should have followed in the end of our showcall them forth quickly we will do soholla approachthis side is Hiems winter this Ver the Spring the one maintained by the owl the other by the cuckoo Ver beginspringwhen daisies pied and violets blueand lady-smocks all silver-whiteand cuckoo-buds of yellow huedo paint the meadows with delightthe cuckoo then on every treemocks married men for thus sings hecuckoocuckoo cuckoo O word of fearunpleasing to a married earwhen shepherds pipe on oaten strawsand merry larks are ploughmens clockswhen turtles tread and rooks and dawsand maidens bleach their summer smocksthe cuckoo then on every treemocks married men for thus sings hecuckoocuckoo cuckoo O word of fearunpleasing to a married earwinterwhen icles hang by the walland Dick the shepherd blows his nailand Tom bears logs into the halland milk comes frozen home in pailwhen blood is nipped and ways be foulthen nightly sings the staring owltu-whotu-whit tu-who a merry notewhile greasy Joan doth keel the potwhen all aloud the wind doth blowand coughing drowns the parsons sawand birds sit brooding in the snowand Marians nose looks red and rawwhen roasted crabs hiss in the bowlthen nightly sings the staring owltu-whotu-whit tu-who a merry notewhile greasy Joan doth keel the potthe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo you that way we this waymeasure for Measureescalusmy lordof government the properties to unfoldwould seem in me to affect speech and discoursesince I am put to know that your own senceexceeds in that the lists of all advicemy strength can give you then no more remainsbut that to your suffiency as your worth is ableand let them work the nature of our peopleour tys institutions and the termsfor common justice youre as pregnant inas art and practice hath enriched anythat we remember there is our commissionfrom which we would not have you warp call hitherI say bid come before us Angelowhat figure of us think you he will bearfor you must know we have with speal soulelected him our absence to supplylent him our terror drest him with our loveand given his deputation all the organsof our own power what think you of itif any in Vienna be of worthto undergo such ample grace and honourit is lord Angelolook where he comesalways obedient to your graces willI come to know your pleasureangelothere is a kind of character in thy lifethat to th observer doth thy historyfully unfold Thyself and thy belongingsare not thine own so proper as to wastethyself upon thy virtues they on theeheaven doth with us as we with torches donot light them for themselves for if our virtuesdid not go forth of us itwere all alikeas if we had them not Spirits are not finely touchedbut to fine issues nor nature never lendsthe smallest scruple of her excellencebut like a thrifty goddess she determinesherself the glory of a creditorboth thanks and use but I do bend my speechto one that can my part in him advertisehold therefore Angeloin our remove be thou at full ourselfmortality and mercy in Viennalive in thy tongue and heart old Escalusthough first in question is thy secondarytake thy commissionnow good my lordlet there be some more test made of my metalbefore so noble and so great a figurebe stamped upon itno more evasionwe have with a leavened and prepared choiceproceeded to you therefore take your honoursour haste from hence is of so quick conditionthat it prefers itself and leaves unquestionedmatters of needful value we shall write to youas time and our concernings shall importunehow it goes with us and do look to knowwhat doth befall you here so fare you wellto the hopeful execution do I leave youof your commissionsyet give leave my lordthat we may bring you something on the waymy haste may not admit itnor need you on mine honour have to dowith any scruple your scope is as mine ownso to enforce or qualify the lawsas to your soul seems good give me your handiull privily away I love the peoplebut do not like to stage me to their eyesthough it do well I do not relish welltheir loud applause and Aves vehementnor do I think the man of safe discretionthat does affect it Once more fare you wellthe heavens give safety to your purposeslead forth and bring you back in happinessI thank you fare you wellI shall desire you sir to give me leaveto have free speech with you and it concerns meto look into the bottom of my placea power I have but of what strength and natureI am not yet instructeditis so with me let us withdraw togetherand we may soon our satisfaction havetouching that pointiull wait upon your honourif the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the kingheaven grant us its peace but not the king of Hungarysamenthou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the tablethou shalt not steal ay that he razedwhy itwas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal theres not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat doth relish the petition well that prays for peaceI never heard any soldier dislike itI believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was saidno a dozen times at leastwhat in metrein any proportion or in any languageI think or in any religionay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all gracewell there went but a pair of shears between usI grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the listand thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou art a three-piled piece I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a French velvet do I speak feelingly nowI think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after theeI think I have done myself wrong have I notyes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or freebehold behold where madam Mitigation comes I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come toto what I prayjudgeto three thousand dolours a yearay and morea French crown morethou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am soundnay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of theehow now which of your hips has the most profound saticawell well theres one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you allwhos that I pray theemarry sir thats Claudio Signior Claudioclaudio to prison itis not sonay but I know itis so I saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped offbut after all this fooling I would not have it so art thou sure of thisI am too sure of it and it is for getting madam Julietta with childbelieve me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever prese in promise-keepingbesides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purposebut most of all agreeing with the proclamationaway lets go learn the truth of itthus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty I am custom-shrunkhow now whats the news with youyonder man is carried to prisonwell what has he donea womanbut whats his offencegroping for trouts in a peculiar riverwhat is there a maid with child by himno but theres a woman with maid by him you have not heard of the proclamation have youwhat proclamation manall houses of resort in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked downand what shall become of those in the tythey shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for thembut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled downto the ground mistresswhy heres a change indeed in the commonwealth what shall become of mecome fear not you good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place you need not change your trade iull be your tapster still courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be consideredwhats to do here Thomas tapsterlets withdrawhere comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and theres madam Julietfellow why dost thou show me thus to the worldbear me to prison where I am committedI do it not in evil dispositionbut from lord Angelo by speal chargethus can the demi-god Authoritymake us pay down for our offence by weightthe words of heaven on whom it will it willon whom it will not so yet still itis justwhy how now Claudio whence comes this restraintfrom too much liberty my Luo libertyas surfeit is the father of much fastso every scope by the immoderate useturns to restraint our natures do pursuelike rats that ravin down their proper banea thirsty evil and when we drink we dieif I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment whats thy offence Claudiowhat but to speak of would offend againwhat isit murdernolecherycall it soaway sir you must goone word good friend Luo a word with youa hundred if theyll do you any goodis lechery so looked afterthus stands it with me upon a true contractI got possession of Juliettas bedyou know the lady she is fast my wifesave that we do the denunation lackof outward order this we came not toonly for propagation of a dowerremaining in the coffer of her friendsfrom whom we thought it meet to hide our lovetill time had made them for us but it chancesthe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentwith character too gross is writ on Julietwith child perhapsunhappily even soand the new deputy now for the dukewhether it be the fault and glimpse of newnessor whether that the body public bea horse whereon the governor doth ridewho newly in the seat that it may knowhe can command lets it straight feel the spurwhether the tyranny be in his placeor in his eminence that fills it upI stagger in but this new governorawakes me all the enrolled penaltieswhich have like unscoured armour hung by the wallso long that nineteen zodiacs have gone roundand none of them been worn and for a namenow puts the drowsy and neglected actfreshly on me itis surely for a nameI warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off Send after the duke and appeal to himI have done so but hes not to be foundI prithee Luo do me this kind servicethis day my sister should the cloister enterand there receive her approbationacquaint her with the danger of my stateimplore her in my voice that she make friendsto the strict deputy bid herself assay himI have great hope in that for in her youththere is a prone and speechless dialectsuch as move men beside she hath prosperous artwhen she will play with reason and discourseand well she can persuadeI pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack iull to herI thank you good friend Luowithin two hourscome officer awayno holy father throw away that thoughtbelieve not that the dribbling dart of lovecan pierce a complete bosom why I desire theeto give me secret harbour hath a purposemore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsof burning youthmay your grace speak of itmy holy sir none better knows than youhow I have ever loved the life removedand held in idle price to haunt assemblieswhere youth and cost and witless bravery keepsI have delivered to lord Angeloa man of stricture and firm abstinencemy absolute power and place here in Viennaand he supposes me travelled to Polandfor so I have strewed it in the common earand so it is received now pious siryou will demand of me why I do thisgladly my lordwe have strict statutes and most biting lawsthe needful bits and curbs to headstrong steedswhich for this fourteen years we have let sleepeven like an oergrown lion in a cavethat goes not out to prey now as fond fathershaving bound up the threatning twigs of birchonly to stick it in their childrens sightfor terror not to use in time the rodbecomes more mocked than feared so our decreesdead to infliction to themselves are deadand liberty plucks justice by the nosethe baby beats the nurse and quite athwartgoes all decorumit rested in your gracet unloose this tied-up justice when you pleasedand it in you more dreadful would have seemedthan in lord AngeloI do fear too dreadfulsith itwas my fault to give the people scopetwould be my tyranny to strike and gall themfor what I bid them do for we bid this be donewhen evil deeds have their permissive passand not the punishment therefore indeed my fatherI have on Angelo imposed the officewho may in the ambush of my name strike homeand yet my nature never in the sightto do it slander and to behold his swayI will as itwere a brother of your ordervisit both prince and people therefore I pritheesupply me with the habit and instruct mehow I may formally in person bear melike a true friar Moe reasons for this actionat our more leisure shall I render youonly this one lord Angelo is presestands at a guard with envy scarce confessesthat his blood flows or that his appetiteis more to bread than stone hence shall we seeif power change purpose what our seemers beand have you nuns no further privilegesare not these large enoughyes truly I speak not as desiring morebut rather wishing a more strict restraintupon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clareho peace be in this placewhos that which callsit is a mans voice gentle Isabellaturn you the key and know his business of himyou may I may not you are yet unswornwhen you have vowed you must not speak with menbut in the presence of the prioressthen if you speak you must not show your faceor if you show your face you must not speakhe calls again I pray you answer himpeace and prosperity who isit that callshail virgin if you be as those cheek-rosesproclaim you are no less can you so stead meas bring me to the sight of Isabellaa novice of this place and the fair sisterto her unhappy brother Claudiowhy her unhappy brother let me askthe rather for I now must make you knowI am that Isabella and his sistergentle and fair your brother kindly greets younot to be weary with you hes in prisonwoe me for whatfor that which if myself might be his judgehe should receive his punishment in thankshe hath got his friend with childsir make me not your storyit is trueI would not though itis my familiar sinwith maids to seem the lapwing and to jesttongue far from heart play with all virgins soI hold you as a thing enskyed and saintedby your renouncement an immortal spiritand to be talked with in sincerityas with a saintyou do blaspheme the good in mocking medo not believe it fewness and truth itis thusyour brother and his lover have embracedas those that feed grow full as blossoming timethat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsto teeming foison even so her plenteous wombexpresseth his full tilth and husbandrysome one with child by him my cousin Julietis she your cousinadoptedly asschool-maids change their namesby vain though apt affectionshe it isO let him marry herthis is the pointthe duke is very strangely gone from hencebore many gentlemen myself being onein hand and hope of action but we do learnby those that know the very nerves of statehis givings out were of an infinite distancefrom his true-meant design upon his placeand with full line of his authoritygoverns lord Angelo a man whose bloodis very snow-broth one who never feelsthe wanton stings and motions of the sensebut doth rebate and blunt his natural edgewith profits of the mind study and fasthe to give fear to use and libertywhich have for long run by the hideous lawas mice by lions hath picked out an actunder whose heavy sense your brothers lifefalls into forfeit he arrests him on itand follows close the rigour of the statuteto make him an example All hope is goneunless you have the grace by your fair prayerto soften Angelo and thats my pith of businesstwixt you and your poor brotherdoth he so seek his lifehes censured himalready and as I hear the provost hatha warrant for his executionalas what poor abilitys in meto do him goodassay the power you havemy power alas I doubtour doubts are traitorsand make us lose the good we oft might winby fearing to attempt go to lord Angeloand let him learn to know when maidens suemen give like gods but when they weep and kneelall their petitions are as freely theirsas they themselves would owe themiull see what I can dobut speedilyI will about it straightno longer staying but to give the Mothernotice of my affair I humbly thank youcommend me to my brother soon at nightiull send him certain word of my successI take my leave of yougood sir adieuwe must not make a scarecrow of the lawsetting it up to fear the birds of preyand let it keep one shape till custom make ittheir perch and not their terroray but yetlet us be keen and rather cut a littlethan fall and bruise to death Alas this gentlemanwhom I would save had a most noble fatherlet but your honour knowwhom I believe to be most strait in virtuethat in the working of your own affectionshad time cohered with place or place with wishingor that the resolute acting of your bloodcould have attained the effect of your own purposewhether you had not some time in your lifeerred in this point which now you censure himand pulled the law upon youitis one thing to be tempted Escalusanother thing to fall I not denythe jury passing on the prisoners lifemay in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoguiltier than him they try whats open made to justicethat justice seizes what know the lawsthat thieves do pass on thieves itis very pregnantthe jewel that we find we stoop and take itbecause we see it but what we do not seewe tread upon and never think of ityou may not so extenuate his offencefor I have had such faults but rather tell mewhen I that censure him do so offendlet mine own judgment pattern out my deathand nothing come in partial sir he must diebe it as your wisdom willwhere is the provosthere if it like your honoursee that Claudiobe executed by nine to-morrow morningbring him his confessor let him be preparedfor thats the utmost of his pilgrimagewell heaven forgive him and forgive us allsome rise by sin and some by virtue fallsome run from brakes of ice and answer noneand some condemned for a fault alonecome bring them away if these be good people in a common-weal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses I know no law bring them awayhow now sir whats your name and whats the matterif it please your honour I am the poor dukes constable and my name is Elbow I do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactorsbenefactors well what benefactors are they are they not malefactorsif it please your honour I know not well what they are but prese villains they are that I am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good christians ought to havethis comes off well heres a wise officergo to what quality are they of Elbow is your name why dost thou not speak Elbowhe cannot sir hes out at elbowwhat are you

well as she that this house if it be not a bawds house it is pity of her life for it is a naughty househow dost thou know that constablemarry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman cardinally given might have been accused in fornication adultery and all uncleanliness thereby the womans meansay sir by mistress Overdones means but as she spit in his face so she defied himsir if it please your honour this is not soprove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove itdo you hear how he misplacessir she came in great with child and longing saving your honours reverence for stewed prunes sir we had but two in the house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a fruit-dish a dish of some three-pence your honours have seen such dishes they are not China dishes but very good dishesgo to go to no matter for the dish sirno indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the right but to the point as I say this mistress Elbow being as I say with child and being great-bellied and longing as I said for prunes and having but two in the dish as I said master Froth here this very man having eaten the rest as I said and as I say paying for them very honestly for

the souls that were were forfeit onceand he that might the vantage best have tookfound out the remedy how would you beif he which is the top of judgment shouldbut judge you as you are O think on

must die to-morrowto-morrow O thats sudden Spare him spare himhes not prepared for death even for our kitchenswe kill the fowl of season shall we serve heavenwith less respect than we do ministerto our gross selves Good good my lord bethink youwho is it that hath died for this offencetheres many have committed itay well saidthe law hath not been dead though it hath sleptthose many had not dared to do that evilif that the first that did th edict infringehad answered for his deed now itis awaketakes note of what is done and like a prophetlooks in a glass that shows what future evilseither new or by remissness new-conceivedand so in progress to be hatched and bornare now to have no successive degreesbut ere they live to endyet show some pityI show it most of all when I show justicefor then I pity those I do not knowwhich a dismissed offence would after galland do him right that answering one foul wronglives not to act another be satisfiedyour brother dies to-morrow be contentso you must be the first that gives this sentenceand he that suffers O it is excellentto have a giants strength but it is tyrannousto use it like a giantthats well saidcould great men thunderas Jove himself does Jove would neer be quietfor every pelting petty officerwould use his heaven for thunder nothing but thundermerful heaventhou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltsplitest the unwedgeable and gnarled oakthan the soft myrtle but man proud mandrest in a little brief authoritymost ignorant of what hes most assuredhis glassy essence like an angry apeplays such fantastic tricks before high heavenas make the angels weep who with our spleenswould all themselves laugh mortalO to him to him wench he will relenthes coming I perceivetpray heaven she win himwe cannot weigh our brother with ourselfgreat men may jest with saints itis wit in thembut in the less foul profanationthourt in the right girl more o thatthat in the captains but a choleric wordwhich in the soldier is flat blasphemyart advised o that more onitwhy do you put these sayings upon mebecause authority though it err like othershath yet a kind of medine in itselfthat skins the vice ofthe top go to your bosomknock there and ask your heart what it doth knowthats like my brothers fault if it confessa natural guiltiness such as is hislet it not sound a thought upon your tongueagainst my brothers lifeshe speaks and itissuch sense that my sense breeds with it fare you wellgentle my lord turn backI will bethink me come again to-morrowhark how iull bribe you Good my lord turn backhow bribe meay with such gifts that heaven shall share with youyou had marred all elsenot with fond sicles of the tested goldor stones whose rates are either rich or pooras fancy values them but with true prayersthat shall be up at heaven and enter thereere sun-rise prayers from preserved soulsfrom fasting maids whose minds are dedicateto nothing temporalwell come to me to-morrowgo to itis well awayheaven keep your honour safeamenfor I am that way going to temptationwhere prayers crossat what hour to-morrowshall I attend your lordshipat any time fore noonsave your honourfrom thee even from thy virtuewhats this whats this is this her fault or minethe tempter or the tempted who sins mosthanot she nor doth she tempt but it is Ithat lying by the violet in the sundo as the carrion does not as the flowercorrupt with virtuous season can it bethat modesty may more betray our sensethan womans lightness Having waste ground enoughshall we desire to raze the sanctuaryand pitch our evils there O fie fie fiewhat dost thou or what art thou Angelodost thou desire her foully for those thingsthat make her good O let her brother livethieves for their robbery have authoritywhen judges steal themselves what do I love herthat I desire to hear her speak againand feast upon her eyes what isit I dream onO cunning enemy that to catch a saintwith saints dost bait thy hook most dangerousis that temptation that doth goad us onto sin in loving virtue never could the strumpetwith all her double vigour art and natureonce stir my temper but this virtuous maidsubdues me quite Ever till nowwhen men were fond I smiled and wondered howhail to you provost so I think you areI am the provost whats your will good friarbound by my charity and my blessed orderI come to visit the afflicted spiritshere in the prison do me the common rightto let me see them and to make me knowthe nature of their crimes that I may ministerto them accordinglyI would do more than that if more were needfullook here comes one a gentlewoman of minewho falling in the flaws of her own youthhath blistered her report she is with childand he that got it sentenced a young manmore fit to do another such offencethan die for thiswhen must he dieas I do think to-morrowI have provided for you stay a whileand you shall be conductedrepent you fair one of the sin you carryI do and bear the shame most patientlyiull teach you how you shall arraign your consenceand try your penitence if it be soundor hollowly put oniull gladly learnlove you the man that wronged youyes as I love the woman that wronged himso then it seems your most offenceful actwas mutually committedmutuallythen was your sin of heavier kind than hisI do confess it and repent it fatheritis meet so daughter but lest you do repentas that the sin hath brought you to this shamewhich sorrow is always toward ourselves not heavenshowing we would not spare heaven as we love itbut as we stand in fearI do repent me as it is an eviland take the shame with joythere restyour partner as I hear must die to-morrowand I am going with instruction to himgods grace go with you Beneditemust die to-morrow O injurious lovethat respites me a life whose very comfortis still a dying horroritis pity of himwhen I would pray and think I think and prayto several subjects heaven hath my empty wordswhilst my invention hearing not my tongueanchors on Isabel heaven in my mouthas if I did but only chew his nameand in my heart the strong and swelling evilof my conception the state whereon I studiedis like a good thing being often readgrown feared and tedious yea my gravitywherein let no man hear me I take pridecould I with boot change for an idle plumewhich the air beats for vain O place O formhow often dost thou with thy case thy habitwrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsto thy false seeming Blood thou art bloodlets write good angel on the devils hornitis not the devils cresthow now whos thereone Isabel a sisterdesires access to youteach her the wayO heavenswhy does my blood thus muster to my heartmaking both it unable for itselfand dispossessing all my other partsof necessary fitnessso play the foolish throngs with one that swoundscome all to help him and so stop the airby which he should revive and even sothe general subject to a well-wished kingquit their own part and in obsequious fondnesscrowd to his presence where their untaught lovemust needs appear offencehow now fair maidI am come to know your pleasurethat you might know it would much better please methan to demand what itis your brother cannot liveeven so Heaven keep your honouryet may he live awhile and it may beas long as you or I yet he must dieunder your sentenceyeawhen I beseech you that in his reprievelonger or shorter he may be so fittedthat his soul sicken notha fie these filthy vices it were as goodto pardon him that hath from nature stolena man already made as to remittheir saucy sweetness that do coin heavens imagein stamps that are forbid itis all as easyfalsely to take away a life true madeas to put metal in restrained meansto make a false oneitis set down so in heaven but not in earthsay you so then I shall pose you quicklywhich had you rather that the most just lawnow took your brothers life or to redeem himgive up your body to such sweet uncleannessas she that he hath stainedsir believe thisI had rather give my body than my soulI talk not of your soul our compelled sinsstand more for number than for accompthow say younay iull not warrant that for I can speakagainst the thing I say Answer to thisI now the voice of the recorded lawpronounce a sentence on your brothers lifemight there not be a charity in sinto save this brothers lifeplease you to doitiull take it as a peril to my soulit is no sin at all but charitypleased you to doit at peril of your soulwere equal poise of sin and charitythat I do beg his life if it be sinheaven let me bear it you granting of my suitif that be sin iull make it my morn prayerto have it added to the faults of mineand nothing of your answernay but hear meyour sense pursues not mine either you are ignorantor seem so craftily and thats not goodlet me be ignorant and in nothing goodbut graciously to know I am no betterthus wisdom wishes to appear most brightwhen it doth tax itself as these black masksproclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderthan beauty could displayed but mark meto be received plain iull speak more grossyour brother is to diesoand his offence is so as it appearsaccountant to the law upon that paintrueadmit no other way to save his lifeas I subscribe not that nor any otherbut in the loss of question that you his sisterfinding yourself desired of such a personwhose credit with the judge or own great placecould fetch your brother from the manaclesof the all-building law and that there wereno earthly mean to save him but that eitheryou must lay down the treasures of your bodyto this supposed or else to let him sufferwhat would you doas much for my poor brother as myselfthat is were I under the terms of deathth impression of keen whips id wear as rubiesand strip myself to death as to a bedthat longing have been sick for ere id yieldmy body up to shamethen must your brother dieand itwere the cheaper waybetter it were a brother died at oncethan that a sister by redeeming himshould die for everwere not you then as cruel as the sentencethat you have slandered soignomy in ransom and free pardonare of two houses lawful mercyis nothing kin to foul redemptionyou seemed of late to make the law a tyrantand rather proved the sliding of your brothera merriment than a viceO pardon me my lord it oft falls outto have what we would have we speak not what we meanI something do excuse the thing I hatefor his advantage that I dearly lovewe are all frailelse let my brother dieif not a feodary but only heowe and succeed thy weaknessnay women are frail tooay as the glasses where they view themselveswhich are as easy broke as they make formswomen help heaven men their creation marin profiting by them nay call us ten times frailfor we are soft as our complexions areand credulous to false printsI think it welland from this testimony of your own sexsince I suppose we are made to be no strongerthan faults may shake our frames let me be boldI do arrest your words be that you arethat is a woman if you be more youre noneif you be one as you are well expressedby all external warrants show it nowby putting on the destined liveryI have no tongue but one gentle my lordlet me entreat you speak the former languageplainly conceive I love youmy brother did love Juliet and you tell methat he shall die forithe shall not Isabel if you give me loveI know your virtue hath a licence initwhich seems a little fouler than it isto pluck on othersbelieve me on mine honourmy words express my purposeha little honour to be much believedand most pernious purpose Seeming seemingI will proclaim thee Angelo look foritsign me a present pardon for my brotheror with an outstretched throat iull tell the world aloudwhat man thou artwho will believe thee Isabelmy unsoiled name the austereness of my lifemy vouch against you and my place inthe statewill so your accusation overweighthat you shall stifle in your own reportand smell of calumny I have begunand now I give my sensual race the reinfit thy consent to my sharp appetitelay by all nicety and prolixious blushesthat banish what they sue for redeem thy brotherby yielding up thy body to my willor else he must not only die the deathbut thy unkindness shall his death draw outto lingering sufferance Answer me to-morrowor by the affection that now guides me mostiull prove a tyrant to him as for yousay what you can my false oerweighs your trueto whom should I complain did I tell thiswho would believe me O perilous mouthsthat bear in them one and the self-same tongueeither of condemnation or approofbidding the law make curtsy to their willhooking both right and wrong to th appetiteto follow as it draws iull to my brotherthough he hath fallen by prompture of the bloodyet hath he in him such a mind of honourthat had he twenty heads to tender downon twenty bloody blocks heed yield them upbefore his sister should her body stoopto such abhorred pollutionthen Isabel live chaste and brother diemore than our brother is our chastityiull tell him yet of Angelos requestand fit his mind to death for his souls restso then you hope of pardon from lord Angelothe miserable have no other medinebut only hopeI have hope to live and am prepared to diebe absolute for death either death or lifeshall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with lifeif I do lose thee I do lose a thingthat none but fools would keep a breath thou artservile to all the skyey influencesthat dost this habitation where thou keepesthourly afflict Merely thou art deaths foolfor him thou labourest by thy flight to shunand yet runest toward him still thou art not noblefor all th accommodations that thou bearestare nursed by baseness thou art by no means valiantfor thou dost fear the soft and tender forkof a poor worm thy best of rest is sleepand that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearestthy death which is no more thou art not thyselffor thou existest on many a thousand grainsthat issue out of dust Happy thou art notfor what thou hast not still thou strivest to getand what thou hast forgetest thou art not certainfor thy complexion shifts to strange effectsafter the moon if thou art rich thourt poorfor like an ass whose back with ingots bowsthou bearest thy heavy riches but a journeyand death unloads thee friend hast thou nonefor thine own bowels which do call thee sirethe mere effusion of thy proper loinsdo curse the gout serpigo and the rheumfor ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor agebut as it were an after-dinners sleepdreaming on both for all thy blessed youthbecomes as aged and doth beg the almsof palsied eld and when thou art old and richthou hast neither heat affection limb nor beautyto make thy riches pleasant whats yet in thisthat bears the name of life yet in this lifelie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fearthat makes these odds all evenI humbly thank youto sue to live I find I seek to dieand seeking death find life let it come onwhat ho peace here grace and good companywhos there come in the wish deserves a welcomedear sir ere long iull visit you againmost holy sir I thank youmy business is a word or two with Claudioand very welcome look signior heres your sisterprovost a word with youas many as you pleasebring me to hear them speak where I may be concealednow sister whats the comfortwhy as all comforts are most good most good indeedlord Angelo having affairs to heavenintends you for his swift ambassadorwhere you shall be an everlasting leigertherefore your best appointment make with speedto-morrow you set onis there no remedynone but such remedy as to save a headto cleave a heart in twainbut is there anyyes brother you may livethere is a devilish mercy in the judgeif youll implore it that will free your lifebut fetter you till deathperpetual duranceay just perpetual durance a restraintthough all the worlds vastidity you hadto a determined scopebut in what naturein such a one as you consenting toitwould bark your honour from that trunk you bearand leave you nakedlet me know the pointO I do fear thee Claudio and I quakelest thou a feverous life shouldst entertainand six or seven winters more respectthan a perpetual honour Darest thou diethe sense of death is most in apprehensionand the poor beetle that we tread uponin corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatas when a giant dieswhy give you me this shamethink you I can a resolution fetchfrom flowery tenderness if I must dieI will encounter darkness as a brideand hug it in mine armsthere spake my brother there my fathers gravedid utter forth a voice yes thou must diethou art too noble to conserve a lifein base appliances this outward-sainted deputywhose settled visage and deliberate wordnips youth inthe head and follies doth enmewas falcon doth the fowl is yet a devilhis filth within being cast he would appeara pond as deep as hellthe prenzie AngeloO itis the cunning livery of hellthe damnedest body to invest and coverin prenzie guards dost thou think Claudioif I would yield him my virginitythou mightst be freedO heavens it cannot beyes he would givet thee from this rank offenceso to offend him still this nights the timethat I should do what I abhor to nameor else thou diest to-morrowthou shalt not doitO were it but my lifeied throw it down for your deliveranceas frankly as a pinthanks dear Isabelbe ready Claudio for your death to-morrowyes Has he affections in himthat thus can make him bite the law by the nosewhen he would force it Sure it is no sinor of the deadly seven it is the leastwhich is the leastif it were damnable he being so wisewhy would he for the momentary trickbe perdurably fined O Isabelwhat says my brotherdeath is a fearful thingand shamed life a hatefulay but to die and go we know not whereto lie in cold obstruction and to rotthis sensible warm motion to becomea kneaded clod and the delighted spiritto bathe in fiery floods or to residein thrilling region of thick-ribbed iceto be imprisoned in the viewless windsand blown with restless violence round aboutthe pendant world or to be worse than worstof those that lawless and incertain thoughtsimagine howling itis too horriblethe weariest and most loathed worldly lifethat age ache penury and imprisonmentcan lay on nature is a paradiseto what we fear of deathalas alassweet sister let me livewhat sin you do to save a brothers lifenature dispenses with the deed so farthat it becomes a virtueO you beastO faithless coward O dishonest wretchwilt thou be made a man out of my viceisit not a kind of incest to take lifefrom thine own sisters shame what should I thinkheaven shield my mother played my father fairfor such a warped slip of wildernessneer issued from his blood take my defiancedie perish Might but my bending downreprieve thee from thy fate it should proceediull pray a thousand prayers for thy deathno word to save theenay hear me IsabelO fie fie fiethy sins not acdental but a trademercy to thee would prove itself a bawditis best that thou diest quicklyO hear me Isabellavouchsafe a word young sister but one wordwhat is your willmight you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefitI have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you a whileson I have overheard what hath past between you and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible to-morrow you must die go to your knees and make readylet me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of ithold you there farewellprovost a word with youwhats your will fatherthat now you are come you will be gone Leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my companyin good timethe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo how would you do to content this substitute and to save your brotherI am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but O how much is the good duke deceived in Angelo if ever he return and I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his governmentthat shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this businesslet me hear you speak further I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spiritvirtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at seaI have heard of the lady and good words went with her nameshe should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was wracked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage-dowry with both her combinate husband this well-seeming Angelocan this be so did Angelo so leave herleft her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents notwhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she availit is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing itshow me how good fatherthis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason

Pompey hacome your ways sir comeyou will not bail me then sirthen Pompey nor now what news abroad friar what newscome your ways sir comego to kennel Pompey gowhat news friar of the dukeI know none can you tell me of anysome say he is with the emperor of Russia other some he is in Rome but where is he think youI know not where but wheresoever I wish him wellit was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression toithe does well inita little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friarit is too general a vice and severity must cure ityes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think youhow should he be made thensome report a sea-maid spawned him some that he was begot between two stock-fishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that I know to be true and he is a motion generative thats infallibleyou are pleasant sir and speak apacewhy what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a cod-piece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercyI never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that wayO sir you are deceiveditis not possiblewho not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform youyou do him wrong surelysir I was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawingwhat I prithee might be the causeno pardon itis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this I can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wisewise why no question but he wasa very superfial ignorant unweighing felloweither this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malicesir I know him and I love himlove talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer lovecome sir I know what I knowI can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call upon you and I pray you your namesir my name is Luo well known to the dukehe shall know you better sir if I may live to report youI fear you notO you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed I can do you little harm youll forswear this againiull be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar but no more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or nowhy should he die sirwhy for filling a bottle with a tundish I would the duke we talk of were returned again this ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar I prithee pray for me the duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on Fridays Hes not past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that I said so farewellno might nor greatness in mortalitycan censure scape back-wounding calumnythe whitest virtue strikes what king so strongcan tie the gall up in the slanderous tonguebut who comes herego away with her to prisongood my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merful man good my lorddouble and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind this would make mercy swear and play the tyranta bawd of eleven years continuance may it please your honourmy lord this is one Luos information against me mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the dukes time he promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse methat fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be called before us away with her to prison go to no more wordsprovost my brother Angelo will not be altered Claudio must die to-morrow let him be furnished with divines and have all charitable preparation if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with himso please you this friar hath been with him and advised him for the entertainment of deathgood even good fatherbliss and goodness on youof whence are younot of this country though my chance is nowto use it for my time I am a brotherof gracious order late come from the Seein speal business from his Holinesswhat news abroad inthe worldnone but there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make soeties secure but security enough to make fellowships accursed Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every days news I pray you sir of what disposition was the dukeone that above all other strifes contended espeally to know himselfwhat pleasure was he given torather rejoing to see another merry than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared I am made to understand that you have lent him visitationhe professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to dieyou have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justiceif his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himselfI am going to visit the prisoner fare you wellpeace be with youhe who the sword of heaven will bearshould be as holy as severepattern in himself to knowgrace to stand and virtue gomore nor less to others payingthan by self offences weighingshame to him whose cruel strikingkills for faults of his own likingtwice treble shame on Angeloto weed my vice and let his growO what may man within him hidethough angel on the outward sidehow many likeness made in crimesmaking practice on the timesto draw with idle spiders stringsmost pondrous and substantial thingscraft against vice I must applywith Angelo to-night shall liehis old betrothed but despisedso disguise shall by the disguisedpay with falsehood false exactingand perform an old contractingtake O take those lips awaythat so sweetly were forswornand those eyes the break of daylights that do mislead the mornbut my kisses bring againbring againseals of love but sealed in vainsealed in vainbreak off thy song and haste thee quick awayhere comes a man of comfort whose advicehath often stilled my brawling discontentI cry you mercy sir and well could wishyou had not found me here so musicallet me excuse me and believe me somy mirth it much displeased but pleased my woeitis good though music oft hath such a charmto make bad good and good provoke to harmI pray you tell me hath anybody inquired for me here to-day much upon this time have I promised here to meetyou have not been inquired after I have sat here all dayI do constantly believe you the time is come even now I shall crave your forbearance a little may be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourselfI am always bound to youvery well met and well comewhat is the news from this good deputyhe hath a garden rcummured with brickwhose western side is with a vineyard backedand to that vineyard is a planched gatethat makes his opening with this bigger keythis other doth command a little doorwhich from the vineyard to the garden leadsthere have I made my promiseupon the heavy middle of the nightto call upon himbut shall you on your knowledge find this wayI have taen a due and wary note uponitwith whispering and most guilty diligencein action all of precept he did show methe way

your companion by the handwho hath a story ready for your earI shall attend your leisure but make hastethe vaporous night approacheswillit please you walk asideO place and greatness millions of false eyesare stuck upon thee volumes of reportrun with these false and most contrarious questsupon thy doings thousand escapes of witmake thee the father of their idle dreamand rack thee in their faneswelcome how agreedshell take the enterprise upon her fatherif you advise itit is not my consentbut my entreaty toolittle have you to saywhen you depart from him but soft and lowremember now my brother fear me notnor gentle daughter fear you not at allhe is your husband on a pre-contractto bring you thus together itis no sinsith that the justice of your title to himdoth flourish the deceit come let us goour corns to reap for yet our tithes to sowcome hither sirrah can you cut off a mans headif the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a married man he

mysterypainting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging if I should be hanged I cannot imaginesir it is a mysteryproofevery true mans apparel fits your thiefif it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true mans apparel fits your thiefare you agreedsir I will serve him for I do find that your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth often ask forgivenessyou sirrah provide your block and your axe to-morrow four oclockcome on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade followI do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you a good turncall hither Barnardine and Claudiothe one has my pity not a jot the otherbeing a murderer though he were my brotherlook heres the warrant Claudio for thy deathitis now dead midnight and by eight to-morrowthou must be made immortal wheres Barnardineas fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labourwhen it lies starkly in the travellers boneshe will not wakewho can do good on himwell go prepare yourselfbut hark what noiseheaven give your spirits comfortby and byI hope it is some pardon or reprievefor the most gentle Claudiowelcome fatherthe best and wholesomest spirits of the nightenvelop you good provost who called here of latenone since the curfew rungnot Isabelnothey will then eret be longwhat comfort is for Claudiotheres some in hopeit is a bitter deputynot so not so his life is paralleledeven with the stroke and line of his great justicehe doth with holy abstinence subduethat in himself which he spurs on his powerto qualify in others were he mealed with thatwhich he corrects then were he tyrannousbut this being so hes justnow are they comethis is a gentle provost seldom whenthe steeled gaoler is the friend of menhow now what noise that spirits possessed with hastethat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokesthere he must stay until the officerarise to let him in he is called uphave you no countermand for Claudio yetbut he must die to-morrownone sir noneas near the dawning provost as it isyou shall hear more ere morninghappilyyou something know yet I believe there comesno countermand no such example have webesides upon the very siege of justicelord Angelo hath to the public earprofessed the contrarythis is his lordships manand here comes Claudios pardonmy lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other rcumstance Good morrow for as I take it it is almost dayI shall obey himthis is his pardon purchased by such sinfor which the pardoner himself is inhence hath offence his quick celeritywhen it is borne in high authoritywhen vice makes mercy mercys so extendedthat for the faults love is the offender friendednow sir what newsI told you lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not used it beforepray you lets hearwhatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have Claudios head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your perilwhat say you to this sirwhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed this afternoona Bohemian born but here nursed up and bred one that is a prisoner nine years oldhow came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do sohis friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord Angelo came not to an undoubtful proofit is now apparentmost manifest and not denied by himselfhath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to be toucheda man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortalhe wants advicehe will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at allmore of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if I read it not truly my anent skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angalo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesypray sir in whatin the delaying deathalack how may I do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudios to cross this in the smallestby the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to Angeloangelo hath seen them both and will discover the favourO deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my lifepardon me good father it is against my oathwere you sworn to the duke or to the deputyto him and to his substitutesyou will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealingbut what likelihood is in thatnot a resemblance but a certainty yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to youI know them boththe contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over-read if at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the dukes death perchance his entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with Barnardines head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawnI am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession one would think it were mistress Overdones own house for here be many of

you and pray with youfriar not I I have been drinking hard all night and I will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets I will not consent to die this day thats certainO sir you must and therefore I beseech you look forward on the journey you shall goI swear I will not die to-day for any mans persuasionbut hear younot a word if you have anything to say to me come to my ward for thence will not I to dayunfit to live or die O gravel heartafter him fellows bring him to the blocknow sir how do you find the prisonera creature unprepared unmeet for

headjust of his colour what if we do omitthis reprobate till he were well inclinedand satisfy the deputy with the visageof Ragozine more like to ClaudioO itis an acdent that heaven providesdispatch it presently the hour draws onprefixed by Angelo See this be doneand sent according to command whiles Ipersuade this rude wretch willingly to diethis shall be done good father presentlybut Barnardine must die this afternoonand how shall we continue Claudioto save me from the danger that might comeif he were known alivelet this be doneput them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudioere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingto the under generation you shall findyour safety manifestedI am your free dependantquick dispatchand send the head to Angelonow will I write letters to Angelothe provost he shall bear them whose contentsshall witness to him I am near at homeand that by great injunctions I am boundto enter publicly him iull desireto meet me at the consecrated founta league below the ty and from thenceby cold gradation and well-balanced formwe shall proceed with Angelohere is the head iull carry it myselfconvenient

daughterin your close patienceO I will to him and pluck out his eyesyou shall not be admitted to his sightunhappy Claudio Wretched Isabelinjurious world most damned Angelothis nor hurts him nor profits you a jotforbear it therefore give your cause to heavenmark what I say which you shall findby every syllable a faithful veritythe duke comes home to-morrow nay dry your eyesone of our covent and his confessorgives me this instance already he hath carriednotice to Escalus and Angelowho do prepare to meet him at the gatesthere to give up their power if you can pace your wisdomin that good path that I would wish it goand you shall have your bosom on this wretchgrace of the duke revenges to your heartand general honourI am directed by youthis letter then to Friar Peter giveitis that he sent me of the dukes returnsay by this token I desire his companyat Marianas house to-night her cause and yoursiull perfect him withal and he shall bring youbefore the duke and to the head of Angeloaccuse him home and home for my poor selfI am combined by a sacred vowand shall be absent Wend you with this lettercommand these fretting waters from your eyeswith a light heart trust not my holy orderif I pervert your course whos heregood even Friar where is the provostnot within sirO pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me toit but they say the duke will be here to-morrow by my troth Isabel I loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had livedsir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in themfriar thou knowest not the duke so well as I do hes a better woodman than thou takest him forwell youll answer this one dayfare ye wellnay tarry iull go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the dukeyou have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enoughI was once before him for getting a wench with childdid you such a thingyes marry did I but I was fain

have very little of it nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stickevery letter he hath writ hath disvouched otherin most uneven and distracted mannerhis actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities thereI guess notand why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the streethe shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against uswell I beseech you let it be proclaimedbetimes inthe morn iull call you at your housegive notice to such men of sort and suitas are to meet himI shall sir fare you wellgood nightthis deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnantand dull to all proceedings a deflowered maidand by an eminent body that enforcedthe law against it but that her tender shamewill not proclaim against her maiden losshow might she tongue me yet reason dares her nofor my authority bears so credent bulkthat no particular scandal once can touchbut it confounds the breather he should have livedsave that his riotous youth with dangerous sensemight in the times to come have taen revengeby so receiving a dishonoured lifewith ransom of such shame would yet he had livedalack when once our grace we have forgotnothing goes right we would and we would notthese letters at fit time deliver methe provost knows our purpose and our plotthe matter being afoot keep your instructionand hold you ever to our speal driftthough sometimes you do blench from this to thatas cause doth minister go call at Flavius houseand tell him where I stay give the like noticeto Valentinus Rowland and to Crassusand bid them bring the trumpets to the gatebut send me Flavius firstit shall be speeded wellI thank thee Varrius thou hast made good hastecome we will walk theres other of our friendswill greet us here anon my gentle Varriusto speak so indirectly I am loathI would say the truth but to accuse him sothat is your part yet im advised to do ithe says to veil full purposebe

lord Angelo shall give you justicereveal yourself to himO worthy dukeyou bid me seek redemption of the devilhear me yourself for that which I must speakmust either punish me not being believedor wring redress from you Hear me O hear me heremy lord her wits I fear me are not firmshe hath been a suitor to me for her brothercut off by course of justiceby course of justiceand she will speak most bitterly and strangemost strange but yet most truly will I speakthat Angelos forsworn is it not strangethat Angelos a murderer isit not strangethat Angelo is an adulterous thiefa hypocrite a virgin-violatoris it not strange and strangenay it is ten times strangeit is not truer he is Angelothan this is all as true as it is strangenay it is ten times true for truth is truthto the end of reckoningaway with her poor soulshe speaks this in the infirmity of senseO prince I conjure thee as thou believestthere is another comfort than this worldthat thou neglect me not with that opinionthat I am touched with madness make not impossiblethat which but seems unlike itis not impossiblebut one the wickedest caitiff on the groundmay seem as shy as grave as just as absoluteas Angelo even so may Angeloin all his dressings characts titles formsbe an arch-villain believe it royal princeif he be less hes nothing but hes morehad I more name for badnessby mine honestyif she be mad as I believe no otherher madness hath the oddest frame of sensesuch a dependency of thing on thingas eer I heard in madnessO gracious dukeharp not on that nor do not banish reasonfor inequality but let your reason serveto make the truth appear where it seems hidand hide the false seems truemany that are not madhave sure more lack of reason what would you sayI am the sister of one Claudiocondemned upon the act of fornicationto lose his head condemned by AngeloI in probation of a sisterhoodwas sent to by my brother one Luoas then the messengerthats I ant like your graceI came to her from Claudio and desired herto try her gracious fortune with lord Angelofor her poor brothers pardonthats he indeedyou were not bid to speakno my good lordnor wished to hold my peaceI wish you now thenpray you take note of it and when you havea business for yourself pray heaven you thenbe perfectI warrant your honourthe warrants for yourself take heed to itthis gentleman told somewhat of my talerightit may be right but you are in the wrongto speak before your time proceedI wentto this pernious caitiff deputythats somewhat madly spokenpardon itthe phrase is to the mattermended again the matter proceedin brief to set the needless process byhow I persuaded how I prayed and kneeledhow he refelled me and how I repliedfor this was of much length the vile conclusionI now begin with grief and shame to utterhe would not but by gift of my chaste bodyto his concupisble intemperate lustrelease my brother and after much debatementmy sisterly remorse confutes mine honourand I did yield to him but the next morn betimeshis purpose surfeiting he sends a warrantfor my poor brothers headthis is most likelyO that it were as like as it is trueby heaven fond wretch thou knowest not what thou speakestor else thou art suborned against his honourin hateful practice first his integritystands without blemish next it imports no reasonthat with such vehemency he should pursuefaults proper to himself if he had so offendedhe would have weighed thy brother by himselfand not have cut him off Some one hath set you onconfess the truth and say by whose advicethou camest here to complainand is this allthen O you blessed ministers abovekeep me in patience and with ripened timeunfold the evil which is here wrapt upin countenance Heaven shield your grace from woeas I thus wronged hence unbelieved goI know youed fain be gone An officerto prison with her Shall we thus permita blasting and a scandalous breath to

lordof a strange fever upon his mere requestbeing come to knowledge that there was complaintintended gainst lord Angelo came I hitherto speak as from his mouth what he doth knowis true and false and what he with his oathand all probation will make up full clearwhensoever hes convented first for this womanto justify this worthy noblemanso vulgarly and personally accusedher shall you hear disproved to her eyestill she herself confess itgood friar lets hear itdo you not smile at this lord AngeloO heaven the vanity of wretched foolsgive us some seats come cousin Angeloin this iull

thine this is the bodythat took away the match from Isabeland did supply thee at thy garden-housein her imagined personknow you this womancarnally she sayssirrah no moreenough my lordmy lord I must confess I know this womanand five years since there was some speech of marriagebetwixt myself and her which was broke offpartly for that her promised proportionscame short of composition but

Isabeland now dear maid be you as free to usyour brothers death I know sits at your heartand you may marvel why I obscured myselflabouring to save his life and would not rathermake rash remonstrance of my hidden powerthan let him so be lost O most kind maidit was the swift celerity of his deathwhich I did think with slower foot came onthat brained my purpose but peace be with himthat life is better life past fearing deaththan that which lives to fear make it your comfortso happy is your brotherI do my lordfor this new-married man approaching herewhose salt imagination yet hath wrongedyour well-defended honour you must pardonfor Marianas sake but as he adjudged your brotherbeing criminal in double violationof sacred chastity and of promise-breachthereon dependent for your brothers lifethe very mercy of the law cries outmost audible even from his proper tonguean Angelo for Claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisurelike doth quit like and Measure still for Measurethen Angelo thy faults thus manifestedwhich though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantagewe do condemn thee to the very blockwhere Claudio stooped to death and with like hasteaway with himO my most gracious lordI hope you will not mock me with a husbandit is your husband mocked you with a husbandconsenting to the safeguard of your honourI thought your marriage fit else imputationfor that he knew you might reproach your lifeand choke your good to come for his possessionsalthough by confiscation they are ourswe do instate and widow you withalto buy you a better husbandO my dear lordI crave no other nor no better mannever crave him we are definitivegentle my liegeyou do but lose your labouraway with him to deathnow sir to youO my good lord sweet Isabel take my partlend me your knees and all my life to comeiull lend you all my life to do you serviceagainst all sense you do importune hershould she kneel down in mercy of this facther brothers ghost his paved bed would breakand take her hence in horrorisabelsweet Isabel do yet but kneel by mehold up your hands say nothing iull speak allthey say best men are moulded out of faultsand for the most become much more the betterfor being a little bad so may my husbandO Isabel will you not lend a kneehe dies for Claudios deathmost bounteous sirlook if it please you on this man condemnedas if my brother lived I partly thinka due sincerity governed his deedstill he did look on me since it is solet him not die my brother had but justicein that he did the thing for which he diedfor Angelohis act did not oertake his bad intentand must be buried but as an intentthat perished by the way Thoughts are no subjectsintents but merely thoughtsmerely my lordyour suits unprofitable stand up I sayI have bethought me of another faultprovost how came it Claudio was beheadedat an unusual hourit was commanded sohad you a speal warrant for the deedno my good lord it was by private messagefor which I do discharge you of your officegive up your keyspardon me noble lordI thought it was a fault but knew it notyet did repent me after more advicefor testimony whereof one in the prisonthat should by private order else have diedI have reserved alivewhats hehis name is BarnardineI would thou hadst done so by Claudiogo fetch him hither let me look upon himI am sorry one so learned and so wiseas you lord Angelo have still appearedshould slip so grossly both in the heat of bloodand lack of tempered judgment afterwardI am sorry that such sorrow I procureand so deep sticks it in my penitent heartthat I crave death more willingly than mercyitis my deserving and I do entreat itwhich is that Barnardinethis my lordthere was a friar told me of this mansirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soulthat apprehends no further than this worldand squarest thy life according Thourt condemnedbut for those earthly faults I quit them alland pray thee take this mercy to providefor better times to come Friar advise himI leave him to your hand what muffled fellows thatthis is another prisoner that I savedthat should have died when Claudio lost his headas like almost to Claudio as himselfif he be like your brother for his sakeis he pardoned and for your lovely sakegive me your hand and say you will be minehe is my brother too but fitter time for thatby this lord Angelo perceives hes safemethinks I see a quickening in his eyewell Angelo your evil quits you welllook that you love your wife her worth worth yoursI find an apt remission in myselfand yet heres one in place I cannot pardonyou sirrah that knew me for a fool a cowardone all of luxury an ass a madmanwherein have I so deserved of youthat you extol me thusfaith my lord I spoke it but according to the trick if you will hang me for it you may but I had rather it would please you I might be whippedwhipped first sir and hanged afterproclaim it provost round about the tyif any womans wronged by this lewd fellowas I have heard him swear himself theres onewhom he begot with child let her appearand he shall marry her the nuptial finishedlet him be whipped and hangedI beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore your highness said even now I made you a duke good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckoldupon mine honour thou shalt marry herthy slanders I forgive and therewithalremit thy other forfeits take him to prisonand see our pleasure herein executedmarrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hangingslandering a prince deserves itshe Claudio that you wronged look you restorejoy to you Mariana love her AngeloI have confessed her and I know her virtuethanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodnesstheres more behind that is more gratulatethanks provost for thy care and secrecywe shall employ thee in a worthier placeforgive him Angelo that brought you homethe head of Ragozine for Claudiosthe offence pardons itself dear IsabelI have a motion much imports your goodwhereto if youll a willing ear inclinewhats mine is yours and what is yours is mineso bring us to our palace where well showwhats yet behind thats meet you all should knowmuch AdO About NothingI learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messinahe is very near by this he was not three leagues off when I left himhow many gentlemen have you lost in this actionbut few of any sort and none of namea victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudiomuch deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you howhe hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of itI have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitternessdid he break out into tearsin great measurea kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weepingI pray you is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or noI know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sortwhat is he that you ask for niecemy cousin means Signior Benedick of PaduaO he is returned and as pleasant as ever he washe set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt I pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed I promised to eat all of his killingfaith niece you tax Signior Benedick too much but hell be meet with you I doubt it nothe hath done good service lady in these warsyou had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomachand a good soldier too ladyand a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lorda lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtuesit is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing well we are all mortalyou must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her they never meet but theres a skirmish of wit between themalas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brotherisit possiblevery easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next blockI see lady the gentleman is not in your booksno an he were I would burn my study but I pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devilhe is most in the company of the right noble ClaudioO lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad God help the noble Claudio if he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be curedI will hold friends with you ladydo good friendyou will never run mad nieceno not till a hot Januarydon Pedro is approachedgood Signior Leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter itnever came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leaveyou embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your daughterher mother hath many times told me sowere you in doubt sir that you asked hersignior Benedick no for then you were a childyou have it full Benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man truly the lady fathers herself be happy lady for you are like an honourable fatherif Signior Leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she isI wonder that you will still be talking Signior Benedick nobody marks youwhat my dear Lady Disdain are you yet livingis it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presencethen is courtesy a turncoat but it is certain I am loved of all ladies only you excepted and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love nonea dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernious suitor I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves megod keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched facescratching could not make it worse an itwere such a face as yours werewell you are a rare parrot-teachera bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yoursI would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer but keep your way in Gods name I have doneyou always end with a jades trick I know you of oldthis is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heartif you swear my lord you shall not be forswornlet me bid you welcome my lord being reconled to the prince your brother I owe you all dutyI thank you I am not of many words but I thank youplease it your grace lead onyour hand Leonato we will go togetherbenedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior LeonatoI noted her not but I looked on heris she not a modest young ladydo you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sexno I pray thee speak in sober judgmentwhy infaith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like herthou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest herwould you buy her that you inquire after hercan the world buy such a jewelyea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the songin mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked onI can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter theres her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December but I hope you have no intent to turn husband have youI would scarce trust myself though I had sworn to the contrary if Hero would be my wifeisit come to this infaith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspion Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again go to infaith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays look Don Pedro is returned to seek youwhat secret hath held you here that you followed not to LeonatosI would your grace would constrain me to tellI charge thee on thy allegianceyou hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love With who now that is your graces part mark how short his answer is with Hero Leonatos short daughterif this were so so were it utteredlike the old tale my lord itis not so nor itwas not so but indeed God forbid it should be so if my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be otherwiseamen if you love her for the lady is very well worthyyou speak this to fetch me in my lordby my troth I speak my thoughtand in faith my lord I spoke mineand by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke minethat I love her I feelthat she is worthy I knowthat I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stakethou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beautyand never could maintain his part but in the force of his willthat a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which I may go the finer I will live a bachelorI shall see thee ere I die look pale with lovewith anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad-makers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupidwell if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argumentif I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adamwell as time shall tryin time the savage bull doth bear the yoke the savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see Benedick the married man if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn-madnay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou wilt quake for this shortlyI look for an earthquake too thenwell you will temporize with the hours in the meantime good Signior Benedick repair to Leonatos commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparationI have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so I commit youto the tuition of God from my house if I had itthe sixth of July your loving friend Benedicknay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your consence and so I leave youmy liege your highness now may do me goodmy love is thine to teach teach it but howand thou shalt see how apt it is to learnany hard lesson that may do thee goodhath Leonato any son my lordno child but Hero shes his only heirdost thou affect her ClaudioO my lordwhen you went onward on this ended actionI looked upon her with a soldiers eyethat liked but had a rougher task in handthan to drive liking to the name of lovebut now I am returned and that war-thoughtshave left their places vacant in their roomscome thronging soft and delicate desiresall prompting me how fair young Hero issaying I liked her ere I went to warsthou wilt be like a lover presentlyand tire the hearer with a book of wordsif thou dost love fair Hero cherish itand I will break with her and with her fatherand thou shalt have her wast not to this endthat thou beganest to twist so fine a storyhow sweetly do you minister to lovethat know loves grief by his complexionbut lest my liking might too sudden seemI would have salved it with a longer treatisewhat need the bridge much broader than the floodthe fairest grant is the necessitylook what will serve is fit itis once thou lovestand I will fit thee with the remedyI know we shall have revelling to-nightI will assume thy part in some disguiseand tell fair Hero I am Claudioand in her bosom iull unclasp my heartand take her hearing prisoner with the forceand strong encounter of my amorous talethen after to her father will I breakand the conclusion is she shall be thinein practice let us put it presentlyhow now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this musiche is very busy about it but brother I can tell you strange news that you yet dreaint not ofare they goodas the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and Count Claudio walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of ithath the fellow any wit that told you thisa good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourselfno no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true go you and tell her of itcousins you know what you have to do O I cry you mercy friend go you with me and I will use your skill Good cousin have a care this busy timewhat the good-year my lord why are you thus out of measure sadthere is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limityou should hear reasonand when I have heard it what blessing brings itit not a present remedy at least a patient sufferanceI wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art born under Saturn goest about to apply a moral medine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when I have stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no mans business laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humouryea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvestI had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage if I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter mecan you make no use of your discontentI make all use of it for I use it only who comes herewhat news BorachioI came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriagewill it serve for any model to build mischief on what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietnessmarry it is your brothers right handwho the most exquisite Claudioeven hea proper squire and who and who which way looks hemarry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonatoa very forward march-chick how came you to thisbeing entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself and having obtained her give her to Count Claudiocome come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure that young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way I bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist meto the death my lordto the death my lordlet us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that I am subdued would the cook were of my mind Shall we go prove whats to be donewell wait upon your lordshipwas not Count John here at supperI saw him nothow tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour afterhe is of a very melancholy dispositionhe were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattlingthen half Signior Benedicks tongue in Count Johns mouth and half Count Johns melancholy in Signior Benedicks facewith a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her good willby my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tonguein faith shes too cursttoo curst is more than curst I shall lessen Gods sending that way for it is said God sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends noneso by being too curst God will send you no hornsjust if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollenyou may light on a husband that hath no beardwhat should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man I am not for him therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward and lead his apes into hellwell then go you into hellno but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids so deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is longwell niece I trust you will be ruled by your fatheryes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husbandnot till God make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle iull none Adams sons are my brethren and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindreddaughter remember what I told you if the prince do solit you in that kind you know your answerthe fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer for hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a nque-pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly-modest as a measure full of state and anentry and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the nque-pace faster and faster till he sink into his gravecousin you apprehend passing shrewdlyI have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylightthe revellers are entering brother make good roomlady will you walk about with your friendso you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and espeally when I walk awaywith me in your companyI may say so when I pleaseand when please you to say sowhen I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the casemy visor is Philemons roof within the house is Jovewhy then your visor should be thatchedspeak low if you speak lovewell I would you did like meso would not I for your own sake for I have many ill qualitieswhich is oneI say my prayers aloudI love you the better the hearers may cry amengod match me with a good danceramenand God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer clerkno more words the clerk is answeredI know you well enough you are Signior Antonioat a word I am notI know you by the waggling of your headto tell you true I counterfeit himyou could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man heres his dry hand up and down you are he you are heat a word I am notcome come do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to mum you are he graces will appear and theres an endwill you not tell me who told you sono you shall pardon menor will you not tell me who you arenot nowthat I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the Hundred Merry Tales well this was Signior Benedick that said sowhats heI am sure you know him well enoughnot I believe medid he never make you laughI pray you what is hewhy he is the princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded mewhen I know the gentleman iull tell him what you saydo do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that nightwe must follow the leadersin every good thingnay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turningsure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remainsand that is Claudio I know him by his bearingare you not Signior Benedickyou know me well I am hesignior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on Hero I pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in ithow know you he loves herI heard him swear his affectionso did I too and he swore he would marry her to-nightcome let us to the banquetthus answer I in name of Benedickbut hear these ill news with the ears of Claudioitis certain so the prince woos for himselffriendship is constant in all other thingssave in the office and affairs of lovetherefore all hearts in love use their own tongueslet every eye negotiate for itselfand trust no agent for beauty is a witchagainst whose charms faith melteth into bloodthis is an acdent of hourly proofwhich I mistrusted not farewell therefore Herocount Claudioyea the samecome will you go with mewhithereven to the next willow about your own business count what fashion will you wear the garland of About your neck like a usurers chain or under your arm like a lieutenants scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your HeroI wish him joy of herwhy thats spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thusI pray you leave meho now you strike like the blind man itwas the boy that stole your meat and youll beat the postif it will not be iull leave youalas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady Beatrice should know me and not know me the princes fool Ha it may be I go under that title because I am merry yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well iull be revenged as I maynow signior wheres the count did you see himtroth my lord I have played the part of Lady fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I think I told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and I offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whippedto be whipped whats his faultthe flat transgression of a school-boy who being overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals itwilt thou make a trust a transgression the transgression is in the stealeryet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as I take it have stolen his birds nestI will but teach them to sing and restore them to the ownerif their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestlythe Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by youO she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking I had been myself that I was the princes jester that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made Hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follow herlook here she comeswill your grace command me any service to the worlds end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia bring you the length of Prester Johns foot fetch you a hair off the great Chams beard do you any embassage to the Pigmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for menone but to desire your good companyO God sir heres a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady tonguecome lady come you have lost the heart of Signior Benedickindeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say I have lost ityou have put him down lady you have put him downso I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio whom you sent me to seekwhy how now count wherefore are you sadnot sad my lordhow then Sickneither my lordthe count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexioninfaith lady I think your blazon to be true though iull be sworn if he be so his conceit is false here Claudio I have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and God give thee joycount take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to itspeak count itis your cuesilence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchangespeak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neitherin faith lady you have a merry heartyea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heartand so she doth cousingood lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but I and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husbandlady Beatrice I will get you oneI would rather have one of your fathers getting hath your grace neer a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by themwill you have me ladyno my lord unless I might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day but I beseech your grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matteryour silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hourno sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was I born Cousins God give you joyniece will you look to those things I told you ofI cry you mercy uncle by your graces pardonby my troth a pleasant-spirited ladytheres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughingshe cannot endure to hear tell of a husbandO by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suitshe were an excellent wife for BenedickO lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves madcount Claudio when mean you to go to churchto-morrow my lord Time goes on crutches till love have all his ritesnot till Monday my dear son which is hence a just seven-night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mindcome you shake the head at so long a breathing but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules labours which is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you directionmy lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights watchingsand I my lordand you too gentle HeroI will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husbandand Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I with your two helps will so practise on Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice if we can do this Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love-gods go in with me and I will tell you my driftit is so the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonatoyea my lord but I can cross itany bar any cross any impediment will be medinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriagenot honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in meshow me briefly howI think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favour of Margaret the waiting-gentlewoman to HeroI rememberI can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber-windowwhat life is in that to be the death of this marriagethe poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as Herowhat proof shall I make of thatproof enough to misuse the prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonatolook you for any other issueonly to despite them I will endeavour any thinggo then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio as in love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window hear me call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of Heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrowngrow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in practice be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducatsbe you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame meI will presently go learn their day of marriageboysigniorin my chamber-window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchardI am here already sirI know that but I would have thee hence and here again [exit boy ] I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthographer his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but iull take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be thats certain wise or iull none virtuous or iull never cheapen her fair or iull never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent musian and her hair shall be of what colour it please God Ha the prince and Monsieur love I will hide me in the arbourcome shall we hear this musicyea my good lord how still the evening isas hushed on purpose to grace harmonysee you where Benedick hath hid himselfO very well my lord the music endedwell fit the kid-fox with a penny-worthcome Balthazar well hear that song againO good my lord tax not so bad a voiceto slander music any more than onceit is the witness still of excellencyto put a strange face on his own perfectionI pray thee sing and let me woo no morebecause you talk of wooing I will singsince many a wooer doth commence his suitto her he thinks not worthy yet he woosyet will he swear he lovesnay pray thee comeor if thou wilt hold longer argumentdo it in notesnote this before my notestheres not a note of mine thats worth the notingwhy these are very crotchets that he speaksnotes notes forsooth and nothingnow divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies well a horn for my money when alls donesigh no more ladies sigh no moremen were deceivers everone foot in sea and one on shoreto one thing constant neverthen sigh not sobut let them goand be you blithe and bonnyconverting all your sounds of woeinto Hey nonny nonnysing no more ditties sing no moof dumps so dull and heavythe fraud of men was ever sosince summer first was leavythen sigh not sobut let them goand be you blithe and bonnyconverting all your sounds of woeinto Hey nonny nonnyby my troth a good songand an ill singer my lordha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shiftan he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief I had as lief have heard the night-raven come what plague could have come after ityea marry dost thou hear Balthazar I pray thee get us some excellent music for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Heros chamber-windowthe best I can my lorddo so farewellcome hither Leonato what was it you told me of to-day that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior BenedickO aystalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did never think that lady would have loved any manno nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhorisit possible Sits the wind in that cornerby my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thoughtmay be she doth but counterfeitfaith like enoughO God counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers itwhy what effects of passion shows shebait the hook well this fish will bitewhat effects my lord she will sit youyou heard my daughter tell you howshe did indeedhow how I pray you you amaze me I would have thought her spirit had been invinble against all assaults of affectionI would have sworn it had my lord espeally against BenedickI should think this a gull but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverencehe hath taen the infection hold it uphath she made her affection known to Benedickno and swears she never will thats her tormentitis true indeed so your daughter says Shall I says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that I love him this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us allnow you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us ofO when she had writ it and was reading it over she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheetthatO she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her I measure him says she by my own spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me yea though I love him I should then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses O sweet Benedick God give me patience she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very trueit were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover itto what end he would but make a sport of it and torment the poor lady worsean he should it were an alms to hang him Shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspion she is virtuousand she is exceeding wisein everything but in loving BenedickO my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardianI would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what a will saywere it good think youhero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossnessshe doth well if she should make tender of her love itis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirithe is a very proper manhe hath indeed a good outward happinessfore God and in my mind very wisehe doth indeed show some sparks that are like witand I take him to be valiantas Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christian-like fearif he do fear God a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and tremblingand so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her lovenever tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counselnay thats impossible she may wear her heart out firstwell we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy to have so good a ladymy lord will you walk dinner is readyif he do not dote on her upon this I will never trust my expectationlet there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that I would see which will be merely a dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinnerthis can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from Hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair itis a truth I can bear them witness and virtuous itis so I cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live till I were married here comes Beatrice by this day shes a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in heragainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinnerfair Beatrice I thank you for your painsI took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful I would not have comeyou take pleasure then in the messageyea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you wellha Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks if I do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I am a Jew I will go get her picturegood Margaret run thee to the parlourthere shalt thou find my cousin Beatriceproposing with the prince and Claudiowhisper her ear and tell her I and Ursulawalk in the orchard and our whole discourseis all of her say that thou overheardest usand bid her steal into the pleached bowerwhere honey-suckles ripened by the sunforbid the sun to enter like favouritesmade proud by princes that advance their prideagainst that power that bred it there will she hide herto listen our propose this is thy officebear thee well in it and leave us aloneiull make her come I warrant you presentlynow Ursula when Beatrice doth comeas we do trace this alley up and downour talk must only be of Benedickwhen I do name him let it be thy partto praise him more than ever man did meritmy talk to thee must be how Benedickis sick in love with Beatrice of this matteris little Cupids crafty arrow madethat only wounds by hearsaynow beginfor look where Beatrice like a lapwing runsclose by the ground to hear our conferencethe pleasantest angling is to see the fishcut with her golden oars the silver streamand greedily devour the treacherous baitso angle we for Beatrice who even nowis couched in the woodbine coverturefear you not my part of the dialoguethen go we near her that her ear lose nothingof the false sweet bait that we lay for itno truly Ursula she is too disdainfulI know her spirits are as coy and wildas haggerds of the rockbut are you surethat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirelyso says the prince and my new-trothed lordand did they bid you tell her of it madamthey did entreat me to acquaint her of itbut I persuaded them if they loved Benedickto wish him wrestle with affectionand never to let Beatrice know of itwhy did you so doth not the gentlemandeserve as full as fortunate a bedas ever Beatrice shall couch uponO god of love I know he doth deserveas much as may be yielded to a manbut nature never framed a womans heartof prouder stuff than that of Beatricedisdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyesmisprising what they look on and her witvalues itself so highly that to herall matter else seems weak she cannot lovenor take no shape nor project of affectionshe is so self-endearedsure I think soand therefore certainly it were not goodshe knew his love lest she make sport at itwhy you speak truth I never yet saw manhow wise how noble young how rarely featuredbut she would spell him backward if fair-facedshe would swear the gentleman should be her sisterif black why nature drawing of an antickmade a foul blot if tall a lance ill-headedif low an agate very vilely cutif speaking why a vane blown with all windsif silent why a block moved with noneso turns she every man the wrong side outand never gives to truth and virtue thatwhich simpleness and merit purchasethsure sure such carping is not commendableno not to be so odd and from all fashionsas Beatrice is cannot be commendablebut who dare tell her so if I should speakshe would mock me into air O she would laugh meout of myself press me to death with wittherefore let Benedick like covered fireconsume away in sighs waste inwardlyit were a better death than die with mockswhich is as bad as die with ticklingyet tell her of it hear what she will sayno rather I will go to Benedickand counsel him to fight against his passionand truly iull devise some honest slandersto stain my cousin with one doth not knowhow much an ill word may empoison likingO do not do your cousin such a wrongshe cannot be so much without true judgmenthaving so swift and excellent a witas she is prized to have as to refuseso rare a gentleman as Signior Benedickhe is the only man of Italyalways excepted my dear ClaudioI pray you be not angry with me madamspeaking my fancy Signior Benedickfor shape for bearing argument and valourgoes foremost in report through Italyindeed he hath an excellent good namehis excellence did earn it ere he had itwhen are you married madamwhy every day to-morrow come go iniull show thee some attires and have thy counselwhich is the best to furnish me to-morrowshes limed I warrant you we have caught her madamif it prove so then loving goes by hapssome Cupid kills with arrows some with trapswhat fire is in mine ears can this be truestand I condemned for pride and scorn so muchcontempt farewell and maiden pride adieuno glory lives behind the back of suchand Benedick love on I will requite theetaming my wild heart to thy loving handif thou dost love my kindness shall inte theeto bind our loves up in a holy bandfor others say thou dost deserve and Ibelieve it better than reportinglyI do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Arragoniull bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe menay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaksgallants I am not as I have beenso say I methinks you are sadderI hope he be in lovehang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants moneyI have the tooth-achedraw ithang ityou must hang it first and draw it afterwardswhat sigh for the tooth-achewhere is but a humour or a wormwell every one can master a grief but he that has ityet say I he is in lovethere is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a Dutchman to-day a Frenchman to-morrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he isif he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bodehath any man seen him at the barbersno but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-ballsindeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beardnay a rubs himself with vet can you smell him out by thatthats as much as to say the sweet youths in lovethe greatest note of it is his melancholyand when was he wont to wash his faceyea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say of himnay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute-string and new-governed by stopsindeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude he is in lovenay but I know who loves himthat would I know too I warrant one that knows him notyes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for himshe shall be buried with her face upwardsyet is this no charm for the tooth-acheold signior walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby-horses must not hearfor my life to break with him about Beatriceitis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meetmy lord and brother God save yougood den brotherif your leisure served I would speak with youin privateif it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns himwhats the mattermeans your lordship to be married to-morrowyou know he doesI know not that when he knows what I knowif there be any impediment I pray you discover ityou may think I love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest for my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowedwhy whats the matterI came hither to tell you and rcumstances shortened for she hath been too long a talking of the lady is disloyalwho Heroeven she Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Herodisloyalthe words too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me to-night you shall see her chamber-window entered even the night before her wedding-day if you love her then to-morrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mindmay this be soI will not think itif you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordinglyif I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame herand as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace herI will disparage her no further till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itselfO day untowardly turnedO mischief strangely thwartingO plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequelare you good men and trueyea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soulnay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watchwell give them their charge neighbour Dogberryfirst who think you the most desartless man to be constablehugh Oatcake sir or George Seacoal for they can write and readcome hither neighbour Seacoal God hath blessed you with a good name to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by natureboth which master constableyou have I knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes namehow if a will not standwhy then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knaveif he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the princes subjectstrue and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be enduredwe will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watchwhy you speak like an anent and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bedhow if they will notwhy then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them forwell sirif you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honestyif we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on himtruly by your office you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your companyyou have been always called a merful man partnertruly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in himif you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still ithow if the nurse be asleep and will not hear uswhy then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleatsitis very truethis is the end of the charge you constable are to present the princes own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay himnay by r lady that I think a cannotfive shillings to one onit with any man that knows the statues he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his willby r lady I think it be soha ah ha well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night come neighbourwell masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two and then all go to bedone word more honest neighbours I pray you watch about Signior Leonatos door for the wedding being there to-morrow there is a great coil to-night Adieu be vigitant I beseech youwhat Conradepeace stir notconrade I sayhere man I am at thy elbowmass and my elbow itched I thought there would a scab followI will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy talestand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to theesome treason masters yet stand closetherefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducatsis it possible that any villany should be so dearthou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they willI wonder at itthat shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a manyes it is apparelI mean the fashionyes the fashion is the fashiontush I may as well say the fools the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion isI know that Deformed a has been a vile thief this seven years a goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his namedidst thou not hear somebodyno itwas the vane on the houseseest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty sometime fashioning them like Pharaohs soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god Bels priests in the old church-window sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry where his cod-piece seems as massy as his cluball this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashionnot so neither but know that I have to-night wooed Margaret the Lady Heros gentlewoman by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress chamber-window bids me a thousand times good night I tell this tale vilely I should first tell thee how the prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounterand thought they Margaret was Herotwo of them did the prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that Don John had made away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husbandwe charge you in the princes name standcall up the right master constable we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealthand one Deformed is one of them I know him a wears a lockmasters mastersyoull be made bring Deformed forth I warrant youmastersnever speak we charge you let us obey you to go with uswe are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these

the gaolcome Friar Frans be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwardsyou come hither my lord to marry this ladynoto be married to her friar you come to marry herlady you come hither to be married to this countI doif either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined I charge you on your souls to utter itknow you any Heronone my lordknow you any countI dare make his answer noneO what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they dohow now Interjections why then some be of laughing as ah ha hestand thee by friar father by your leavewill you with free and unconstrained soulgive me this maid your daughteras freely son as God did give her meand what have I to give you back whose worthmay counterpoise this rich and precious giftnothing unless you render her againsweet prince you learn me noble thankfulnessthere Leonato take her back againgive not this rotten orange to your friendshes but the sign and semblance of her honourbehold how like a maid she blushes hereO what authority and show of truthcan cunning sin cover itself withalcomes not that blood as modest evidenceto witness simple virtue would you not swearall you that see her that she were a maidby these exterior shows but she is noneshe knows the heat of a luxurious bedher blush is guiltiness not modestywhat do you mean my lordnot to be marriednot to knit my soul to an approved wantondear my lord if you in your own proofhave vanquished the resistance of her youthand made defeat of her virginityI know what you would say if I have known heryoull say she did embrace me as a husbandand so extenuate the forehand sinno LeonatoI never tempted her with word too largebut as a brother to his sister showedbashful sincerity and comely loveand seemed I ever otherwise to youout on thee Seeming I will write against ityou seem to me as Dian in her orbas chaste as is the bud ere it be blownbut you are more intemperate in your bloodthan Venus or those pampered animalsthat rage in savage sensualityis my lord well that he doth speak so widesweet prince why speak not youwhat should I speakI stand dishonoured that have gone aboutto link my dear friend to a common staleare these things spoken or do I but dreamsir they are spoken and these things are truethis looks not like a nuptialtrue O Godleonato stand I hereis this the prince is this the princes brotheris this face Heros are our eyes our ownall this is so but what of this my lordlet me but move one question to your daughterand by that fatherly and kindly powerthat you have in her bid her answer trulyI charge thee do so as thou art my childO God defend me how am I besetwhat kind of catechizing call you thisto make you answer truly to your nameis it not Hero who can blot that namewith any just reproachmarry that can Herohero itself can blot out Heros virtuewhat man was he talked with you yesternightout at your window betwixt twelve and onenow if you are a maid answer to thisI talked with no man at that hour my lordwhy then are you no maiden LeonatoI am sorry you must hear upon mine honourmyself my brother and this grieved countdid see her hear her at that hour last nighttalk with a ruffian at her chamber-windowwho hath indeed most like a liberal villainconfessed the vile encounters they have hada thousand times in secretfie fie they are not to be named my lordnot to be spoke ofthere is not chastity enough in languagewithout offence to utter them thus pretty ladyI am sorry for thy much misgovernmentO Hero what a Hero hadst thou beenif half thy outward graces had been placedabout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heartbut fare thee well most foul most fair farewellthou pure impiety and impious purityfor thee iull lock up all the gates of loveand on my eyelids shall conjecture hangto turn all beauty into thoughts of harmand never shall it more be gracioushath no mans dagger here a point for mewhy how now cousin wherefore sink you downcome let us go these things come thus to lightsmother her spirits uphow doth the ladydead I think help unclehero why Hero uncle Signior BenedickfriarO fate take not away thy heavy handdeath is the fairest cover for her shamethat may be wished forhow now cousin Herohave comfort ladydost thou look upyea wherefore should she notwherefore why doth not every earthly thingcry shame upon her could she here denythe story that is printed in her blooddo not live Hero do not ope thine eyesfor did I think thou wouldst not quickly diethought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shamesmyself would on the rearward of reproachesstrike at thy life Grieved I I had but onechid I for that at frugal natures frameO one too much by thee why had I onewhy ever wast thou lovely in mine eyeswhy had I not with charitable handtook up a beggars issue at my gateswho smirched thus and mired with infamyI might have said no part of it is minethis shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine I loved and mine I praisedand mine that I was proud on mine so muchthat I myself was to myself not minevaluing of her why she O she is falleninto a pit of ink that the wide seahath drops too few to wash her clean againand salt too little which may season giveto her foul-tainted fleshsir sir be patientfor my part I am so attired in wonderI know not what to sayO on my soul my cousin is beliedlady were you her bedfellow last nightno truly not although until last nightI have this twelvemonth been her bedfellowconfirmed confirmed O that is stronger madewhich was before barred up with ribs of ironwould the two princes lie and Claudio liewho loved her so that speaking of her foulnesswashed it with tears hence from her let her diehear me a littlefor I have only been silent so longand given way unto this course of fortuneby noting of the lady I have markeda thousand blushing apparitionsto start into her face a thousand innocent shamesin angel whiteness bear away those blushesand in her eye there hath appeared a fireto burn the errors that these princess holdagainst her maiden truth call me a fooltrust not my reading nor my observationswhich with experimental seal doth warrantthe tenour of my book trust not my agemy reverence calling nor divinityif this sweet lady lie not guiltless hereunder some biting errorfriar it cannot bethou seest that all the grace that she hath leftis that she will not add to her damnationa sin of perjury she not denies itwhy seekest thou then to cover with excusethat which appears in proper nakednesslady what man is he you are accused ofthey know that do accuse me I know noneif I know more of any man alivethan that which maiden modesty doth warrantlet all my sins lack mercy O my fatherprove you that any man with me conversedat hours unmeet or that I yesternightmaintained the change of words with any creaturerefuse me hate me torture me to deaththere is some strange misprision in the princestwo of them have the very bent of honourand if their wisdoms be misled in thisthe practice of it lives in John the bastardwhose spirits toil in frame of villaniesI know not if they speak but truth of herthese hands shall tear her if they wrong her honourthe proudest of them shall well hear of ittime hath not yet so dried this blood of minenor age so eat up my inventionnor fortune made such havoc of my meansnor my bad life reft me so much of friendsbut they shall find awaked in such a kindboth strength of limb and policy of mindability in means and choice of friendsto quit me of them throughlypause awhileand let my counsel sway you in this caseyour daughter here the princes left for deadlet her awhile be secretly kept inand publish it that she is dead indeedmaintain a mourning ostentationand on your familys old monumenthang mournful epitaphs and do all ritesthat appertain unto a burialwhat shall become of this what will this domarry this well carried shall on her behalfchange slander to remorse that is some goodbut not for that dream I on this strange coursebut on this travail look for greater birthshe dying as it must be so maintainedupon the instant that she was accusedshall be lamented pitied and excusedof every hearer for it so falls outthat what we have we prize not to the worthwhiles we enjoy it but being lacked and lostwhy then we rack the value then we findthe virtue that possession would not show uswhiles it was ours so will it fare with Claudiowhen he shall hear she died upon his wordsthe idea of her life shall sweetly creepinto his study of imaginationand every lovely organ of her lifeshall come apparelled in more precious habitmore moving-delicate and full of lifeinto the eye and prospect of his soulthan when she lived indeed then shall he mournif ever love had interest in his liverand wish he had not so accused herno though he thought his accusation truelet this be so and doubt not but successwill fashion the event in better shapethan I can lay it down in likelihoodbut if all aim but this be levelled falsethe supposition of the ladys deathwill quench the wonder of her infamyand if it sort not well you may conceal heras best befits her wounded reputationin some reclusive and religious lifeout of all eyes tongues minds and injuriessignior Leonato let the friar advise youand though you know my inwardness and loveis very much unto the prince and Claudioyet by mine honour I will deal in thisas secretly and justly as your soulshould with your bodybeing that I flow in griefthe smallest twine may lead meitis well consented presently awayfor to strange sores strangely they strain the curecome lady die to live this wedding dayperhaps is but prolonged have patience and endurelady Beatrice have you wept all this whileyea and I will weep a while longerI will not desire thatyou have no reason I do it freelysurely I do believe your fair cousin is wrongedah how much might the man deserve of me that would right heris there any way to show such friendshipa very even way but no such friendmay a man do itit is a mans office but not yoursI do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strangeas strange as the thing I know notit were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as your but believe me not and yet I lie not I confess nothing not I deny nothing I am sorry for my cousinby my sword Beatrice thou lovest medo not swear by it and eat itI will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat it that says I love not youwill you not eat your wordwith no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love theewhy then God forgive mewhat offence sweet Beatriceyou have stayed me in a happy hourI was about to protest I loved youand do it with all thy heartI love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protestcome bid me do anything for theekill Claudioha not for the wide worldyou kill me to deny it farewelltarry sweet BeatriceI am gone though I am here there is no love in you nay I pray you let me gobeatricein faith I will gowell be friends firstyou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemyis Claudio thine enemyis he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman O that I were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour O God that I were a man I would eat his heart in the market-placehear me Beatricetalk with a man out at a window a proper sayingnay but Beatricesweet Hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undonebeatprinces and counties Surely a princely testimony a goodly Count Comfect a sweet gallant surely O that I were a man for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into curtsies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it I cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grievingtarry good Beatrice by this hand I love theeuse it for my love some other way than swearing by itthink you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Heroyea as sure as I have a thought or a soulenough I am engaged I will challenge him I will kiss your hand and so leave you by this hand Claudio shall render me a dear account as you hear of me so think of me go comfort your cousin I must say she is dead and so farewellis our whole dissembly appearedO a stool and a cushion for the sextonwhich be the malefactorsmarry that am I and my partnernay thats certain we have the exhibition to examinebut which are the offenders that are to be examined let them come before master constableyea marry let them come before mewhat is your name friendborachiopray write down Borachio yours sirrahI am a gentleman sir and my name is Conradewrite down master gentleman Conrade masters do you serve Godyea sir we hopeyea sir we hopewrite down that they hope they serve God and write God first for God defend but God should go before such villains masters it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves and it will go near to be thought so shortly how answer you for yourselvesmarry sir we say we are nonea marvellous witty fellow I assure you but I will go about with him come you hither sirrah a word in your ear sir I say to you it is thought you are false knavessir I say to you we are nonewell stand aside fore God they are both in a tale have you writ down that they are nonemaster constable you go not the way to examine you must call forth the watch that are their accusersyea marry thats the eftest way let the watch come forth masters I charge you in the princes name accuse these menthis man said sir that Don John the princes brother was a villainwrite down prince John a villainwhy this is flat perjury to call a princes brother villainmaster constablepray thee fellow peace I do not like thy look I promise theewhat heard you him say elsemarry that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfullyflat burglary as ever was committedyea by the mass that it iswhat else fellowand that Count Claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly and not marry herO villain thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for thiswhat elsethis is alland this is more masters than you can deny prince John is this morning secretly stolen away Hero was in this manner accused in this very manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died master constable let these men be bound and brought to Leonatos I will go before and show him their examinationcome let them be opinionedlet them be in the handsoff coxcombgods my life wheres the sexton let him write down the princes officer coxcomb come bind them thou naughty varletaway you are an ass you are an assdost thou not suspect my place dost thou not suspect my years O that he were here to write me down an ass but masters remember that I am an ass though it be not written down yet forget not that I am an ass no thou villain thou art full of piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness I am a wise fellow and which is more an officer and which is more a householder and which is more as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina and one that knows the law go to and a rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath had losses and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him bring him away O that I had been writ down an assif you go on thus you will kill yourselfand itis not wisdom thus to second griefagainst yourselfI pray thee cease thy counselwhich falls into mine ears as profitlessas water in a sieve give not me counselnor let no comforter delight mine earbut such a one whose wrongs do suit with minebring me a father that so loved his childwhose joy of her is overwhelmed like mineand bid him speak of patiencemeasure his woe the length and breadth of mineand let it answer every strain for strainas thus for thus and such a grief for suchin every lineament branch shape and formif such a one will smile and stroke his beardbid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groanpatch grief with proverbs make

tongues that I believe said she for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning theres a double tongue theres two tongues thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh thou wast the properest man in Italyfor the which she wept heartily and said she cared notyea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly the old mans daughter told us allall all and moreover God saw him when he was hid in the gardenbut when shall we set the savage bulls horns on the sensible Benedicks headyea and text underneath here dwells Benedick the married man fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour you break jests as braggarts do

troth theres one meaning well suitedwho have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood whats your offencesweet prince let me go no further to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me I have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Heros garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her my villany they have upon record which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my masters false accusation and briefly I desire nothing but the reward of a villainruns not this speech like iron through your bloodI have drunk poison whiles he uttered itbut did my brother set thee on to thisyea and paid me richly for the practice of ithe is composed and framed of treacheryand fled he is upon this villanysweet Hero now thy image doth appearin the rare semblance that I loved it firstcome bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter and masters do not forget to spefy when time and place shall serve that I am an asshere here comes master

hell enjoin me toI cannot bid you bid my daughter livethat were impossible but I pray you bothpossess the people in Messina herehow innocent she died and if your lovecan labour aught in sad

daughteralmost the copy of my child thats deadand she alone is heir to both of usgive her the right you should have given her cousinand so dies my revengeO noble siryour over-kindness doth wring tears from meI do embrace your offer and disposefor henceforth of poor Claudioto-morrow then I will expect your comingto-night I take my leave this naughty manshall face to face be brought to Margaretwho I believe was packed in all this wronghired to it by your brotherno by my soul she was notnor knew not what she did when she spoke to mebut always hath been just and virtuousin anything that I do know by hermoreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass I beseech you let it be remembered in his punishment and also the watch heard them talk of one Deformed they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in Gods name the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing for Gods sake pray you examine him upon that pointI thank thee for thy care and honest painsyour worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth and I praise God for youtheres for thy painsgod save the foundationgo I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank theeI leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech your worship to corect yourself for the example of others God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished God prohibit it come neighbouruntil to-morrow morning lords farewellfarewell my lords we look for you to-morrowwe will not failto-night iull mourn with Herobring you these fellows on well talk with Margarethow her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellowpray thee sweet mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatricewill you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beautyin so high a style Margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest itto have no man come over me why shall I always keep below stairsthy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth it catchesand yours as blunt as the fencers foils which hit but hurt nota most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman and so I pray thee call Beatrice I give thee the bucklersgive us the swords we have bucklers of our ownif you use them Margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maidswell I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legsand therefore will comethe god of lovethat sits aboveand knows me and knows mehow pitiful I deserveI mean in singing but in loving Leander the good swimmer Troilus the first employer of pandars and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love Marry I cannot show it in rime I have tried I can find out no rime to lady but baby an innocent rime for scorn horn a hard rime for school fool a babbling rime very ominous endings no I was not born under a riming planet nor I cannot woo in festival termssweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called theeyea signior and depart when you bid meO stay but till thenthen is spoken fare you well now and yet ere I go let me go with that I came for which is with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudioonly foul words and thereupon I will kiss theefoul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore I will depart unkissedthou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forble is thy wit but I must tell thee plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe him a coward and I pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with mefor them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for mesuffer love a good epithet I do suffer love indeed for I love thee against my willin spite of your heart I think Alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake I will spite it for yours for I will never love that which my friend hatesthou and I are too wise to woo peaceablyit appears not in this confession theres not one wise man among twenty that will praise himselfan old an old instance Beatrice that lived in the time of good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weepsand how long is that think youquestion why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore it is most expedient for the wise if Don Worm his consence find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as I am to myself so much for praising myself who I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousinvery illand how do youvery ill tooserve God love me and mend there will I leave you too for here comes one in hastemadam you must come to your uncle yonders old coil at home it is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused the prince and Claudio mightily abused and Don John is the author of all who is fled and gone Will you come presentlywill you go hear this news signiorI will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy unclesis this the monument of Leonatoit is my lorddone to death by slanderous tongueswas the Hero that here liesdeath in guerdon of her wrongsgives her fame which never diesso the life that died with shamelives in doath with glorious famehang thou there upon the tombpraising her when I am dumbnow music sound and sing your solemn hymnpardon goddess of the nightthose that slew thy virgin knightfor the which with songs of woeround about her tomb they gomidnight assist our moanhelp us to sigh and groanheavily heavilygraves yawn and yield your deadtill death be utteredheavily heavilynow unto thy bones good nightyearly will I do this ritegood morrow masters put your torches outthe wolves have preyed and look the gentle daybefore the wheels of Phoebus round aboutdapples the drowsy east with spots of greythanks to you all and leave us fare you wellgood morrow masters each his several waycome let us hence and put on other weedsand then to Leonatos we will goand Hymen now with luckier issue speedsthan this for whom we rendered up this woedid I not tell you she was innocentso are the prince and Claudio who accused herupon the error that you heard debatedbut Margaret was in some fault for thisalthough against her will as it appearsin the true course of all the questionwell I am glad that all things sort so welland so am I being else by faith enforcedto call young Claudio to a reckoning for itwell daughter and you gentlewomen allwithdraw into a chamber by yourselvesand when I send for you come hither maskedthe prince and Claudio promised by this hourto visit meyou know your office brotheryou must be father to your brothers daughterand give her to young Claudiowhich I will do with confirmed countenancefriar I must entreat your pains I thinkto do what signiorto bind me or undo me one of themsignior Leonato truth it is good signioryour niece regards me with an eye of favourthat eye my daughter lent her itis most trueand I do with an eye of love requite herthe sight whereof I think you had from mefrom Claudio and the prince but whats your willyour answer sir is enigmaticalbut for my will my will is your good willmay stand with ours this day to be conjoinedin the state of honourable marriagein which good friar I shall desire your helpmy heart is with your likingand my helphere come the prince and Claudiogood morrow to this fair assemblygood morrow prince good morrow Claudiowe here attend you are you yet determinedto-day to marry with my brothers daughteriull hold my mind were she an Ethiopcall her forth brother heres the friar readygood morrow Benedick why whats the matterthat you have such a february faceso full of frost of storm and cloudinessI think he thinks upon the savage bulltush fear not man well tip thy horns with goldand all Europa shall rejoice at theeas once Europa did at lusty Jovewhen he would play the noble beast in lovebull Jove sir had an amiable lowand some such strange bull leaped your fathers cowand got a calf in that same noble featmuch like to you for you have just his bleatfor this I owe you here come other reckoningswhich is the lady I must seize uponthis same is she and I do give you herwhy then shes mine sweet let me see your faceno that you shall not till you take her handbefore this friar and swear to marry hergive me your hand before this holy friarI am your husband if you like of meand when I lived I was your other wifeand when you loved you were my other husbandanother Heronothing certainerone Hero died defiled but I do liveand surely as I live I am a maidthe former Hero Hero that is deadshe died my lord but whiles her slander livedall this amazement can I qualifywhen after that the holy rites are endediull tell you largely of fair Heros deathmeantime let wonder seem familiarand to the chapel let us presentlysoft and fair friar Which is BeatriceI answer to that name what is your willdo not you love mewhy no no more than reasonwhy then your uncle and the prince and Claudiohave been deceived for they swore you diddo not you love metroth no no more than reasonwhy then my cousin Margaret and Ursulaare much deceived for they did swear you didthey swore that you were almost sick for methey swore that you were well-nigh dead for meitis no such matter then you do not love meno truly but in friendly recompensecome cousin I am sure you love the gentlemanand iull be sworn uponit that he loves herfor heres a paper written in his handa halting sonnet of his own pure brainfashioned to Beatriceand heres anotherwrit in my cousins hand stolen from her pocketcontaining her affection unto Benedicka miracle heres our own hands against our hearts come I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pityI would not deny you but by this good day I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told you were in a consumptionpeace I will stop your mouthhow dost thou Benedick the married maniull tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since I do purpose to marry I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part Claudio I did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousinI had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a double-dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to theecome come we are friends lets have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heelswell have danng afterwardfirst of my word therefore play music prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with hornmy lord your brother John is taen in flightand brought with armed men back to Messinathink not on him till to-morrow iull devise thee brave punishments for him Strike up pipersperies Prince of TYreto sing a song that old was sungfrom ashes anent Gower is comeassuming mans infirmitiesto glad your ear and please your eyesit hath been sung at festivalson ember-eves and holy-alesand lords and ladies in their liveshave read it for restorativesthe purchase is to make men gloriouset bonum quo antiquius eo meliusif you born in these latter timeswhen wits more ripe accept my rimesand that to hear an old man singmay to your wishes pleasure bringI life would wish and that I mightwaste it for you like taper-lightthis Antioch then Antiochus the greatbuilt up this ty for his chiefest seatthe fairest in all SyriaI tell you what mine authors saythis king unto him took a ferewho died and left a female heirso buxom blithe and full of faceas heaven had lent her all his gracewith whom the father liking tookand her to incest did provokebad child worse father to entice his ownto evil should be done by noneby custom what they did beginwas with long use account no sinthe beauty of this sinful damemade many princes thither frameto seek her as a bed-fellowin marriage-pleasures play-fellowwhich to prevent he made a lawto keep her still and men in awethat whoso asked her for his wifehis riddle told not lost his lifeso for her many a wight did dieas yon grim looks do testifywhat now ensues to the judgment of your eyeI give my cause who best can justifyyoung prince of Tyre you have at large receivedthe danger of the task you undertakeI have Antiochus and with a soulemboldened with the glory of her praisethink death no hazard in this enterprisebring in our daughter clothed like a bridefor the embracements even of Jove himselfat whose conception till Luna reignednature this dowry gave to glad her presencethe senate-house of planets all did sitto knit in her their best perfectionssee where she comes apparelled like the springgraces her subjects and her thoughts the kingof every virtue gives renown to menher face the book of praises where is readnothing but curious pleasures as from thencesorrow were ever razed and testy wrathcould never be her mild companionyou gods that made me man and sway in lovethat hath inflamed desire in my breastto taste the fruit of you celestial treeor die in the adventure be my helpsas I am son and servant to your willto compass such a boundless happinessprince Periclesthat would be son to great Antiochusbefore thee stands this fair Hesperideswith golden fruit but dangerous to be touchedfor death-like dragons here affright thee hardher face like heaven enticeth thee to viewher countless glory which desert must gainand which without desert because thine eyepresumes to reach all thy whole heap must dieyon sometime famous princes like thyselfdrawn by report adventurous by desiretell thee with speechless tongues and semblance palethat without covering save yon field of starsthey here stand martyrs slain in Cupids warsand with dead cheeks advise thee to desistfor going on deaths net whom none resistantiochus I thank thee who hath taughtmy frail mortality to know itselfand by those fearful objects to preparethis body like to them to what I mustfor death remembered should be like a mirrorwho tells us lifes but breath to trust it erroriull make my will then and as sick men dowho know the world see heaven but feeling woegripe not at earthly joys as erst they didso I bequeath a happy peace to youand all good men as every prince should domy riches to the earth from whence they camebut my unspotted fire of love to youthus ready for the way of life or deathI wait the sharpest blowscorning advice read the conclusion thenwhich read and not expounded itis decreedas these before thee thou thyself shalt bleedof all sayed yet mayst thou prove prosperousof all sayed yet I wish thee happinesslike a bold champion I assume the listsnor ask advice of any other thoughtbut faithfulness and courageI am no viper yet I feedon mothers flesh which did me breedI sought a husband in which labourI found that kindness in a fatherhes father son and husband mildI mother wife and yet his childhow they may be and yet in twoas you will live resolve it yousharp physic is the last but O you powersthat give heaven countless eyes to view mens actswhy cloud they not their sights perpetuallyif this be true which makes me pale to read itfair glass of light I loved you and could stillwere not this glorious casket stored with illbut I must tell you now my thoughts revoltfor hes no man on whom perfections waitthat knowing sin within will touch the gateyoure a fair viol and your sense the stringswho fingered to make men his lawful musicwould draw heaven down and all the gods to hearkenbut being played upon before your timehell only danceth at so harsh a chimegood sooth I care not for youprince Pericles touch not upon thy lifefor thats an article within our lawas dangerous as the rest your times expiredeither expound now or receive your sentencegreat kingfew love to hear the sins they love to acttwould braid yourself too near for me to tell itwho has a book of all that monarchs dohes more secure to keep it shut than shownfor vice repeated is like the wandering windblows dust in others eyes to spread itselfand yet the end of all is bought thus dearthe breath is gone and the sore eyes see clearto stop the air would hurt them the blind mole castscopped hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngedby mans oppression and the poor worm doth die foritkings are earths gods in vice their laws their willand if Jove stray who dares say Jove doth illit is enough you know and it is fitwhat being more known grows worse to smother itall love the womb that their first being bredthen give my tongue like leave to love my headheaven that I had thy head he has found the meaningbut I will gloze with him young prince of Tyrethough by the tenour of our strict edictyour exposition misinterpretingwe might proceed to cancel of your daysyet hope succeeding from so fair a treeas your fair self doth tune us otherwiseforty days longer we do respite youif by which time our secret be undonethis mercy shows well joy in such a sonand until then your entertain shall beas doth befit our honour and your worthhow courtesy would seem to cover sinwhen what is done is like a hypocritethe which is good in nothing but in sightif it be true that I interpret falsethen were it certain you were not so badas with foul incest to abuse your soulwhere now youre both a father and a sonby your untimely claspings with your childwhich pleasure fits a husband not a fatherand she an eater of her mothers fleshby the defiling of her parents bedand both like serpents are who though they feedon sweetest flowers yet they poison breedantioch farewell for wisdom sees those menblush not in actions blacker than the nightwill shun no course to keep them from the lightone sin I know another doth provokemurders as near to lust as flame to smokepoison and treason are the hands of sinay and the targets to put off the shamethen lest my life be cropped to keep you clearby flight iull shun the danger which I fearhe hath found the meaning for which we meanto take his headhe must not live to trumpet forth my infamynor tell the world Antiochus doth sinin such a loathed mannerand therefore instantly this prince must diefor by his fall my honour must keep highwho attends us theredoth your highness callthaliardyoure of our chamber and our mind partakesher private actions to your secrecyand for your faithfulness we will advance youthaliard behold heres poison and heres goldwe hate the prince of Tyre and thou must kill himit fits thee not to ask the reason whybecause we bid it Say is it donemy lord itis doneenoughlet your breath cool yourself telling your hastemy lord prince Pericles is fledas thouwilt live fly after and as an arrow shotfrom a well-experienced archer hits the markhis eye doth level at so thou neer returnunless thou say prince Pericles is dead my lordif I can get him within my pistols lengthiull make him sure enough so farewell to your highnessthaliard adieutill Pericles be deadmy heart can lend no succour to my headlet none disturb uswhy should this change of thoughtsthe sad companion dull-eyed melancholybe my so used a guest as not an hourin the days glorious walk or peaceful nightthe tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiethere pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun themand danger which I feared is at Antiochwhose arm seems far too short to hit me hereyet neither pleasures art can joy my spiritsnor yet the others distance comfort methen it is thus the passions of the mindthat have their first conception by mis-dreadhave after-nourishment and life by careand what was first but fear what might be donegrows elder now and cares it be not doneand so with me the great Antiochusgainst whom I am too little to contendsince hes so great can make his will his actwill think me speaking though I swear to silencenor boots it me to say I honour himif he suspect I may dishonour himand what may make him blush in being knownhell stop the course by which it might be knownwith hostile forces hell oerspread the landand with the ostent of war will look so hugeamazement shall drive courage from the stateour men be vanquished ere they do resistand subjects punished that neer thought offencewhich care of them not pity of myselfwho am no more but as the tops of treeswhich fence the roots they grow by and defend themmake both my body pine and soul to languishand punish that before that he would punishjoy and all comfort in your sacred breastand keep your mind till you return to uspeaceful and comfortablepeace peace and give experience tonguethey do abuse the king that flatter himfor flattery is the bellows blows up sinthe thing the which is flattered but a sparkto which that blast gives heat and stronger glowingwhereas reproof obedient and in orderfits kings as they are men for they may errwhen Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peacehe flatters you makes war upon your lifeprince pardon me or strike me if you pleaseI cannot be much lower than my kneesall leave uselse but let your cares oerlookwhat shipping and what ladings in our havenand then return to ushelicanus thouhast moved us what seest thou in our looksan angry brow dread lordif there be such a dart in princes frownshow durst thy tongue move anger to our facehow dare the plants look up to heaven from whencethey have their nourishmentthou knowest I have powerto take thy life from theeI have ground the axe myselfdo you but strike the blowrise prithee risesit down thou art no flattererI thank thee for it and heaven forbidthat kings should let their ears hear their faults hidfit counsellor and servant for a princewho by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servantwhat wouldst thou have me doto bear with patiencesuch griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourselfthou speakest like a physian Helicanusthat ministerest a potion unto methat thou wouldst tremble to receive thyselfattend me then I went to Antiochwhere as thou knowest against the face of deathI sought the purchase of a glorious beautyfrom whence an issue I might propagateare arms to princes and bring joys to subjectsher face was to mine eye beyond all wonderthe rest hark in thine ear as black as incestwhich by my knowledge found the sinful fatherseemed not to strike but smooth but thou knowest thisitis time to fear when tyrants seem to kisswhich fear so grew in me I hither fledunder the covering of a careful nightwho seemed my good protector and being herebethought me what was past what might succeedI knew him tyrannous and tyrants fearsdecrease not but grow faster than the yearsand should he doubt it as no doubt he doththat I should open to the listening airhow many worthy princes bloods were shedto keep his bed of blackness unlaid opeto lop that doubt hell fill this land with armsand make pretence of wrong that I have done himwhen all for mine if I may call'toffencemust feel wars blow who spares not innocencewhich love to all of which thyself art onewho now reprovest me for italas sirdrew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeksmusings into my mind with thousand doubtshow I might stop this tempest ere it cameand finding little comfort to relieve themI thought it princely charity to grieve themwell my lord since you have given me leave to speakfreely will I speak Antiochus you fearand justly too I think you fear the tyrantwho either by public war or private treasonwill take away your lifetherefore my lord go travel for a whiletill that his rage and anger be forgotor till the Destinies do cut his thread of lifeyour rule direct to any if to meday serves not light more faithful than iull beI do not doubt thy faithbut should he wrong my liberties in my absencewell mingle our bloods together in the earthfrom whence we had our being and our birthtyre I now look from thee then and to Tarsusintend my travel where iull hear from theeand by whose letters iull dispose myselfthe care I had and have of subjects goodon thee iull lay whose wisdoms strength can bear itiull take thy word for faith not ask thine oathwho shuns not to break one will sure crack bothbut in our orbs well live so round and safethat time of both this truth shall neer convincethou showedsta subjects shine I a true princeso this is Tyre and this the court here must I kill king Pericles and if I do not I am sure to be hanged at home itis dangerous well I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do I see he had some reason for it for if a king bid a man be a villain he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one Hush here come the lords of Tyreyou shall not need my fellow peers of Tyrefurther to question me of your kings departurehis sealed commission left in trust with medoth speak suffiently hes gone to travelhow the king goneif further yet you will be satisfiedwhy as it were unlicensed of your loveshe would depart iull give some light unto youbeing at Antiochwhat from Antiochroyal Antiochus on what cause I know nottook some displeasure at him at least he judged soand doubting lest that he had erred or sinnedto show his sorrow heed correct himselfso puts himself unto the shipmans toilwith whom each minute threatens life or deathwell I perceiveI shall not be hanged now although I wouldbut since hes gone the king it sure must pleasehe scaped the land to perish at the seaiull present myselfpeace to the lords of Tyrelord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcomefrom him I comewith message unto princely Periclesbut since my landing I have understoodyour lord hath betook himself to unknown travelsmy message must return from whence it camewe have no reason to desire itcommended to our master not to usyet ere you shall depart this we desireas friends to Antioch we may feast in Tyremy Dionyza shall we rest us hereand by relating tales of others griefssee if itwill teach us to forget our ownthat were to blow at fire in hope to quench itfor who digs hills because they do aspirethrows down one mountain to cast up a higherO my distressed lord even such our griefs arehere theyre but felt and seen with mischiefs eyesbut like to groves being topped they higher riseO Dionyzawho wanteth food and will not say he wants itor can conceal his hunger till he famishour tongues and sorrows do sound deepour woes into the air our eyes do weeptill tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louderthat if heaven slumber while their creatures wantthey may awake their helps to comfort themiull then discourse our woes felt several yearsand wanting breath to speak help me with tearsiull do my best sirthis Tarsus oer which I have the governmenta ty on whom plenty held full handfor riches strewed herself even in the streetswhose towers bore heads so high they kissed the cloudsand strangers neer beheld but wondered atwhose men and dames so jetted and adornedlike one anothers glass to trim them bytheir tables were stored full to glad the sightand not so much to feed on as delightall poverty was scorned and pride so greatthe name of help grew odious to repeatO itis too truebut see what heaven can do by this our changethese mouths whom but of late earth sea and airwere all too little to content and pleasealthough they gave their creatures in abundanceas houses are defiled for want of usethey are now starved for want of exersethose palates who not yet two summers youngermust have inventions to delight the tastewould now be glad of bread and beg for itthose mothers who to nousle up their babesthought nought too curious are ready nowto eat those little darlings whom they lovedso sharp are hungers teeth that man and wifedraw lots who first shall die to lengthen lifehere stands a lord and there a lady weepinghere many sink yet those which see them fallhave scarce strength left to give them burialis not this trueour cheeks and hollow eyes do witness itO let those ties that of plentys cupand her prosperities so largely tastewith their superfluous riots hear these tearsthe misery of Tarsus may be theirswheres the lord governorherespeak out thy sorrows which thou bringest in hastefor comfort is too far for us to expectwe have descried upon our neighbouring shorea portly sail of ships make hitherwardI thought as muchone sorrow never comes but brings an heirthat may succeed as his inberitorand so in ours Some neighbouring nationtaking advantage of our miseryhath stuffed these hollow vessels with their powerto beat us down the which are down alreadyand make a conquest of unhappy mewhereas no glorys got to overcomethats the least fear for by the semblanceof their white flags displayed they bring us peaceand come to us as favourers not as foesthou speakest like him s untutored to repeatwho makes the fairest show means most deceitbut bring they what they will and what they canwhat need we fearthe grounds the lowest and we are half way therego tell their general we attend him hereto know for what he comes and whence he comesand what he cravesI go my lordwelcome is peace if he on peace consistif wars we are unable to resistlord governor for so we hear you arelet not our ships and number of our menbe like a beacon fired to amaze your eyeswe have heard your miseries as far as Tyreand seen the desolation of your streetsnor come we to add sorrow to your tearsbut to relieve them of their heavy loadand these our ships you happily may thinkare like the Trojan horse was stuffed withinwith bloody veins expecting overthroware stored with corn to make your needy breadand give them life whom hunger starved half deadthe gods of Greece protect youand well pray for youarise I pray you risewe do not look for reverence but for loveand harbourage for ourself our ships and menthe which when any shall not gratifyor pay you with unthankfulness in thoughtbe it our wives our children or ourselvesthe curse of heaven and men succeed their evilstill when the which I hope shall neer be seenyour grace is welcome to our town and uswhich welcome well accept feast here awhileuntil our stars that frown lend us a smilehere have you seen a mighty kinghis child I wis to incest bringa better prince and benign lordthat will prove awful both in deed and wordbe quiet then as men should betill he hath passed necessityiull show you those in troubles reignlosing a mite a mountain gainthe good in conversationto whom I give my benisonis still at Tarsus where each manthinks all is writ he speken canand to remember what he doesbuild his statue to make him gloriousbut tidings to the contraryare brought your eyes what need speak Igood Helicane hath stayed at homenot to eat honey like a dronefrom others labours for though he striveto killen bad keep good aliveand to fulfil his prince desiresends word of all that haps in Tyrehow Thaliard came full bent with sinand had intent to murder himand that in Tarsus was not bestlonger for him to make his resthe doing so put forth to seaswhere when men been theres seldom easefor now the wind begins to blowthunder above and deeps belowmake such unquiet that the shipshould house him safe is wracked and splitand he good prince having all lostby waves from coast to coast is tostall perishen of man of pelfne aught escapen but himselftill fortune tired with doing badthrew him ashore to give him gladand here he comes what shall be nextpardon old Gower this longs the textyet cease your ire you angry stars of heavenwind rain and thunder remember earthly manis but a substance that must yield to youand I as fits my nature do obey youalas the sea hath cast me on the rockswashed me from shore to shore and left me breathnothing to think on but ensuing deathlet it suffice the greatness of your powersto have bereft a prince of all his fortunesand having thrown him from your watery gravehere to have death in peace is all hell cravewhat ho Pilchha come and bring away the netswhat Patch-breech I saywhat say you masterlook how thou stirrest now come away or iull fetch thee with a wannionfaith master I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before useven nowalas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them when well-a-day we could scarce help ourselvesnay master said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled they say theyre half fish half flesh a plague on them they neer come but I look to be washed master I marvel how the fishes live in the seawhy as men do a-land the great ones eat up the little ones I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at last devours them all at a mouthful such whales have I heard on ofthe land who never leave gaping till theyve swallowed the whole parish church steeple bells and alla pretty moralbut master if I had been the sexton I would have been that day in the belfrywhy manbecause he should have swallowed me too and when I had been in his belly I would have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should never have left till he cast bells steeple church and parish up again but if the good king Simonides were of my mindsimonideswe would purge the land of these drones that rob the bee of her honeyhow from the finny subject of the seathese fishers tell the infirmities of menand from their watery empire recollectall that may men approve or men detectpeace be at your labour honest fishermenhonest good fellow whats that if it be a day fits you search out of the calendar and nobody look after itY may see the sea hath cast me on your coastwhat a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our waya man whom both the waters and the windin that vast tennis-court have made the ballfor them to play upon entreats you pity himhe asks of you that never used to begno friend cannot you beg heres them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with workingcanst thou catch any fishes thenI never practised itnay then thou wilt starve sure for heres nothing to be got now-a-days unless thou canst fish foritwhat I have been I have forgot to knowbut what I am want teaches me to think ona man thronged up with cold my veins are chilland have no more of life than may sufficeto give my tongue that heat to ask your helpwhich if you shall refuse when I am deadfor that I am a man pray see me burieddie quoth-a now gods forbid I have a gown here come put it on keep thee warm now afore me a handsome fellow come thou shalt go home and well have flesh for holidays fish for fasting-days and moreoer puddings and flap-jacks and thou shalt be welcomeI thank you sirhark you my friend you said you could not begI did but cravebut crave then iull turn craver too and so I shall scape whippingwhy are all your beggars whipped thenO not all my friend not all for if all your beggars were whipped I would wish no better office than to be beadle but master iull go draw up the nethow well this honest mirth becomes their labourhark you sir do you know where ye arenot wellwhy iull tell you this is called Pentapolis and our king the good Simonidesthe good king Simonides do you call himay sir and he deserves to be so called for his peaceable reign and good governmenthe is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shoremarry sir half a days journey and iull tell you he hath a fair daughter and to-morrow is her birthday and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her lovewere my fortunes equal to my desires I could wish to make one thereO sir things must be as they may and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal for his wifes soulhelp master help heres a fish hangs in the net like a poor mans right in the law itwill hardly come out Ha bots onit itis come at last and itis turned to a rusty armouran armour friends I pray you let me see itthanks fortune yet that after all my crossesthou givest me somewhat to repair myselfand though it was mine own part of mine heritagewhich my dead father did bequeath to mewith this strict charge even as he left his lifekeep it my Pericles it hath been a shieldbtwixt me and death and pointed to this bracefor that it saved me keep it in like necessitythe which the gods protect thee from'tmay defend thee it kept where I kept I so dearly loved ittill the rough seas that spare not any mantook it in rage though calmed they have given'tagainI thank thee forit my shipwrack now s no illsince I have here my fathers gift in s willwhat mean you sirto beg of you kind friends this coat of worthfor it was sometime target to a kingI know it by this mark he loved me dearlyand for his sake I wish the having of itand that youed guide me to your sovereigns courtwhere with it I may appear a gentlemanand if that ever my low fortunes betteriull pay your bounties till then rest your debtorwhy wilt thou tourney for the ladyiull show the virtue I have borne in armswhy doe take it and the gods give thee good onitay but hark you my friend itwas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the water there are certain condolements certain vails I hope sir if you thrive youll remember from whence you had itbelieve it I willby your furtherance I am clothed in steeland spite of all the rapture of the seathis jewel holds his biding on my armunto thy value will I mount myselfupon a courser whose delightful stepsshall make the gazer joy to see him treadonly my friend I yet am unprovidedof a pair of baseswell sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair and iull bring thee to the court myselfthen honour be but a goal to my will this day iull rise or else add ill to illare the knights ready to begin the triumphthey are my liegeand stay your coming to present themselvesreturn them we are ready and our daughterin honour of whose birth these triumphs aresits here like beautys child whom nature gatfor men to see and seeing wonder atit pleaseth you my royal father to expressmy commendations great whose merits lessitis fit it should be so for princes area model which heaven makes like to itselfas jewels lose their glory if neglectedso princes their renowns if not respecteditis now your honour daughter to explainthe labour of each knight in his devicewhich to preserve mine honour iull performwho is the first that doth prefer himselfa knight of Sparta my renowned fatherand the device he bears upon his shieldis a black Ethiop reaching at the sunthe word Lux tua vita mihIhe loves you well that holds his life of youwho is the second that presents himselfa prince of Macedon my royal fatherand the device he bears upon his shieldis an armed knight thats conquered by a ladythe motto thus in Spanish Piu por dulzura que por fuerzaand whats the thirdthe third of Antiochand his device a wreath of chivalrythe word Me pompprovexit apexwhat is the fourtha burning torch thats turned upside downthe word quod me alit me extinguitwhich shows that beauty hath his power and willwhich can as well inflame as it can killthe fifth a hand environed with cloudsholding out gold thats by the touchstone triedthe motto thus Sic spectanda fidesand what sthe sixth and last the which the knight himselfwith such a graceful courtesy deliveredhe seems to be a stranger but his present isa withered branch thats only green at topthe motto in hac spe vivoa pretty moralfrom the dejected state wherein he ishe hopes by you his fortune yet may flourishhe had need mean better than his outward showcan any way speak in his just commendfor by his rusty outside he appearsto have practised more the whipstock than the lancehe well may be a stranger for he comesto an honoured triumph strangely furnishedand on set purpose let his armour rustuntil this day to scour it in the dustopinions but a fool that makes us scanthe outward habit by the inward manbut stay the knights are coming well withdrawinto the galleryknightsto say youre welcome were superfluousto place upon the volume of your deedsas in a title-page your worth in armswere more than you expect or more thans fitsince every worth in show commends itselfprepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feastyou are princes and my guestsbut you my knight and guestto whom this wreath of victory I giveand crown you king of this days happinessitis more by fortune lady than by meritcall it by what you will the day is yoursand here I hope is none that envies itin framing an artist art hath thus decreedto make some good but others to exceedand youre her laboured scholar come queen ofthe feastfor daughter so you are here take your placemarshal the rest as they deserve their gracewe are honoured much by good Simonidesyour presence glads our days honour we lovefor who hates honour hates the gods abovesir yonder is your placesome other is more fitcontend not sir for we are gentlementhat neither in our hearts nor outward eyesenvy the great nor do the low despiseyou are right courteous knightssit sir sitby Jove I wonder that is king of thoughtsthese cates resist me she but thought uponby Juno that is queen of marriageall viands that I eat do seem unsavourywishing him my meat Sure hes a gallant gentlemanhes but a country gentlemanhe has done no more than other knights have donehe has broken a staff or so so let it passto me he seems like diamond to glassyon kings to me like to my fathers picturewhich tells me in that glory once he washad princes sit like stars about his throneand he the sun for them to reverencenone that beheld him but like lesser lightsdid vail their crowns to his supremacywhere now his sons like a glow-worm in the nightthe which hath fire in darkness none in lightwhereby I see that Times the king of menhes both their parent and he is their graveand gives them what he will not what they cravewhat are you merry knightswho can be other in this royal presencehere with a cup thats stored unto the brimas you do love fill to your mistress lipswe drink this health to youwe thank your graceyet pause awhileyon knight doth sit too melancholyas if the entertainment in our courthad not a show might countervail his worthnote it not you Thaisawhat is itto me my fatherO attend my daughterprinces in this should live like gods abovewho freely give to every one that comesto honour themand princes not doing so are like to gnatswhich make a sound but killed are wondered attherefore to make his entrance more sweethere say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to himalas my father it befits not meunto a stranger knight to be so boldhe may my proffer take for an offencesince men take womens gifts for impudencehowdo as I bid you or youll move me elsenow by the gods he could not please me betterand further tell him we desire to know of himof whence he is his name and parentagethe king my father sir has drunk to youI thank himwishing it so much blood unto your lifeI thank both him and you and pledge him freelyand further he desires to know of youof whence you are your name and parentagea gentleman of Tyre my name Periclesmy education been in arts and armswho looking for adventures in the worldwas by the rough seas reft of ships and menand after shipwrack driven upon this shorehe thanks your grace names himself Periclesa gentleman of Tyrewho only by misfortune of the seasbereft of ships and men cast on this shorenow by the gods I pity his misfortuneand will awake him from his melancholycome gentlemen we sit too long on triflesand waste the time which looks for other revelseven in your armours as you are addressedwill very well become a soldiers danceI will not have excuse with saying thisloud music is too harsh for ladies headssince they love men in arms as well as bedsso this was well asked itwas so well performedcome sirhere is a lady that wants breathing tooand I have often heard you knights of Tyreare excellent in making ladies tripand that their measures are as excellentin those that practise them they are my lordO thats as much as you would be deniedof your fair courtesyunclasp unclaspthanks gentlemen to all all have done wellbut you the best Pages and lights to conductthese knights unto their several lodgings yours sirwe have given order to be next our ownI am at your graces pleasureprinces it is too late to talk of loveand thats the mark I know you level attherefore each one betake him to his restto-morrow all for speeding do their bestno Escanes know this of meantiochus from incest lived not freefor which the most high gods not minding longerto withhold the vengeance that they had in storedue to this heinous capital offenceeven in the height and pride of all his glorywhen he was seated in a chariotof an inestimable value and his daughter with hima fire from heaven came and shrivelled uptheir bodies even to loathing for they so stunkthat all those eyes adored them ere their fallscorn now their hand should give them burialitwas very strangeand yet but just for thoughthis king were great his greatness was no guardto bar heavens shaft but sin had his rewarditis very truesee not a man in private conferenceor counselhas respect with him but heit shall no longer grieve without reproofand cursed be he that will not second itfollow me then lord Helicane a wordwith me and welcome Happy day my lordsknow that our griefs are risen to the topand now at length they overflow their banksyour griefs for what wrong not the prince you lovewrong not yourself then noble Helicanebut if the prince do live let us salute himor know what grounds made happy by his breathif in the world he live well seek him outif in his grave he rest well find him thereand be resolved he lives to govern usor dead give s cause to mourn his funeraland leaves us to our free electionwhose deaths indeed the strongest in our censureand knowing this kingdom is without a headlike goodly buildings left without a roofsoon fall to ruin your noble selfthat best knowest how to rule and how to reignwe thus submit unto our sovereignlive noble Helicanefor honours cause forbear your suffragesif that you love prince Pericles forbeartake I your wish I leap into the seaswheres hourly trouble for a minutes easea twelvemonth longer let me entreat youto forbear the absence of your kingif in which time expired he not returnI shall with aged patience bear your yokebut if I cannot win you to this lovego search like nobles like noble subjectsand in your search spend your adventurous worthwhom if you find and win unto returnyou shall like diamonds sit about his crownto wisdom hes a fool that will not yieldand since lord Helicane enjoineth uswe with our travels will endeavour itthen you love us we you and well clasp handswhen peers thus knit a kingdom ever standsgood morrow to the good Simonidesknights from my daughter this I let you knowthat for this twelvemonth shell not undertakea married lifeher reason to herself is only knownwhich yet from

by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowedand on her virgin honour will not break itthough loath to bid farewell we take our leavessotheyre well dispatched now to my daughters lettershe tells me here

gain her love or your displeasuretraitor thou liesttraitoray traitoreven in his throat unless it be the kingthat calls me traitor I return the lienow by the gods I do applaud his couragemy actions are as noble as my thoughtsthat never relished of a base descentI came unto your court for honours causeand not to be a rebel to her stateand he that otherwise accounts of methis sword shall prove hes honours enemynohere comes my daughter she can witness itthen as you are as virtuous as fairresolve your angry father if my tonguedid eer solit or my hand subscribeto any syllable

the wrackof earned praise Marinas lifeseeks to take off by treasons knifeand in this kind hath our Cleonone daughter and a wench full growneven ripe for marriage-rite this maidhight Philoten and it is saidfor certain in our story shewould ever with Marina bebe'twhen she weaved the sleided silkwith fingers long small white as milkor when she would with sharp neeld woundthe cambric which she made more soundby hurting it when to the luteshe sung and made the night-bird mutethat still records with moan or whenshe would with rich and constant penvail to her mistress Dian stillthis Philoten contends in skillwith absolute Marina sowith the dove of Paphos might the crowvie feathers white Marina getsall praises which are paid as debtsand not as given this so darksin Philoten all graceful marksthat Cleons wife with envy rarea present murderer does preparefor good Marina that her daughtermight stand peerless by this slaughterthe sooner her vile thoughts to

proportion to live quietly and so give overwhy to give over I pray you is it a shame to get when we are oldO our credit comes not in like the commodity nor the commodity wages not with the danger therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate itwere not amiss to keep our door hatched besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving overcome

through the marketI have cried her almost to the number of her hairs I have drawn her picture with my voiceand I prithee tell me how dost thou find the inclination of the people espeally of the younger sortfaith they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their fathers testament there was a Spaniards mouth so watered that he went to bed to her very descriptionwe shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff onto-night to-night but mistress do you know the French knight that cowers inthe hamswho Monsieur Verolesay he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation but he made a groan at it and swore he would see her to-morrowwell well as for him he brought his disease hither here he does but repair it I know he will come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the sunwell if we had of every nation a traveller we should lodge them with this signpray you come hither awhile you have fortunes coming upon you mark me you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly to despise profit where you have most gain to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion and that opinion a mere profitI understand you notO take her home mistress take her home these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practicethou sayst true infaith so they must for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrantfaith some do and some do not but mistress if I have bargained for the jointthou mayst cut a morsel off the spitI may sowho should deny it come young one I like the manner of your garments wellay by my faith they shall not be changed yetboult spend thou that in the town report what a sojourner we have youll lose nothing by custom when nature framed this piece she meant thee a good turn therefore say what a paragon she is and thou hast the harvest out of thine own reportI warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdly-inclined iull bring home some to-nightcome your ways follow meif fires be hot knives sharp or waters deepuntied I still my virgin knot will keepdiana aid my purposewhat

chief lord of all this spaous worldied give it to undo the deed O ladymuch less in blood than virtue yet a princessto equal any single crown ofthe earthinthe justice of compare O villain Leoninewhom thou hast poisoned tooif thou hadst drunk to him'thad been a kindnessbecoming well thy fact what canst thou saywhen noble Pericles shall demand his childthat she is dead nurses are not the fatesto foster it nor ever to preserveshe died at night iull say so who can cross itunless you play the pious innocentand for an honest attribute cry outshe died by foul play O go to well wellof all the faults beneath the heavens the godsdo like this worstbe one of those that thinkthe pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly henceand open this to Pericles I do shameto think of what a noble strain you areand of how coward a spiritto such proceedingwho ever but his approbation addedthough not his prime consent he did not flowfrom honourable sourcesbe it so thenyet none does know but you how she came deadnor none can know Leonine being goneshe did distain my child and stood betweenher and her fortunes none would look on herbut cast their gazes on Marinas facewhilst ours was blurted at and held a malkinnot worth the time of day it pierced me thoroughand though you call my course unnaturalyou not your child well loving yet I findit greets me as an enterprise of kindnessperformed to your sole daughterheavens forgive itand as for Pericleswhat should he say we wept after her hearseand even yet we mourn her monumentis almost finished and her epitaphsin glittering golden characters expressa general praise to her and care in usat whose expense itis donethou art like the harpywhich to betray dost with thine angels faceseize with thine eagles talonsyou are like one that superstitiouslydoth swear to the gods that winter kills the fliesbut yet I know youll do as I advisethus time we waste and longest leagues make shortsail seas in cockles have an wish but foritmaking to take your imaginationfrom bourn to bourn region to regionby you being pardoned we commit no crimeto use one language in each several climewhere our scenes seem to live I do beseech youto learn of me who stand inthe gaps to teach youthe stages of our story Periclesis now again thwarting the wayward seasattended on by many a lord and knightto see his daughter all his lifes delightold Helicanus goes along Behindis left to govern it you bear in mindold Escanes whom Helicanus lateadvanced in time to great and high estatewell-sailing ships and bounteous winds have broughtthis king to Tarsus think his pilot thoughtso with his steerage shall your thoughts grow onto fetch his daughter home who first is gonelike motes and shadows see them move awhileyour ears unto your eyes iull reconlesee how belief may suffer by foul showthis borrowed passion stands for true old woeand Pericles in sorrow all devouredwith sighs shot through and biggest tears oershoweredleaves Tarsus and again embarks he swearsnever to wash his face nor cut his hairshe puts on sackcloth and to sea he bearsa tempest which his mortal vessel tearsand yet he rides it out now please you witthe epitaph is for Marina writby wicked Dionyzathe fairest sweetest and best lies herewho withered in her spring of yearshe was of tyrus the kings daughteron whom foul death hath made this slaughtermarina was she called and at her birththetis being proud swallowed some part ofthe earththerefore the earth fearing to be oerflowedhath thetis birth-child on the heavens bestowedwherefore she does and swears shell never stintmake raging battery upon shores of flintno visor does become black villanyso well as soft and tender flatterylet Pericles believe his daughters deadand bear his courses to be orderedby Lady fortune while our scene must playhis daughters woe and heavy well-a-dayin her unholy service Patience thenand think you now are all in

weary for the stalenessO sir a courtesywhich if we should deny the most just godsfor every graff would send a caterpillarand so afflict our province yet once morelet me entreat to know at large the causeof your kings sorrowsit sir I will recount it to youbut see I am preventedO here isthe lady that I sent for welcome fair oneisit not a goodly presenceshes a gallant ladyshes such a one that were I well assuredcame of a gentle kind and noble stockied wish no better choice and think me rarely wedfair one all goodness that consists in bountyexpect even here where is a kingly patientif that thy prosperous and artifial featcan draw him but to answer thee in aughtthy sacred physic shall receive such payas thy desires can wishsir I will usemy utmost skill in his

to himhail sir my lord lend earhum haI am a maidmy lord that neer before invited eyesbut have been gazed on like a comet she speaksmy lord that may be hath endured a griefmight equal yours if both were justly weighedthough wayward fortune did malign my statemy derivation was from ancestorswho stood equivalent with mighty kingsbut time hath rooted out my parentageand to the world and awkward casualtiesbound me in servitudeI will desistbut there is something glows upon my cheekand whispers in mine ear go not till he speak my fortunes parentage good parentageto equal mine was it not thus what say youI said my lord if you did know my parentageyou would not do me violenceI do think so pray you turn your eyes upon meyou are like something that what country-womanhere of these shoresno nor of any shoresyet I was mortally brought forth and amno other than I appearI am great with woe and shall deliver weepingmy dearest wife was like this maid and such a onemy daughter might have been my queens square browsher stature to an inch as wand-like straightas silver-voiced her eyes as jewel-likeand cased as richly in pace another Junowho starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungrythe more she gives them speech where do you livewhere I am but a stranger from the deckyou may discern the placewhere were you bredand how achieved you these endowments whichyou make more rich to oweshould I tell my history it would seemlike lies disdained in the reportingprithee speakfalseness cannot come from thee for thou lookestmodest as justice and thou seemest a palacefor the crowned truth to dwell in I believe theeand make my senses credit thy relationto points that seem impossible for thou lookestlike one I loved indeed what were thy friendsdidst thou not say when I did push thee backwhich was when I perceived thee that thou camestfrom good descendingso indeed I didreport thy parentage I think thou saidstthou hadst been tossed from wrong to injuryand that thou thoughtest thy griefs might equal mineif both were openedsome such thingI said and said no more but what my thoughtsdid warrant me was likelytell thy storyif thine considered prove the thousandth partof my endurance thou art a man and Ihave suffered like a girl yet thou dost looklike Patience gazing on kings graves and smilingextremity out of

Pericles his queen and daughter seenalthough assailed with fortune fierce and keenvirtue preserved from fell destructions blastled on by heaven and crowned with joy at lastin Helicanus may you well descrya figure of truth of faith of loyaltyin reverend Cerimon there well appearsthe worth that learned charity aye wearsfor wicked Cleon and his wife when famehad spread their cursed deed and honoured nameof Pericles to rage the ty turnthat him and his they in his palace burnthe gods for murder seemed so contentto punish them although not done but meantso on your patience evermore attendingnew joy wait on you here our play hath endingproceed Solinus to procure my falland by the doom of death end woes and allmerchant of Syracusa plead no moreI am not partial to infringe our lawsthe enmity and discord which of latesprung from the rancorous outrage of your duketo merchants our well-dealing countrymenwho wanting guilders to redeem their liveshave sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloodsexcludes all pity from our threatning looksfor since the mortal and intestine jarsbtwixt thy seditious countrymen and usit hath in solemn synods been decreedboth by the Syracusians and ourselvest admit no traffic to our adverse townsnay more if any born at Ephesusbe seen at Syracusian marts and fairsagain if any Syracusian borncome to the bay of Ephesus he dieshis goods confiscate to the dukes disposeunless a thousand marks be leviedto quit the penalty and to ransom himthy substance valued at the highest ratecannot amount unto a hundred markstherefore by law thou art condemned to dieyet this my comfort when your words are donemy woes end likewise with the evening sunwell Syracusian say in brief the causewhy thou departedst from thy native homeand for what cause thou camest to Ephesusa heavier task could not have been imposedthan I to speak my griefs unspeakableyet that the world may witness that my endwas wrought by nature not by vile offenceiull utter what my sorrow gives me leavein Syracusa was I born and wedunto a woman happy but for meand by me too had not our hap been badwith her I lived in joy our wealth increasedby prosperous voyages I often madeto Epidamnum till my factors deathand the great care of goods at random leftdrew me from kind embracements of my spousefrom whom my absence was not six months oldbefore herself almost at fainting underthe pleasing punishment that women bearhad made provision for her following meand soon and safe arrived where I wasthere had she not been long but she becamea joyful mother of two goodly sonsand which was strange the one so like the otheras could not be distinguished but by namesthat very hour and in the self-same inna meaner woman was deliveredof such a burden male twins both alikethose for their parents were exceeding poorI bought and brought up to attend my sonsmy wife not meanly proud of two such boysmade daily motions for our home returnunwilling I agreed alas too soonwe came aboarda league from Epidamnum had we sailedbefore the always-wind-obeying deepgave any tragic instance of our harmbut longer did we not retain much hopefor what obscured light the heavens did grantdid but convey unto our fearful mindsa doubtful warrant of immediate deathwhich though myself would gladly have embracedyet the incessant weepings of my wifeweeping before for what she saw must comeand piteous plainings of the pretty babesthat mourned for fashion ignorant what to fearforced me to seek delays for them and meand this it was for other means was nonethe sailors sought for safety by our boatand left the ship then sinking-ripe to usmy wife more careful for the latter-bornhad fastened him unto a small spare mastsuch as seafaring men provide for stormsto him one of the other twins was boundwhilst I had been like heedful of the otherthe children thus disposed my wife and Ifixing our eyes on whom our care was fixedfastened ourselves at either end the mastand floating straight obedient to the streamwere carried towards Corinth as we thoughtat length the sun gazing upon the earthdispersed those vapours that offended usand by the benefit of his wished lightthe seas waxed calm and we discoveredtwo ships from far making amain to usof Corinth that of Epidaurus thisbut ere they came O let me say no moregather the sequel by that went beforenay forward old man do not break off sofor we may pity though not pardon theeO had the gods done so I had not nowworthily termed them merless to usfor ere the ships could meet by twice five leagueswe were encountered by a mighty rockwhich being violently borne uponour helpful ship was splitted in the midstso that in this unjust divorce of usfortune had left to both of us alikewhat to delight in what to sorrow forher part poor soul seeming as burdenedwith lesser weight but not with lesser woewas carried with more speed before the windand in our sight they three were taken upby fishermen of Corinth as we thoughtat length another ship had seized on usand knowing whom it was their hap to savegave healthful welcome to their ship-wracked guestsand would have reft the fishers of their preyhad not their bark been very slow of sailand therefore homeward did they bend their coursethus have you heard me severed from my blissthat by misfortune was my life prolongedto tell sad stories of my own mishapsand for the sake of them thou sorrowest fordo me the favour to dilate at fullwhat hath befalln of them and thee till nowmy youngest boy and yet my eldest careat eighteen years became inquisitiveafter his brother and importuned methat his attendant for his case was likereft of his brother but retained his namemight bear him company in the quest of himwhom whilst I laboured of a love to seeI hazarded the loss of whom I lovedfive summers have I spent in furthest Greeceroaming clean through the bounds of Asiaand coasting homeward came to Ephesushopeless to find yet loath to leave unsoughtor that or any place that harbours menbut here must end the story of my lifeand happy were I in my timely deathcould all my travels warrant me they livehaplessgeon whom the fates have markedto bear the extremity of dire mishapnow trust me were it not against our lawsagainst my crown my oath my dignitywhich princes would they may not disannulmy soul should sue as advocate for theebut though thou art adjudged to the deathand passed sentence may not be recalledbut to our honours great disparagementyet will I favour thee in what I cantherefore merchant iull limit thee this dayto seek thy life by benefial helptry all the friends thou hast in Ephesusbeg thou or borrow to make up the sumand live if no then thou art doomed to diegaoler take him to thy custodyI will my lordhopeless and helpless dothgeon wendbut to procrastinate his lifeless endtherefore give out you are of Epidamnumlest that your goods too soon be confiscatethis very day a Syracusian merchantis apprehended for arrival hereand not being able to buy out his lifeaccording to the statute of the towndies ere the weary sun set in the westthere is your money that I had to keepgo bear it to the Centaur where we hostand stay there Dromio till I come to theewithin this hour it will be dinner-timetill that iull view the manners of the townperuse the traders gaze upon the buildingsand then return and sleep within mine innfor with long travel I am stiff and wearyget thee awaymany a man would take you at your wordand go indeed having so good a meana trusty villain sir that very oftwhen I am dull with care and melancholylightens my humour with his merry jestswhat will you walk with me about the townand then go to my inn and dine with meI am invited sir to certain merchantsof whom I hope to make much benefitI crave your pardon Soon at five oclockplease you iull meet with you upon the martand afterward consort you till bed-timemy present business calls me from you nowfarewell till then I will go lose myselfand wander up and down to view the tysir I commend you to your own contenthe that commends me to mine own contentcommends me to the thing I cannot getI to the world am like a drop of waterthat in the ocean seeks another dropwho falling there to find his fellow forthunseen inquisitive confounds himselfso I to find a mother and a brotherin quest of them unhappy lose myselfhere comes the almanack of my true datewhat now how chance thou art returned so soonreturned so soon rather approached too latethe capon burns the pig falls from the spitthe clock hath strucken twelve upon the bellmy mistress made it one upon my cheekshe is so hot because the meat is coldthe meat is cold because you come not homeyou come not home because you have no stomachyou have no stomach having broke your fastbut we that know what itis to fast and prayare penitent for your default to-daystop in your wind sir tell me this I praywhere have you left the money that I gave youO sixpence that I had o Wednesday lastto pay the saddler for my mistress crupperthe saddler had it sir I kept it notI am not in a sportive humour nowtell me and dally not where is the moneywe being strangers here how darest thou trustso great a charge from thine own custodyI pray you jest sir as you sit at dinnerI from my mistress come to you in postif I return I shall be post indeedfor she will score your fault upon my patemethinks your maw like mine should be your clockand strike you home without a messengercome Dromio come these jests are out of seasonreserve them till a merrier hour than thiswhere is the gold I gave in charge to theeto me sir why you gave no gold to mecome on sir knave have done your foolishnessand tell me how thou hast disposed thy chargemy charge was but to fetch you from the marthome to your house the Phoenix sir to dinnermy mistress and her sister stays for younow as I am a christian answer mein what safe place you have bestowed my moneyor I shall break that merry sconce of yoursthat stands on tricks when I am undisposedwhere is the thousand marks thou hadst of meI have some marks of yours upon my patesome of my mistress marks upon my shouldersbut not a thousand marks between you bothif I should pay your worship those againperchance you will not bear them patientlythy mistress marks what mistress slave hast thouyour worships wife my mistress at the Phoenixshe that doth fast till you come home to dinnerand prays that you will chide you home to dinnerwhat wilt thou flout me thus unto my facebeing forbid there take you that sir knavewhat mean you sir for Gods sake hold your handsnay an you will not sir iull take my heelsupon my life by some device or otherthe villain is oer-raught of all my moneythey say this town is full of cozenageas nimble jugglers that deceive the eyedark-working sorcerers that change the mindsoul-killing witches that deform the bodydisguised cheaters prating mountebanksand many such-like liberties of sinif it prove so I will be gone the sooneriull to the Centaur to go seek this slaveI greatly fear my money is not safeneither my husband nor the slave returnedthat in such haste I sent to seek his mastersure Luana it is two oclockperhaps some merchant hath invited himand from the mart hes somewhere gone to dinnergood sister let us dine and never freta man is master of his libertytime is their master and when they see timetheyll go or come if so be patient sisterwhy should their liberty than ours be morebecause their business still lies out o doorlook when I serve him so he takes it illO know he is the bridle of your willtheres none but asses will be bridled sowhy headstrong liberty is lashed with woetheres nothing situate under heavens eyebut hath his bound in earth in sea in skythe beasts the fishes and the winged fowlsare their males subjects and at their controlsmen more divine the masters of all theselords of the wide world and wild watry seasindued with intellectual sense and soulsof more pre-eminence than fish and fowlsare masters to their females and their lordsthen let your will attend on their accordsthis servitude makes you to keep unwednot this but troubles of the marriage-bedbut were you wedded you would bear some swayere I learn love iull practise to obeyhow if your husband start some other wheretill he come home again I would forbearpatience unmoved no marvel though she pausethey can be meek that have no other causea wretched soul bruised with adversitywe bid be quiet when we hear it crybut were we burdened with like weight of painas much or more we should ourselves complainso thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve theewith urging helpless patience wouldst relieve mebut if thou live to see like right bereftthis fool-begged patience in thee will be leftwell I will marry one day but to tryhere comes your man now is your husband nighsay is your tardy master now at handnay hes at two hands with me and that my two ears can witnesssay didst thou speak with him knowest thou his minday ay he told his mind upon mine earbeshrew his hand I scarce could understand itspake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaningnay he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand thembut say I prithee is he coming homeit seems he hath great care to please his wifewhy mistress sure my master is horn-madhorn-mad thou villainI mean not cuckold-mad but sure he is stark madwhen I desired him to come home to dinnerhe asked me for a thousand marks in golditis dinner time quoth I my gold quoth heyour meat doth burn quoth I my gold quoth hewill you come home quoth I my gold quoth hewhere is the thousand marks I gave thee villain the pig quoth I is burned my gold quoth hemy mistress sir quoth I hang up thy mistressI know not thy mistress out on thy mistress quoth whoquoth my masterI know quoth he no house no wife no mistress so that my errand due unto my tongueI thank him I bear home upon my shouldersfor in conclusion he did beat me therego back again thou slave and fetch him homego back again and be new beaten homefor Gods sake send some other messengerback slave or I will break thy pate acrossand he will bless that cross with other beatingbetween you I shall have a holy headhence prating peasant fetch thy master homeam I so round with you as you with methat like a football you do spurn me thusyou spurn me hence and he will spurn me hitherif I last in this service you must case me in leatherfie how impatience loureth in your facehis company must do his minions gracewhilst I at home starve for a merry lookhath homely age the alluring beauty tookfrom my poor cheek then he hath wasted itare my discourses dull barren my witif voluble and sharp discourse be marredunkindness blunts it more than marble harddo their gay vestments his affections baitthats not my fault hes master of my statewhat ruins are in me that can be foundby him not ruined then is he the groundof my defeatures my decayed faira sunny look of his would soon repairbut too unruly deer he breaks the paleand feeds from home poor I am but his staleself-harming jealousy fie beat it henceunfeeling fools can with such wrengs dispenseI know his eye doth homage otherwhereor else what lets it but he would be heresister you know he promised me a chainwould that alone alone he would detainso he would keep fair quarter with his bedI see the jewel best enamelledwill lose his beauty and though gold bides stillthat others touch yet often touching willwear gold and no man that hath a nameby falsehood and corruption doth it shamesince that my beauty cannot please his eyeiull weep whats left away and weeping diehow many fond fools serve mad jealousythe gold I gave to Dromio is laid upsafe at the Centaur and the heedful slaveis wandered forth in care to seek me outby computation and mine hosts reportI could not speak with Dromio since at firstI sent him from the mart See here he comeshow now sir is your merry humour alteredas you love strokes so jest with me againyou know no Centaur you received no goldyour mistress sent to have me home to dinnermy house was at the Phoenix wast thou madthat thus so madly thou didst answer mewhat answer sir when spake I such a wordeven now even here not half-an-hour sinceI did not see you since you sent me hencehome to the Centaur with the gold you gave mevillain thou didst deny the golds receiptand toldest me of a mistress and a dinnerfor which I hope thou feltest I was displeasedI am glad to see you in this merry veinwhat means this jest I pray you master tell meyea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeththinkest thou I jest hold take thou that and thathold sir for Gods sake now your jest is earnestupon what bargain do you give it mebecause that I familiarly sometimesdo use you for my fool and chat with youyour sauness will jest upon my loveand make a common of my serious hourswhen the sun shines let foolish gnats make sportbut creep in crannies when he hides his beamsif you will jest with me know my aspectand fashion your demeanour to my looksor I will beat this method in your sconcesconce call you it so you would leave battering I had rather have it a head an you use these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and insconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders but I pray sir why am I beatendost thou not knownothing sir but that I am beatenshall I tell you whyay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a whereforewhy first for flouting me and then whereforefor urging it the second time to mewas there ever any man thus beaten out of seasonwhen in the why and the wherefore is neither rime nor reasonwell sir I thank youthank me sir for whatmarry sir for this something that you gave me for nothingiull make you amends next to give you nothing for something but say sir is it dinner-timeno sir I think the meat wants that I havein good time sir whats thatbastingwell sir then itwill be dryif it be sir I pray you eat none of ityour reasonlest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry bastingwell sir learn to jest in good time theres a time for all thingsI durst have denied that before you were so cholericby what rule sirmarry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father Time himselflets hear ittheres no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by naturemay he not do it by fine and recoveryyes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another manwhy is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrementbecause it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in witwhy but theres many a man hath more hair than witnot a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hairwhy thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without witthe plainer dealer the sooner lost yet be loseth it in a kind of jollityfor what reasonfor two and sound ones toonay not sound I pray yousure ones thennay not sure in a thing falsingcertain ones thenname themthe one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridgeyou would all this time have proved there is no time for all thingsmarry and did sir namely no time to recover hair lost by naturebut your reason was not substantial why there is not time to recoverthus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore to the worlds end will have bald followersI knew twould be a bald conclusionbut soft who wafts us yonderay ay Antipholus look strange and frownsome other mistress hath thy sweet aspectsI am not Adriana nor thy wifethe time was once when thou unurged wouldst vowthat never words were music to thine earthat never object pleasing in thine eyethat never touch well welcome to thy handthat never meat sweet-savoured in thy tasteunless I spake or looked or touched or carved to theehow comes it now my husband O how comes itthat thou art thus estranged from thyselfthyself I call it being strange to methat undividable incorporateam better than thy dear selfs better partah do not tear away thyself from mefor know my love as easy mayst thou falla drop of water in the breaking gulfand take unmingled thence that drop againwithout addition or diminishingas take from me thyself and not me toohow dearly would it touch thee to the

would have me as a beast not that I being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to mewhat is shea very reverent body aye such a one as a man may not speak of without he say Sir-reverence I have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriagehow dost thou mean a fat marriagemarry sir shes the kitchen-wench and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter if she lives till doomsday shell burn a week

will mendno sir itis in grain noahs flood could not do itwhats her namenell sir but her name and three quarters that is an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hipthen she bears some breadthno longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe I could find out countries in herin what part of her body stands Irelandmarry sir in her buttocks I found it out by the bogswhere ScotlandI found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the handwhere Francein her forehead armed and reverted making war against her heirwhere EnglandI looked for the chalky cliffs but I could find no whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and itwhere Spainfaith I saw not but I felt it hot in her breathwhere America the IndiesO sir upon her nose all oer embellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nosewhere stood Belgia the NetherlandsO sir I did not look so low to conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me called me Dromio swore I was assured to her told me what privy marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I amazed ran from her as a witchand I think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steelshe had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn inthe wheelgo chide thee presently post to the roadan if the wind blow any way from shoreI will not harbour in this town to-nightif any bark put forth come to the martwhere I will walk till thou return to meif every one knows us and we know noneitis time I think to trudge pack and be goneas from a bear a man would run for lifeso fly I from her that would be my wifetheres none but witches do inhabit hereand therefore itis high time that I were henceshe that doth call me husband even my souldoth for a wife abhor but

forsake your libertyI understand thee notno why itis a plain case he that went like a base-viol in a case of leather the man sir that when gentlemen are tired gives them a fob and rests them he sir that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pikewhat thou meanest an officeray sir the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says God give you good rest well sir there rest in your foolery is there any ship puts

pray you sir my ring or else the chainI hope you do not mean to cheat me soavaunt thou witch come Dromio let us gofly pride says the peacock mistress that you knownow out of doubt Antipholus is madelse would he never so demean himselfa ring he hath of mine worth forty ducatsand for the same he promised me a chainboth one and other he denies me nowthe reason that I gather he is madbesides this present instance of his rageis a mad tale he told to-day at dinnerof his own doors being shut against his entrancebelike his wife acquainted with his fitson purpose shut the doors against his waymy way is now to chide home to his houseand tell his wife that being lunatiche rushed into my house and took perforcemy ring away this course I fittest choosefor forty ducats is too much to losefear me not man I will not break awayiull give thee ere I leave thee so much moneyto warrant thee as I am rested formy wife is in a wayward mood to-dayand will not lightly trust

rather persuade him to hold his handsthou whoreson senseless villainI would I were senseless sir that I might not feel your blowsthou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an assI am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long ears I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows when I am cold he heats me with beating when I am warm he cools me with beating I am waked with it when I sleep raised with it when I sit driven out of doors with it when I go from home welcomed home with it when I return nay I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it from door to doorcome go along my wife is coming yondermistress respice finem respect your end or rather

shamedined at home thou villain what sayest thousir sooth to say you did not dine at homewere not my doors locked up and I shut outperdy your doors were locked and you shut outand did not she herself revile me theresans fable she herself reviled you theredid not her kitchen-maid rail taunt and scorn mecertes she did the kitchen-vestal scorned youand did not I in rage depart from thencein verity you did my bones bear witnessthat since have felt the vigour of his rageisit good to soothe him in these contrariesit is no shame the fellow finds his veinand yielding to him humours well his frenzythou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest mealas I sent you money to redeem youby Dromio here who came in haste for itmoney by me heart and good will you mightbut surely master not a rag of moneywentest not thou to her for a purse of ducatshe came to me and I delivered itand I am witness with her that she didgod and the rope-maker bear me witnessthat I was sent for nothing but a ropemistress both man and master is possessedI know it by their pale and deadly looksthey must be bound and laid in some dark roomsay wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-dayand why dost thou deny the bag of goldI did not gentle husband lock thee forthand gentle master I received no goldbut I confess sir that we were locked outdissembling villain thou speakest false in bothdissembling harlot thou art false in alland art confederate with a damned packto make a loathsome abject scorn of mebut with these nails iull pluck out those false eyesthat would behold in me this shameful sportO bind him bind him let him not come near memore company the fiend is strong within himay me poor man how pale and wan he lookswhat will you murder me thou gaoler thouI am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer themto make a rescuemasters let him gohe is my prisoner and you shall not have himgo bind this man for he is frantic toowhat wilt thou do thou peevish officerhast thou delight to see a wretched mando outrage and displeasure to himselfhe is my prisoner if I let him gothe debt he owes will be required of meI will discharge thee ere I go from theebear me forthwith unto his creditorand knowing how the debt grows I will pay itgood master doctor see him safe conveyedhome to my house O most unhappy dayO most unhappy strumpetmaster I am

Sister go you with mesay now whose suit is he arrested atone Angelo a goldsmith do you know himI know the man what is the sum he owestwo hundred ducatssay how grows it duedue for a chain your husband had of himhe did bespeak a chain for me but had it notwhen as your husband all in rage to-daycame to my house and took away my ringthe ring I saw upon his finger nowstraight after did I meet him with a chainit may be so but I did never see itcome gaoler bring me where the goldsmith isI long to know the truth hereof at largegod for thy mercy they are loose againand come with naked swords lets call more helpto have them bound againaway theyll kill usI see these witches are afraid of swordsshe that would be your wife now ran from youcome to the Centaur fetch our stuff from thenceI long that we were safe and sound aboardfaith stay here this night they will surely do us no harm you saw they speak us fair give us gold methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witchI will not stay to-night for all the towntherefore away to get our stuff aboardI am sorry sir that I have hindered youbut I protest he had the chain of methough most dishonestly he doth deny ithow is the man esteemed here in the tyof very reverend reputation sirof credit infinite highly belovedsecond to none that lives here in the tyhis word might bear my wealth at any timespeak softly yonder as I think he walksitis so and that self chain about his neckwhich he forswore most monstrously to havegood sir draw near to me iull speak to himsignior Antipholus I wonder muchthat you would put me to this shame and troubleand not without some scandal to yourselfwith rcumstance and oaths so to denythis chain which now you wear so openlybeside the charge the shame imprisonmentyou have done wrong to this my honest friendwho but for staying on our controversyhad hoisted sail and put to sea to-daythis chain you had of me can you deny itI think I had I never did deny ityes that you did sir and forswore it toowho heard me to deny it or forswear itthese ears of mine thou knowest did hear theefie on thee wretch itis pity that thou livestto walk where any honest men resortthou art a villain to impeach me thusiull prove mine honour and mine honestyagainst thee presently if thou darest standI dare and do defy thee for a villainhold hurt him not for Gods sake he is madsome get within him take his sword awaybind Dromio too and bear them to my houserun master run for Gods sake take a housethis is some priory in or we are spoiledbe quiet people wherefore throng you hitherto fetch my poor distracted husband hencelet us come in that we may bind him fastand bear him home for his recoveryI knew he was not in his perfect witsI am sorry now that I did draw on himhow long hath this possession held the manthis week he hath been heavy sour sadand much different from the man he wasbut till this afternoon his passionneer brake into extremity of ragehath he not lost much wealth by wrack of seaburied some dear friend hath not else his eyestrayed his affection in unlawful lovea sin prevailing much in youthful menwho give their eyes the liberty of gazingwhich of these sorrows is he subject toto none of these except it be the lastnamely some love that drew him oft from homeyou should for that have reprehended himwhy so I diday but not rough enoughas roughly as my modesty would let mehaply in privateand in assemblies tooay but not enoughit was the copy of our conferencein bed he slept not for my urging itat board he fed not for my urging italone it was the subject of my themein company I often glanced itstill did I tell him it was vile and badand thereof came it that the man was madthe venom clamours of a jealous womanpoison more deadly than a mad dogs toothit seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railingand thereof comes it that his head is lightthou sayest his meat was sauced with thy upbraidingsunquiet meals make ill digestionsthereof the raging fire of fever bredand whats a fever but a fit of madnessthou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawlssweet recreation barred what doth ensuebut moody moping and dull melancholykinsman to grim and comfortless despairand at her heels a huge infectious troopof pale distemperatures and foes to lifein food in sport and life-preserving restto be disturbed would mad or man or beastthe consequence is then thy jealous fitshave scared thy husband from the use of witsshe never reprehended him but mildlywhen he demeaned himself rough rude and wildlywhy bear you these rebukes and answer notshe did betray me to my own reproofgood people enter and lay hold on himno not a creature enters in my housethen let your servants bring my husband forthneither he took this place for sanctuaryand it shall privilege him from your handstill I have brought him to his wits againor lose my labour in assaying itI will attend my husband be his nursediet his sickness for it is my officeand will have no attorney but myselfand therefore let me have him home with mebe patient for I will not let him stirtill I have used the approved means I havewith wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayersto make of him a formal man againit is a branch and parcel of mine oatha charitable duty of my ordertherefore depart and leave him here with meI will not hence and leave my husband hereand ill it doth beseem your holinessto separate the husband and the wifebe quiet and depart thou shalt not have himcomplain unto the duke of this indignitycome go I will fall prostrate at his feetand never rise until my tears and prayershave won his grace to come in person hitherand take perforce my husband from the abbessby this I think the dial points at fiveanon im sure the duke himself in personcomes this way to the melancholy valethe place of death and sorry executionbehind the ditches of the abbey hereupon what causeto see a reverend Syracusian merchantwho put unluckily into this bayagainst the laws and statutes of this townbeheaded publicly for his offencesee where they come we will behold his deathkneel to the duke before he pass the abbeyyet once again proclaim it publiclyif any friend will pay the sum for himhe shall not die so much we tender himjustice most sacred duke against the abbessshe is a virtuous and a reverend ladyit cannot be that she hath done thee wrongmay it please your grace Antipholus my husbandwhom I made lord of me and all I hadat your important letters this ill daya most outrageous fit of madness took himthat desperately he hurried through the streetwith him his bondman all as mad as hedoing displeasure to the tizensby rushing in their houses bearing thencerings jewels anything his rage did likeonce did I get him bound and sent him homewhilst to take order for the wrongs I wentthat here and there his fury had committedanon I wot not by what strong escapehe broke from those that had the guard of himand with his mad attendant and himselfeach one with ireful passion with drawn swordsmet us again and madly bent on uschased us away till raising of more aidwe came again to bind them then they fledinto this abbey whither we pursued themand here the abbess shuts the gates on usand will not suffer us to fetch him outnor send him forth that we may bear him hencetherefore most gracious duke with thy commandlet him be brought forth and borne hence for helplong since thy husband served me in my warsand I to thee engaged a princes wordwhen thou didst make him master of thy bedto do him all the grace and good I couldgo some of you knock at the abbey gateand bid the lady abbess come to meI will determine this before I stirO mistress mistress shift and save yourselfmy master and his man are both broke loosebeaten the maids a-row and bound the doctorwhose beard they have singed off with brands of fireand ever as it blazed they threw on himgreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hairmy master preaches patience to him and the whilehis man with sssors nicks him like a fooland sure unless you send some present helpbetween them they will kill the conjurerpeace fool thy master and his man are hereand that is false thou dost report to usmistress upon my life I tell you trueI have not breathed almost since I did see ithe cries for you and vows if he can take youto scotch your face and to disfigure youhark hark I hear him mistress fly be gonecome stand by me fear nothing guard with halberdsay me it is my husband Witness youthat he is borne about invisibleeven now we housed him in the abbey hereand now hes here past thought of human reasonjustice most gracious duke O grant me justiceeven for the service that long since I did theewhen I bestrid thee in the wars and tookdeep scars to save thy life even for the bloodthat then I lost for thee now grant me justiceunless the fear of death doth make me doteI see my son Antipholus and Dromiojustice sweet prince against that woman thereshe whom thou gavest to me to be my wifethat hath abused and dishonoured meeven in the strength and height of injurybeyond imagination is the wrongthat she this day hath shameless thrown on mediscover how and thou shalt find me justthis day great duke she shut the doors upon mewhile she with harlots feasted in my housea grievous fault Say woman didst thou sono my good lord myself he and my sisterto-day did dine together so befall my soulas this is false he burdens me withalneer may I look on day nor sleep on nightbut she tells to your highness simple truthO perjured woman they are both forswornin this the madman justly chargeth themmy liege I am advised what I sayneither disturbed with the effect of winenor heady-rash provoked with raging irealbeit my wrongs might make one wiser madthis woman locked me out this day from dinnerthat goldsmith there were he not packed with hercould witness it for he was with me thenwho parted with me to go fetch a chainpromising to bring it to the Porpentinewhere Balthazar and I did dine togetherour dinner done and he not coming thitherI went to seek him in the street I met himand in his company that gentlemanthere did this perjured goldsmith swear me downthat I this day of him received the chainwhich God he knows I saw not for the whichhe did arrest me with an officerI did obey and sent my peasant homefor certain ducats he with none returnedthen fairly I bespoke the officerto go in person with me to my houseby the way we metmy wife her sister and a rabble moreof vile confederates along with themthey brought one Pinch a hungry lean-faced villaina mere anatomy a mountebanka threadbare juggler and a fortune-tellera needy hollow-eyed sharp-looking wretcha living-dead man this pernious slaveforsooth took on him as a conjurerand gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulseand with no face as itwere out-fang mecries out I was possessed then altogetherthey fell upon me bound me bore me thenceand in a dark and dankish vault at homethere left me and my man both bound togethertill gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunderI gained my freedom and immediatelyran hither to your grace whom I beseechto give me ample satisfactionfor these deep shames and great indignitiesmy lord in truth thus far I witness with himthat he dined not at home but was locked outbut had he such a chain of thee or nohe had my lord and when he ran in herethese people saw the chain about his neckbesides I will be sworn these ears of mineheard you confess you had the chain of himafter you first forswore it on the martand thereupon I drew my sword on youand then you fled into this abbey herefrom whence I think you are come by miracleI never came within these abbey wallsnor ever didst thou draw thy sword on meI never saw the chain so help me heavenand this is false you burden me withalwhy what an intricate impeach is thisI think you all have drunk of rces cupif here you housed him here he would have beenif he were mad he would not plead so coldlyyou say he dined at home the goldsmith heredenies that saying Sirrah what say yousir he dined with her there at the Porpentinehe did and from my finger snatched that ringitis true my liege this ring I had of hersawest thou him enter at the abbey hereas sure my liege as I do see your gracewhy this is strange go call the abbess hitherI think you are all mated or stark madmost mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a wordhaply I see a friend will save my lifeand pay the sum that may deliver mespeak freely Syracusian what thou wiltis not your name sir called Antipholusand is not that your bondman Dromiowithin this hour I was his bondman sirbut he I thank him gnawed in two my cordsnow am I Dromio and his man unboundI am sure you both of you remember meourselves we do remember sir by youfor lately we were bound as you are nowyou are not Pinchs patient are you sirwhy look you strange on me you know me wellI never saw you in my life till nowO grief hath changed me since you saw me lastand careful hours with Times deformed handhave written strange defeatures in my facebut tell me yet dost thou not know my voiceneitherdromio nor thouno trust me sir not II am sure thou dostay sir but I am sure I do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe himnot know my voice O times extremityhast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tonguein seven short years that here my only sonknows not my feeble key of untuned caresthough now this grained face of mine be hidin sap-consuming winters drizzled snowand all the conduits of my blood froze upyet hath my night of life some memorymy wasting lamps some fading glimmer leftmy dull deaf ears a little use to hearall these old witnesses I cannot errtell me thou art my son AntipholusI never saw my father in my lifebut seven years since in Syracusa boythou knowest we parted but perhaps my sonthou shamest to acknowledge me in miserythe duke and all that know me in the tycan witness with me that it is not soI neer saw Syracusa in my lifeI tell thee Syracusian twenty yearshave I been patron to Antipholusduring which time he neer saw SyracusaI see thy age and dangers make thee dotemost mighty duke behold a man much wrongedI see two husbands or mine eyes deceive meone of these men is genius to the otherand so of these which is the natural manand which the spirit who dephers themI sir am Dromio command him awayI sir am Dromio pray let me staygeon art thou not or else his ghostO my old master who hath bound him herewhoever bound him I will loose his bondsand gain a husband by his libertyspeak oldgeon if thou beest the manthat hadst a wife once calledmiliathat bore thee at a burden two fair sonsO if thou beest the samegeon speakand speak unto the samemiliaif I dream not thou artmiliaif thou art she tell me where is that sonthat floated with thee on the fatal raftby men of Epidamnum he and Iand the twin Dromio all were taken upbut by and by rude fishermen of Corinthby force took Dromio and my son from themand me they left with those of Epidamnumwhat then became of them I cannot tellI to this fortune that you see me inwhy here begins his morning story rightthese two Antipholus these two so likeand these two Dromios one in semblancebesides her urging of her wrack at seathese are the parents to these childrenwhich acdentally are met togetherantipholus thou camest from Corinth firstno sir not I I came from Syracusestay stand apart I know not which is whichI came from Corinth my most gracious lordand I with himbrought to this town by that most famous warriorduke Menaphon your most renowned unclewhich of you two did dine with me to-dayI gentle mistressand are not you my husbandno I say nay to thatand so do I yet did she call me soand this fair gentlewoman her sister heredid call me brotherwhat I told you thenI hope I shall have leisure to make goodif this be not a dream I see and hearthat is the chain sir which you had of meI think it be sir I deny it notand you sir for this chain arrested meI think I did sir I deny it notI sent you money sir to be your bailby Dromio but I think he brought it notno none by methis purse of ducats I received from youand Dromio my man did bring them meI see we still did meet each others manand I was taen for him and he for meand thereupon these errors are arosethese ducats pawn I for my father hereit shall not need thy father hath his lifesir I must have that diamond from youthere take it and much thanks for my good cheerrenowned duke vouchsafe to take the painsto go with us into the abbey hereand hear at large discoursed all our fortunesand all that are assembled in this placethat by this sympathized one days errorhave suffered wrong go keep us companyand we shall make full satisfactionthirty-three years have I but gone in travailof you my sons and till this present hourmy heavy burdens neer deliveredthe duke my husband and my children bothand you the calendars of their nativitygo to a gossips feast and joy with meafter so long grief such festivitywith all my heart iull gossip at this feastmaster shall I fetch your stuff from shipboarddromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarkedyour goods that lay at host sir in the Centaurhe speaks to me I am your master Dromiocome go with us well look to that anonembrace thy brother there rejoice with himthere is a fat friend at your masters housethat kitchened me for you to-day at dinnershe now shall be my sister not my wifemethinks you are my glass and not my brotherI see by you I am a sweet-faced youthwill you walk in to see their gossipingnot I sir you are my elderthats a question how shall we try itwell draw cuts for the senior till then lead thou firstnay then thuswe came into the world like brother and brotherand now lets go hand in hand not one before anotherin sooth I know not why I am so sadit wearies me you say it wearies youbut how I caught it found it or came by itwhat stuff itis made of whereof it is bornI am to learnand such a want-wit sadness makes of methat I have much ado to know myselfyour mind is tossing on the oceanthere where your argosies with portly saillike signiors and rich burghers on the floodor as it were the pageants of the seado overpeer the petty traffickersthat curtsy to them do them reverenceas they fly by them with their woven wingsbelieve me sir had I such venture forththe better part of my affections wouldbe with my hopes abroad I should be stillplucking the grass to know where sits the windpeering in maps for ports and piers and roadsand every object that might make me fearmisfortune to my ventures out of doubtwould make me sadmy wind cooling my brothwould blow me to an ague when I thoughtwhat harm a wind too great might do at seaI should not see the sandy hour-glass runbut I should think of shallows and of flatsand see my wealthy Andrew docked in sandvailing her high-top lower than her ribsto kiss her burial Should I go to churchand see the holy edifice of stoneand not bethink me straight of dangerous rockswhich touching but my gentle vessels sidewould scatter all her spices on the streamenrobe the roaring waters with my silksand in a word but even now worth thisand now worth nothing Shall I have the thoughtto think on this and shall I lack the thoughtthat such a thing bechanced would make me sadbut tell not me I know Antoniois sad to think upon his merchandisebelieve me no I thank my fortune for itmy ventures are not in one bottom trustednor to one place nor is my whole estateupon the fortune of this present yeartherefore my merchandise makes me not sadwhy then you are in lovefie fienot in love neither then lets say you are sadbecause you are not merry and itwere as easyfor you to laugh and leap and say you are merrybecause you are not sad now by two-headed Janusnature hath framed strange fellows in her timesome that will evermore peep through their eyesand laugh like parrots at a bag-piperand other of such vinegar aspectthat theyll not show their teeth in way of smilethough Nestor swear the jest be laughablehere comes Bassanio your most noble kinsmangratiano and Lorenzo fare ye wellwe leave you now with better companyI would have stayed till I had made you merryif worthier friends had not prevented meyour worth is very dear in my regardI take it your own business calls on youand you embrace the occasion to departgood morrow my good lordsgood signiors both when shall we laugh say whenyou grow exceeding strange must it be sowell make our leisures to attend on yoursmy lord Bassanio since you have found Antoniowe too will leave you but at dinner-timeI pray you have in mind where we must meetI will not fail youyou look not well Signior Antonioyou have too much respect upon the worldthey lose it that do buy it with much carebelieve me you are marvellously changedI hold the world but as the world Gratianoa stage where every man must play a partand mine a sad onelet me play the foolwith mirth and laughter let old wrinkles comeand let my liver rather heat with winethan my heart cool with mortifying groanswhy should a man whose blood is warm withinsit like his grandsire cut in alabastersleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundiceby being peevish I tell thee what AntonioI love thee and it is my love that speaksthere are a sort of men whose visagesdo cream and mantle like a standing pondand do a wilful stillness entertainwith purpose to be dressed in an opinionof wisdom gravity profound conceitas who should say I am sir Oracleand when I ope my lips let no dog bark O my Antonio I do know of thesethat therefore only are reputed wisefor saying nothing when I am very sureif they should speak would almost damn those earswhich hearing them would call their brothers foolsiull tell thee more of this another timebut fish not with this melancholy baitfor this fool-gudgeon this opinioncome good Lorenzo fare ye well awhileiull end my exhortation after dinnerwell we will leave you then till dinner-timeI must be one of these same dumb-wise menfor Gratiano never lets me speakwell keep me company but two years moethou shalt not know the sound of thine own tonguefarewell iull grow a talker for this gearthanks infaith for silence is only commendablein a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendibleis that anything nowgratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the searchwell tell me now what lady is the sameto whom you swore a secret pilgrimagethat you to-day promised to tell me ofitis not unknown to you Antoniohow much I have disabled mine estateby something showing a more swelling portthan my faint means would grant continuancenor do I now make moan to be abridgedfrom such a noble rate but my chief careis to come fairly off from the great debtswherein my time something too prodigalhath left me gaged to you AntonioI owe the most in money and in loveand from your love I have a warrantyto unburthen all my plots and purposeshow to get clear of all the debts I oweI pray you good Bassanio let me know itand if it stand as you yourself still dowithin the eye of honour be assuredmy purse my person my extremest meanslie all unlocked to your occasionsin my school-days when I had lost one shaftI shot his fellow of the self-same flightthe self-same way with more advised watchto find the other forth and by adventuring bothI oft found both I urge this childhood proofbecause what follows is pure innocenceI owe you much and like a wilful youththat which I owe is lost but if you pleaseto shoot another arrow that self waywhich you did shoot the first I do not doubtas I will watch the aim or to find bothor bring your latter hazard back againand thankfully rest debtor for the firstyou know me well and herein spend but timeto wind about my love with rcumstanceand out of doubt you do me now more wrongin making question of my uttermostthan if you had made waste of all I havethen do but say to me what I should dothat in your knowledge may by me be doneand I am prest unto it therefore speakin Belmont is a lady richly leftand she is fair and fairer than that wordof wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messagesher name is Portia nothing undervaluedto Catos daughter Brutus Portianor is the wide world ignorant of her worthfor the four winds blow in from every coastrenowned suitors and her sunny lockshang on her temples like a golden fleecewhich makes her seat of Belmont Colchos strondand many Jasons come in quest of herO my Antonio had I but the meansto hold a rival place with one of themI have a mind presages me such thriftthat I should questionless be fortunatethou knowest that all my fortunes are at seaneither have I money nor commodityto raise a present sum therefore go forthtry what my credit can in Venice dothat shall be racked even to the uttermostto furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portiago presently inquire and so will Iwhere money is and I no question maketo have it of my trust or for my sakeby my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great worldyou would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longergood sentences and well pronouncedthey would be better if well followedif to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse noneyour father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already comeI pray thee over-name them and as thou namest them I will describe them and according to my description level at my affectionfirst there is the Neapolitan princeay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smiththen is there the County Palatinehe doth nothing but frown as who should say An you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married to a deaths-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these God defend me from these twohow say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bongod made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a-capering he will fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I shall never requite himwhat say you then to falconbridge the young baron of Englandyou know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumb-show how oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour every wherewhat think you of the Scottish lord his neighbourthat he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for anotherhow like you the young German the duke of Saxonys nephewvery vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast An the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without himif he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept himtherefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a spongeyou need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the casketsif I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my fathers will I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant them a fair departuredo you not remember lady in your fathers time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in the company of the Marquis of Montferratyes yes it was Bassanio as I think he was so calledtrue madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair ladyI remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praisehow now what newsthe four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of Morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here to-nightif I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me come Nerissa Sirrah go beforewhiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the doorthree thousand ducats wellay sir for three monthsfor three months wellfor the which as I told you Antonio shall be boundantonio shall become bound wellmay you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answerthree thousand ducats for three months and Antonio boundyour answer to thatantonio is a good manhave you heard any imputation to the contraryho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is suffient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships are but boards sailors but men there be land-rats and water-rats land-thieves and water-thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding suffient Three thousand ducats I think I may take his bondbe assured you mayI will be assured I may and that I may be assured I will bethink me May I speak with Antonioif it please you to dine with usyes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you what news on the Rialto who is he comes herethis is Signior Antoniohow like a fawning publican he looksI hate him for he is a christianbut more for that in low simplityhe lends out money gratis and brings downthe rate of usance here with us in Veniceif I can catch him once upon the hipI will feed fat the anent grudge I bear himhe hates our sacred nation and he railseven there where merchants most do congregateon me my bargains and my well-won thriftwhich he calls interest Cursed be my tribeif I forgive himshylock do you hearI am debating of my present storeand by the near guess of my memoryI cannot instantly raise up the grossof full three thousand ducats what of thattubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribewill furnish me but soft how many monthsdo you desirerest you fair good signioryour worship was the last man in our mouthsshylock albeit I neither lend nor borrowby taking nor by giving of excessyet to supply the ripe wants of my friendiull break a customis he yet possessedhow much ye woulday ay three thousand ducatsand for three monthsI had forgot three months you told me sowell then your bond and let me see but hear youmethought you said you neither lend nor borrowupon advantageI do never use itwhen Jacob grazed his uncle Labans sheepthis Jacob from our holy Abram wasas his wise mother wrought in his behalfthe third possessor ay he was the thirdand what of him did he take interestno not take interest not as you would saydirectly interest mark what Jacob didwhen Laban and himself were compromisedthat all the eanlings that were streaked and piedshould fall as Jacobs hire the ewes being rankin end of autumn turned to the ramsand when the work of generation wasbetween these woolly breeders in the actthe skilful shepherd peeled me certain wandsand in the doing of the deed of kindhe stuck them up before the fulsome eweswho then conceiving did in eaning timefall parti-coloured lambs and those were Jacobsthis was a way to thrive and he was blestand thrift is blessing if men steal it notthis was a venture sir that Jacob served fora thing not in his power to bring to passbut swayed and fashioned by the hand of heavenwas this inserted to make interest goodor is your gold and silver ewes and ramsI cannot tell I make it breed as fast but note me signiormark you this Bassaniothe devil can te Scripture for his purposean evil soul produng holy witnessis like a villain with a smiling cheeka goodly apple rotten at the heartO what a goodly outside falsehood haththree thousand ducats itis a good round sumthree months from twelve then let me see the ratewell Shylock shall we be beholding to yousignior Antonio many a time and oftin the Rialto you have rated meabout my moneys and my usancesstill have I borne it with a patient shrugfor sufferance is the badge of all our tribeyou call me misbeliever cut-throat dogand spet upon my Jewish gaberdineand all for use of that which is mine ownwell then it now appears you need my helpgo to then you come to me and you sayshylock we would have moneys you say soyou that did void your rheum upon my beardand foot me as you spurn a stranger curover your threshold moneys is your suitwhat should I say to you Should I not sayhath a dog money is it possiblea cur can lend three thousand ducats orshall I bend low and in a bondmans keywith bated breath and whispering humblenesssay thisfair sir you spet on me on Wednesday lastyou spurned me such a day another timeyou called me dog and for these courtesiesiull lend you thus much moneys I am as like to call thee so againto spet on thee again to spurn thee tooif thou wilt lend this money lend it notas to thy friends for when did friendship takea breed for barren metal of his friendbut lend it rather to thine enemywho if he break thou mayst with better faceexact the penaltywhy look you how you stormI would be friends with you and have your loveforget the shames that you have stained me withsupply your present wants and take no doitof usance for my moneys and youll not hear methis is kind I offerthis were kindnessthis kindness will I showgo with me to a notary seal me thereyour single bond and in a merry sportif you repay me not on such a dayin such a place such sum or sums as areexpressed in the condition let the forfeitbe nominated for an equal poundof your fair flesh to be cut off and takenin what part of your body pleaseth mecontent infaith iull seal to such a bondand say there is much kindness in the Jewyou shall not seal to such a bond for meiull rather dwell in my necessitywhy fear not man I will not forfeit itwithin these two months thats a month beforethis bond expires I do expect returnof thrice three times the value of this bondO father Abram what these christians arewhose own hard dealing teaches them suspectthe thoughts of others pray you tell me thisif he should break his day what should I gainby the exaction of the forfeiturea pound of mans flesh taken from a manis not so estimable profitable neitheras flesh of muttons beefs or goats I sayto buy his favour I extend this friendshipif he will take it so if not adieuand for my love I pray you wrong me notyes Shylock I will seal unto this bondthen meet me forthwith at the notarysgive him direction for this merry bondand I will go and purse the ducats straightsee to my house left in the fearful guardof an unthrifty knave and presentlyI will be with youhie thee gentle Jewthis Hebrew will turn christian he grows kindI like not fair terms and a villains mindcome on in this there can be no dismaymy ships come home a month before the daymislike me not for my complexionthe shadowed livery of the burnished sunto whom I am a neighbour and near bredbring me the fairest creature northward bornwhere Phoebus fire scarce thaws the iclesand let us make insion for your loveto prove whose blood is reddest his or mineI tell thee lady this aspect of minehath feared the valiant by my love I swearthe best regarded virgins of our climehave loved it too I would not change this hueexcept to steal your thoughts my gentle queenin terms of choice I am not solely ledby nice direction of a maidens eyesbesides the lottery of my destinybars me the right of voluntary choosingbut if my father had not scanted meand hedged me by his wit to yield myselfhis wife who wins me by that means I told youyourself renowned prince then stood as fairas any comer I have looked on yetfor my affectioneven for that I thank youtherefore I pray you lead me to the casketsto try my fortune by this smitarthat slew the Sophy and a Persian princethat won three fields of Sultan SolymanI would outstare the sternest eyes that lookoutbrave the heart most daring on the earthpluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bearyea mock the lion when he roars for preyto win thee lady but alas the whileif Hercules and Lichas play at dicewhich is the better man the greater throwmay turn by fortune from the weaker handso is Aldes beaten by his pageand so may I blind fortune leading memiss that which one unworthier may attainand die with grievingyou must take your chanceand either not attempt to choose at allor swear before you choose if you choose wrongnever to speak to lady afterwardin way of marriage therefore be advisednor will not come bring me unto my chancefirst forward to the temple after dinneryour hazard shall be madegood fortune thento make me blest or cursedest among mencertainly my consence will serve me to run from this Jew my master the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot or good Gobbo or good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs

consence is but a kind of hard consence to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew the fiend gives the more friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I will runmaster young

Shylock and Bassaniowhat Jessical thou shalt not gormandizeas thou hast done with me what Jessicaland sleep and snore and rend apparel outwhy Jessica I saywhy Jessicawho bids thee call I do not

standhis hour is almost pastand it is marvel he out-dwells his hourfor lovers ever run before the clockO ten times faster Venus pigeons flyto seal loves bonds new-made than they are wontto keep obliged faith unforfeitedthat ever holds who riseth from a feastwith that keen appetite that he sits downwhere is the horse that doth untread againhis tedious measures with the unbated firethat he did pace them first All things that areare with more spirit chased than enjoyedhow like a younker or a prodigalthe scarfed bark puts from her native bayhugged and embraced by the strumpet windhow like the prodigal doth she returnwith over-weathered ribs and ragged sailslean rent and beggared by the strumpet windhere comes Lorenzo more of this hereaftersweet friends your patience for my long abodenot I but my affairs have made you waitwhen you shall please to play the thieves for wivesiull watch as long for you then Approachhere dwells my father Jew Ho whos withinwho are

am yoursheaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou arthere catch this casket it is worth the painsI am glad itis night you do not look on mefor I am much ashamed of my exchangebut love is blind and lovers cannot seethe pretty follies that themselves commitfor if they could Cupid himself would blushto see me thus transformed to a boydescend for you must be my torch-bearerwhat must I hold a candle to my shamesthey in themselves good sooth are too-too lightwhy itis an office of discovery loveand I should be obscuredso are you sweeteven in the lovely garnish of a boybut come at oncefor the close night doth play the runawayand we are stayed for at Bassanios feastI will make fast the doors and gild myselfwith some more ducats and be with you straightnow by my hood a gentile and no Jewbeshrew me but I love her heartilyfor she is wise if I can judge of herand fair she is if that mine eyes be trueand true she is as she hath proved herselfand therefore like herself wise fair and trueshall she be placed in my constant soulwhat art thou come on gentlemen awayour masquing mates by this time for us staywhos theresignior Antoniofie fie Gratiano where

inscription bearswho chooseth me shall gain what many men desirethe second silver which this promise carrieswho chooseth me shall get as much as he deservesthis third dull lead with warning all as bluntwho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hathhow shall I know if I do choose the rightthe one of them contains my picture princeif you choose that then I am yours withalsome god direct my judgment let me seeI will survey the inscriptions back againwhat says this leaden casketwho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hathmust give for what for lead hazard for leadthis casket threatens Men that hazard alldo it in hope of fair advantagesa golden mind stoops not to shows of drossiull then nor give nor hazard aught for leadwhat says the silver with her virgin huewho chooseth me shall get as much as he deservesas much as he deserves Pause there Moroccoand weigh thy value with an even handif thou beest rated by thy estimationthou dost deserve enough and yet enoughmay not extend so far as to the ladyand yet to be afeard of my deservingwere but a weak disabling of myselfas much as I deserve why thats the ladyI do in birth deserve her and in fortunesin graces and in qualities of breedingbut more than these in love I do deservewhat if I strayed no further but chose herelets see once more this saying graved in goldwho chooseth me shall gain what many men desirewhy thats the lady all the world desires herfrom the four corners of the earth they cometo kiss this shrine this mortal-breathing saintthe Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wildsof wide Arabia are as throughfares nowfor princes to come view fair Portiathe watery kingdom whose ambitious headspits in the face of heaven is no barto stop the foreign spirits but they comeas oer a brook to see fair Portiaone of these three contains her heavenly pictureisit like that lead contains her itwere damnationto think so base a thought it were too grossto rib her cerecloth in the obscure graveor shall I think in silver shes immuredbeing ten times undervalued to tried goldO sinful thought never so rich a gemwas set in worse than gold they have in Englanda coin that bears the figure of an angelstamped in gold but thats insculped uponbut here an angel in a golden bedlies all within Deliver me the keyhere do I choose and thrive I as I maythere take it prince and if my form lie therethen I am yoursO hell what have we herea carrion death within whose empty eyethere is a written scroll iull read the writingall that glisters is not goldoften have you heard that toldmany a man his life hath soldbut my outside to beholdgilded tombs do worms infoldhad you been as wise as boldyoung in limbs in judgment oldyour answer had not been inscrolledfare you well your suit is coldcold indeed and labour lostthen farewell heat and welcome frostportia adieu I have too grieved a heartto take a tedious leave thus losers parta gentle riddance draw the curtains golet all of his complexion choose me sowhy man I saw Bassanio under sailwith him is Gratiano gone alongand in their ship im sure Lorenzo is notthe villain Jew with outcries raised the dukewho went with him to search Bassanios shiphe came too late the ship was under sailbut there the duke was given to understandthat in a gondola were seen togetherlorenzo and his amorous Jessicabesides Antonio certified the dukethey were not with Bassanio in his shipI never heard a passion so confusedso strange outrageous and so variableas the dog Jew did utter in the streetsmy daughter O my ducats O my daughterfled with a christian O my christian ducatsjustice the law my ducats and my daughtera sealed bag two sealed bags of ducatsof double ducats stoln from me by my daughterand jewels two stones two rich and precious stonesstoln by my daughter Justice find the girlshe hath the stones upon her and the ducats why all the boys in Venice follow himcrying his stones his daughter and his ducatslet good Antonio look he keep his dayor he shall pay for thismarry well rememberedI reasoned with a Frenchman yesterdaywho told me in the narrow seas that partthe French and English there miscarrieda vessel of our country richly fraughtI thought upon Antonio when he told meand wished in silence that it were not hisyou were best to tell Antonio what you hearyet do not suddenly for it may grieve hima kinder gentleman treads not the earthI saw Bassanio and Antonio partbassanio told him he would make some speedof his return he answered edo not soslubber not business for my sake Bassaniobut stay the very riping of the timeand for the Jews bond which he hath of melet it not enter in your mind of lovebe merry and employ your chiefest thoughtsto courtship and such fair ostents of loveas shall conveniently become you there and even there his eye being big with tearsturning his face he put his hand behind himand with affection wondrous sensiblehe wrung Bassanios hand and so they partedI think he only loves the world for himI pray thee let us go and find him outand quicken his embraced heavinesswith some delight or otherdo we soquick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straightthe prince of Arragon hath taen his oathand comes to his election presentlybehold there stands the caskets noble princeif you choose that wherein I am containedstraight shall our nuptial rites be solemnizedbut if you fail without more speech my lordyou must be gone from hence immediatelyI am enjoined by oath to observe three thingsfirst never to unfold to any onewhich casket itwas I chose next if I failof the right casket never in my lifeto woo a maid in way of marriagelastlyif I do fail in fortune of my choiceimmediately to leave you and be goneto these injunctions every one doth swearthat comes to hazard for my worthless selfand so have I addressed me fortune nowto my hearts hope Gold silver and base leadwho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hathyou shall look fairer ere I give or hazardwhat says the golden chest ha let me seewho chooseth me shall gain what many men desirewhat many men desire that many may be meantby the fool multitude that choose by shownot learning more than the fond eye doth teachwhich pries not to the interior but like the martletbuilds in the weather on the outward walleven in the force and road of casualtyI will not choose what many men desirebecause I will not jump with common spiritsand rank me with the barbarous multitudewhy then to thee thou silver treasure-housetell me once more what title thou dost bearwho chooseth me shall get as much as he deservesand well said too for who shall go aboutto cozen fortune and be honourablewithout the stamp of merit let none presumeto wear an undeserved dignityO that estates degrees and officeswere not derived corruptly and that clear honourwere purchased by the merit of the wearerhow many then should cover that stand barehow many be commanded that commandhow much low peasantry would then be gleanedfrom the true seed of honour and how much honourpicked from the chaff and ruin of the timesto be new varnished well but to my choicewho chooseth me shall get as much as he deservesI will assume desert give me a key for thisand instantly unlock my fortunes heretoo long a pause for that which you find therewhats here the portrait of a blinking idiotpresenting me a schedule I will read ithow much unlike art thou to Portiahow much unlike my hopes and my deservingswho chooseth me shall have as much as he deservesdid I deserve no more than a fools headis that my prize are my deserts no betterto offend and judge are distinct officesand of opposed natureswhat is herethe fire seven times tried thisseven times tried that judgment isthat did never choose amisssome there be that shadows kisssuch have but a shadows blissthere be fools alive I wissilvered oer and so was thistake what wife you will to bedI will ever be your headso be gone sir you are spedstill more fool I shall appearby the time I linger herewith one fools head I came to woobut I go away with twosweet adieu iull keep my oathpatiently to bear my wroththus hath the candle singed the mothO these deliberate fools when they do choosethey have the wisdom by their wit to losethe anent saying is no heresyhanging and wiving goes by destiny come draw the curtain Nerissawhere is my ladyhere what would my lordmadam there is alighted at your gatea young Venetian one that comes beforeto signify the approaching of his lordfrom whom he bringeth sensible regreetsto wit besides commends and courteous breathgifts of rich value yet I have

fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her wordI would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio O that I had a title good enough to keep his name companycome the full stopha what sayst thou why the end is he hath lost a shipI would it might prove the end of his losseslet me say amen betimes lest the devil

wrong us shall we not revenge if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that if a Jew wrong a christian what is his humility revenge if a christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance

had of your daughter for a monkeyout upon her thou torturest me Tubal it was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeysbut Antonio is

merchandise I will go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue TubalI pray you tarry pause a day or twobefore you hazard for in choosing wrongI lose your company therefore forbear awhiletheres something tells me but it is not loveI would not lose you and you know yourselfhate counsels not in such a qualitybut lest you should not understand me welland yet a maiden hath no tongue but thoughtI would detain you here some month or twobefore you venture for me I could teach youhow to choose right but then I am forswornso will I never be so may you miss mebut if you do youll make me wish a sinthat I had been forsworn beshrew your eyesthey have oerlooked me and divided meone half of me is yours the other half yoursmine own I would say but if mine then yoursand so all yours O these naughty timesput bars between the owners and their rightsand so though yours not yours Prove it solet fortune go to hell for it not II speak too long but itis to peise the timeto eke it and to draw it out in lengthto stay you from electionlet me choosefor as I am I live upon the rackupon the rack Bassanio then confesswhat treason there is mingled with your lovenone but that ugly treason of mistrustwhich makes me fear th enjoying of my lovethere may as well be amity and lifebtween snow and fire as treason and my loveay but I fear you speak upon the rackwhere men enforced do speak anythingpromise me life and iull confess the truthwell then confess and liveconfess and lovehad been the very sum of my confessionO happy torment when my torturerdoth teach me answers for deliverancebut let me to my fortune and the casketsaway then I am locked in one of themif you do love me you will find me outnerissa and the rest stand all alooflet music sound while he doth make his choicethen if he lose he makes a swan-like endfading in music that the comparisonmay stand more proper my eye shall be the streamand watery death-bed for him he may winand what is music then then music iseven as the flourish when true subjects bowto a new-crowned monarch such it isas are those dulcet sounds in break of daythat creep into the dreaming bridegrooms earand summon him to marriage now he goeswith no less presence but with much more lovethan young Aldes when he did redeemthe virgin tribute paid by howling Troyto the sea-monster I stand for sacrificethe rest aloof are the Dardanian wiveswith bleared visages come forth to viewthe issue of the exploit go Herculeslive thou I live with much much more dismayI view the fight than thou that makest the fraytell me where is fancy bredor in the heart or in the headhow begot how nourishedreply replyit is engendered in the eyeswith gazing fed and fancy diesin the cradle where it lieslet us all ring fancys knelliull begin it Ding dong bellding dong bellso may the outward shows be least themselvesthe world is still deceived with ornamentin law what plea so tainted and corruptbut being seasoned with a gracious voiceobscures the show of evil in religionwhat damned error but some sober browwill bless it and approve it with a texthiding the grossness with fair ornamentthere is no vice so simple but assumessome mark of virtue on his outward partshow many cowards whose hearts are all as falseas stairs of sand wear yet upon their chinsthe beards of Hercules and frowning Marswho inward searched have livers white as milkand these assume but valours excrementto render them redoubted look on beautyand you shall see itis purchased by the weightwhich therein works a miracle in naturemaking them lightest that wear most of itso are those crisped snaky golden lockswhich make such wanton gambols with the windupon supposed fairness often knownto be the dowry of a second headthe skull that bred them in the sepulchrethus ornament is but the guiled shoreto a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarfveiling an Indian beauty in a wordthe seeming truth which cunning times put onto entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy goldhard food for Midas I will none of theenor none of thee thou pale and common drudgebtween man and man but thou thou meagre leadwhich rather threatnest than dost promise aughtthy plainness moves me more than eloquenceand here choose I joy be the consequencehow all the other passions fleet to airas doubtful thoughts and rash-embraced despairand shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousyO love be moderate allay thy ecstasyin measure rain thy joy scant this excessI feel too much thy blessing make it lessfor fear I surfeitwhat find I herefair Portias counterfeit what demi-godhath come so near creation Move these eyesor whether riding on the balls of mineseem they in motion here are severed lipsparted with sugar breath so sweet a barshould sunder such sweet friends here in her hairsthe painter plays the spider and hath wovena golden mesh to entrap the hearts of menfaster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyeshow could he see to do them having made onemethinks it should have power to steal both hisand leave itself unfurnished yet look how farthe substance of my praise doth wrong this shadowin underprizing it so far this shadowdoth limp behind the substance heres the scrollthe continent and summary of my fortuneyou that choose not by the viewchance as fair and choose as truesince this fortune falls to yoube content and seek no newif you be well pleased with thisand hold your fortune for your blissturn you where your lady isand claim her with a loving kissa gentle scroll fair lady by your leaveI come by note to give and to receivelike one of two contending in a prizethat thinks he hath done well in peoples eyeshearing applause and universal shoutgiddy in spirit still gazing in a doubtwhether those peals of praise be his or noso thrice-fair lady stand I even soas doubtful whether what I see be trueuntil confirmed signed ratified by youyou see me lord Bassanio where I standsuch as I am though for myself aloneI would not be ambitious in my wishto wish myself much better yet for youI would be trebled twenty times myselfa thousand times more fair ten thousand timesmore richthat only to stand high in your accountI might in virtues beauties livings friendsexceed account but the full sum of meis sum of nothing which to term in grossis an unlessoned girl unschooled unpractisedhappy in this she is not yet so oldbut she may learn happier than thisshe is not bred so dull but she can learnhappiest of all is that her gentle spiritcommits itself to yours to be directedas from her lord her governor her kingmyself and what is mine to you and yoursis now converted but now I was the lordof this fair mansion master of my servantsqueen oer myself and even now but nowthis house these servants and this same myselfare yours my lord I give them with this ringwhich when you part from lose or give awaylet it presage the ruin of your loveand be my vantage to exclaim on youmadam you have bereft me of all wordsonly my blood speaks to you in my veinsand there is such confusion in my powersas after some oration fairly spokeby a beloved prince there doth appearamong the buzzing pleased multitudewhere every something being blent togetherturns to a wild of nothing save of joyexpressed and not expressed but when this ringparts from this finger then parts life from henceO then be bold to say Bassanios deadmy lord and lady it is now our timethat have stood by and seen our wishes prosperto cry good joy Good joy my lord and ladymy lord Bassanio and my gentle ladyI wish you all the joy that you can wishfor I am sure you can wish none from meand when your honours mean to solemnizethe bargain of your faith I do beseech youeven at that time I may be married toowith all my heart so thou canst get a wifeI thank your lordship you have got me onemy eyes my lord can look as swift as yoursyou saw the mistress I beheld the maidyou loved I loved for intermissionno more pertains to me my lord than youyour fortune stood upon the caskets thereand so did mine too as the matter fallsfor wooing here until I sweat againand swearing till my very roof was drywith oaths of love at last if promise lastI got a promise of this fair one hereto have her love provided that your fortuneachieved her mistressis this true Nerissamadam it is so you stand pleased withaland do you Gratiano mean good faithyes faith my lordour feast shall be much honoured in your marriagewell play with them the first boy for a thousand ducatswhat and stake downno we shall neer win at that sport and stake downbut who comes here Lorenzo and his infidelwhat and my old Venetian friend Salaniolorenzo and Salanio welcome hitherif that the youth of my new interest herehave power to bid you welcome by your leaveI bid my very friends and countrymensweet Portia welcomeso do I my lordthey are entirely welcomeI thank your honour for my part my lordmy purpose was not to have seen you herebut meeting with Salanio by the wayhe did entreat me past all saying nayto come with him alongI did my lordand I have reason for it Signior Antoniocommends him to youere I ope his letterI pray you tell me how my good friend dothnot sick my lord unless it be in mindnor well unless in mind his letter therewill show you his estatenerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcomeyour hand Salanio whats the news from Venicehow doth that royal merchant good AntonioI know he will be glad of our successwe are the Jasons we have won the fleeceI would you had won the fleece that he hath lostthere are some shrewd contents in yon same paperthat steal the colour from Bassanios cheeksome dear friend dead else nothing in the worldcould turn so much the constitutionof any constant man what worse and worsewith leave Bassanio I am half yourselfand I must freely have the half of anythingthat this same paper brings youO sweet Portiahere are a few of the unpleasantest wordsthat ever blotted paper gentle ladywhen I did first impart my love to youI freely told you all the wealth I hadran in my veins I was a gentlemanand then I told you true and yet dear ladyrating myself at nothing you shall seehow much I was a braggart when I told youmy state was nothing I should then have told youthat I was worse than nothing for indeedI have engaged myself to a dear friendengaged my friend to his mere enemyto feed my means here is a letter ladythe paper as the body of my friendand every word in it a gaping woundissuing life-blood but is it true Salaniohath all his ventures failed what not one hitfrom Tripolis from Mexico and Englandfrom Lisbon Barbary and Indiaand not one vessel scape the dreadful touchof merchant-marring rocksnot one my lordbesides it should appear that if he hadthe present money to discharge the Jewhe would not take it never did I knowa creature that did bear the shape of manso keen and greedy to confound a manhe plies the duke at morning and at nightand doth impeach the freedom of the stateif they deny him justice twenty merchantsthe duke himself and the magnificoesof greatest port have all persuaded with himbut none can drive him from the envious pleaof forfeiture of justice and his bondwhen I was with him I have heard him swearto Tubal and to Chus his countrymenthat he would rather have Antonios fleshthan twenty times the value of the sumthat he did owe him and I know my lordif law authority and power deny notit will go hard with poor Antoniois it your dear friend that is thus in troublethe dearest friend to me the kindest manthe best-conditioned and unwearied spiritin doing courtesies and one in whomthe anent Roman honour more appearsthan any that draws breath in Italywhat sum owes he the Jewfor me three thousand ducatswhat no morepay him six thousand and deface the bonddouble six thousand and then treble thatbefore a friend of this descriptionshall lose a hair thorough Bassanios faultfirst go with me to church and call me wifeand then away to Venice to your friendfor never shall you lie by Portias sidewith an unquiet soul you shall have goldto pay the petty debt twenty times overwhen it is paid bring your true friend alongmy maid Nerissa and myself meantimewill live as maids and widows come awayfor you shall hence upon your wedding-daybid your friends welcome show a merry cheersince you are dear bought I will love you dearbut let me hear the letter of your friendsweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letterO love dispatch all business and be gonesince I have your good leave to go awayI will make haste but till I come againno bed shall eer be guilty of my staynor rest be interposer btwixt us twaingaoler look to him tell not me of mercythis is the fool that lent out money gratisgaoler look to himhear me yet good Shylockiull have my bond speak not against my bondI have sworn an oath that I will have my bondthou calledst me dog before thou hadst a causebut since I am a dog beware my fangsthe duke shall grant me justice I do wonderthou naughty gaoler that thou art so fondto come abroad with him at his requestI pray thee hear me speakiull have my bond I will not hear thee speakiull have my bond and therefore speak no moreiull not be made a soft and dull-eyed foolto shake the head relent and sigh and yieldto christian intercessors follow notiull have no speaking I will have my bondit is the most impenetrable curthat ever kept with menlet him aloneiull follow him no more with bootless prayershe seeks my life his reason well I knowI oft delivered from his forfeituresmany that have at times made moan to metherefore he hates meI am sure the dukewill never grant this forfeiture to holdthe duke cannot deny the course of lawfor the commodity that strangers havewith us in Venice if it be denieditwill much impeach the justice of the statesince that the trade and profit of the tyconsisteth of all nations therefore gothese griefs and losses have so bated methat I shall hardly spare a pound of fleshto-morrow to my bloody creditorwell gaoler on pray God Bassanio cometo see me pay his debt and then I care notmadam although I speak it in your presenceyou have a noble and a true conceitof god-like amity which appears most stronglyin bearing thus the absence of your lordbut if you knew to whom you show this honourhow true a gentleman you send reliefhow dear a lover of my lord your husbandI know you would be prouder of the workthan customary bounty can enforce youI never did repent for doing goodnor shall not now for in companionsthat do converse and waste the time togetherwhose souls do bear an equal yoke of lovethere must be needs a like proportionof lineaments of manners and of spiritwhich makes me think that this Antoniobeing the bosom lover of my lordmust needs be like my lord if it be sohow little is the cost I have bestowedin purchasing the semblance of my soulfrom out the state of hellish crueltythis comes too near the praising of myselftherefore no more of it hear other thingslorenzo I commit into your handsthe husbandry and manage of my houseuntil my lords return for mine own partI have toward heaven breathed a secret vowto live in prayer and contemplationonly attended by Nerissa hereuntil her husband and my lords returnthere is a monastery two miles offand there will we abide I do desire younot to deny this impositionthe which my love and some necessitynow lays upon youmadam with all my heartI shall obey you in all fair commandsmy people do already know my mindand will acknowledge you and Jessicain place of lord Bassanio and myselfso fare you well till we shall meet againfair thoughts and happy hours attend on youI wish your ladyship all hearts contentI thank you for your wish and am well pleasedto wish it back on you fare you well Jessicanow Balthazaras I have ever found thee honest-trueso let me find thee still take this same letterand use thou all the endeavour of a manin speed to Padua see thou render thisinto my cousins hand Doctor Bellarioand look what notes and garments he doth give theebring them I pray thee with imagined speedunto the traject to the common ferrywhich trades to Venice waste no time in wordsbut get thee gone I shall be there before theemadam I go with all convenient speedcome on Nerissa I have work in handthat you yet know not of well see our husbandsbefore they think of usshall they see usthey shall Nerissa but in such a habitthat they shall think we are accomplishedwith that we lack iull hold thee any wagerwhen we are both accoutred like young meniull prove the prettier fellow of the twoand wear my dagger with the braver graceand speak between the change of man and boywith a reed voice and turn two minng stepsinto a manly stride and speak of frayslike a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lieshow honourable ladies sought my lovewhich I denying they fell sick and diedI could not do withal then iull repentand wish for all that that I had not killed themand twenty of these puny lies iull tellthat men shall swear I have discontinued schoolabove a twelvemonth I have within my minda thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jackswhich I will practisewhy shall we turn to menfie what a questions thatif thou wert near a lewd interpreterbut come iull tell thee all my whole devicewhen I am in my coach which stays for usat the park gate and therefore haste awayfor we must measure twenty miles to-dayyes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter therefore be of good cheer for truly I think you are damned there is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neitherand what hope is that I pray theemarry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jews daughterthat were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon metruly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother well you are gone both waysI shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a christiantruly the more to blame he we were christians enow before een as many as could well live one by another this making of christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be pork-eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for moneyiull tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comesI shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into cornersnay you need not fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jews daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to christians you raise the price of porkI shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negros belly the Moor is with child by you Launcelotit is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her forhow every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinnerthat is done sir they have all stomachsgoodly lord what a wit-snapper are you then bid them prepare dinnerthat is done too sir only cover is the wordwill you cover then sirnot so sir neither I know my dutyyet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinnerfor the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall governO dear discretion how his words are suitedthe fool hath planted in his memoryan army of good words and I do knowa many fools that stand in better placegarnished like him that for a tricksy worddefy the matter how cheerest thou Jessicaand now good sweet say thy opinionhow dost thou like the lord Bassanios wifepast all expressing it is very meetthe lord Bassanio live an upright lifefor having such a blessing in his ladyhe finds the joys of heaven here on earthand if on earth he do not mean it thenin reason he should never come to heavenwhy if two gods should play some heavenly matchand on the wager lay two earthly womenand Portia one there must be something elsepawned with the other for the poor rude worldhath not her felloweven such a husbandhast thou of me as she is for a wifenay but ask my opinion too of thatI will anon first let us go to dinnernay let me praise you while I have a stomachno pray thee let it serve for table-talk then howsoeer thou speakest mong other things I shall digest itwell iull set you forthwhat is Antonio hereready so please your graceI am sorry for thee thou art come to answera stony adversary an inhuman wretchuncapable of pity void and emptyfrom any dram of mercyI have heardyour grace hath taen great pains to qualifyhis rigorous course but since he stands obdurateand that no lawful means can carry meout of his envys reach I do opposemy patience to his fury and am armedto suffer with a quietness of spiritthe very tyranny and rage of hisgo one and call the Jew into the courthes ready at the door he comes my lordmake room and let him stand before our faceshylock the world thinks and I think so toothat thou but leadest this fashion of thy maliceto the last hour of act and then itis thoughtthoult show thy mercy and remorse more strangethan is thy strange-apparent crueltyand where thou now exactest the penaltywhich is a pound of this poor merchants fleshthou wilt not only loose the forfeiturebut touched with human gentleness and loveforgive a moiety of the prinpalglanng an eye of pity on his lossesthat have of late so huddled on his backenow to press a royal merchant downand pluck commiseration of his statefrom brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flintfrom stubborn Turks and Tartars never trainedto offices of tender courtesywe all expect a gentle answer JewI have possessed your grace of what I purposeand by our holy Sabbath have I swornto have the due and forfeit of my bondif you deny it let the danger lightupon your charter and your tys freedomyoull ask me why I rather choose to havea weight of carrion flesh than to receivethree thousand ducats iull not answer thatbut say it is my humour is it answeredwhat if my house be troubled with a ratand I be pleased to give ten thousand ducatsto have it baned what are you answered yetsome men there are love not a gaping pigsome that are mad if they behold a catand others when the bagpipe sings inthe nosecannot contain their urine for affectionmistress of passion sways it to the moodof what it likes or loathes now for your answeras there is no firm reason to be renderedwhy he cannot abide a gaping pigwhy he a harmless necessary catwhy he a wauling bagpipe but of forcemust yield to such inevitable shameas to offend himself being offendedso can I give no reason nor I will notmore than a lodged hate and a certain loathingI bear Antonio that I follow thusa losing suit against him are you answeredthis is no answer thou unfeeling manto excuse the current of thy crueltyI am not bound to please thee with my answerdo all men kill the things they do not lovehates any man the thing he would not killevery offence is not a hate at firstwhat wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twiceI pray you think you question with the Jewyou may as well go stand upon the beachand bid the main flood bate his usual heightyou may as well use question with the wolfwhy he hath made the ewe bleat for the lambyou may as well forbid the mountain pinesto wag their high tops and to make no noisewhen they are fretted with the gusts of heavenyou may as well do anything most hardas seek to soften that than which whats harderhis Jewish heart therefore I do beseech youmake no more offers use no further meansbut with all brief and plain conveniencylet me have judgment and the Jew his willfor thy three thousand ducats here is sixif every ducat in six thousand ducatswere in six parts and every part a ducatI would not draw them I would have my bondhow shalt thou hope for mercy rendering nonewhat judgment shall I dread doing no wrongyou have among you many a purchased slavewhich like your asses and your dogs and mulesyou use in abject and in slavish partsbecause you bought them shall I say to youlet them be free marry them to your heirswhy sweat they under burdens let their bedsbe made as soft as yours and let their palatesbe seasoned with such viands you will answerthe slaves are ours so do I answer youthe pound of flesh which I demand of himis dearly bought itis mine and I will have itif you deny me fie upon your lawthere is no force in the decrees of VeniceI stand for judgment answer shall I have itupon my power I may dismiss this courtunless Bellario a learned doctorwhom I have sent for to determine thiscome here to-daymy lord here stays withouta messenger with letters from the doctornew come from Paduabring us the letters call the messengergood cheer Antonio what man courage yetthe Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and allere thou shalt lose for me one drop of bloodI am a tainted wether of the flockmeetest for death the weakest kind of fruitdrops earliest to the ground and so let meyou cannot better be employed Bassaniothan to live still and write mine epitaphcame you from Padua from Bellariofrom both my lord Bellario greets your gracewhy dost thou whet thy knife so earnestlyto cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt therenot on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jewthou makest thy knife keen but no metal canno not the hangmans axe bear half the keennessof thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce theeno none that thou hast wit enough to makeO be thou damned inexecrable dogand for thy life let justice be accusedthou almost makest me waver in my faithto hold opinion with Pythagorasthat souls of animals infuse themselvesinto the trunks of men thy currish spiritgoverned a wolf who hanged for human slaughtereven from the gallows did his fell soul fleetand whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed daminfused itself in thee for thy desiresare wolfish bloody starved and ravenoustill thou canst rail the seal from off my bondthou but offendest thy lungs to speak so loudrepair thy wit good youth or it will fallto cureless ruin I stand here for lawthis letter from Bellario doth commenda young and learned doctor to our courtwhere is hehe attendeth here hard byto know your answer whether youll admit himwith all my heart some three or four of yougo give him courteous conduct to this placemeantime the court shall hear Bellarios letteryour grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome his name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turned oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your graces request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendationyou hear the learned Bellario what he writesand here I take it is the doctor comegive me your hand Came you from old BellarioI did my lordyou are welcome take your placeare you acquainted with the differencethat holds this present question in the courtI am informed throughly of the causewhich is the merchant here and which the Jewantonio and old Shylock both stand forthis your name Shylockshylock is my nameof a strange nature is the suit you followyet in such rule that the Venetian lawcannot impugn you as you do proceedyou stand within his danger do you notay so he saysdo you confess the bondI dothen must the Jew be merfulon what compulsion must I tell me thatthe quality of mercy is not strainedit droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenupon the place beneath it is twice blessedit blesseth him that gives and him that takesitis mightiest in the mightiest it becomesthe throned monarch better than his crownhis sceptre shows the force of temporal powerthe attribute to awe and majestywherein doth sit the dread and fear of kingsbut mercy is above this sceptred swayit is enthroned in the hearts of kingsit is an attribute to God himselfand earthly power doth then show likest Godswhen mercy seasons justice therefore Jewthough justice be thy plea consider thisthat in the course of justice none of usshould see salvation we do pray for mercyand that same prayer doth teach us all to renderthe deeds of mercy I have spoke thus muchto mitigate the justice of thy pleawhich if thou follow this strict court of Venicemust needs give sentence gainst the merchant theremy deeds upon my head I crave the lawthe penalty and forfeit of my bondis he not able to discharge the moneyyes here I tender it for him in the courtyea twice the sum if that will not sufficeI will be bound to pay it ten times oeron forfeit of my hands my head my heartif this will not suffice it must appearthat malice bears down truth and I beseech youwrest once the law to your authorityto do a great right do a little wrongand curb this cruel devil of his willit must not be there is no power in Venicecan alter a decree establisheditwill be recorded for a precedentand many an error by the same examplewill rush into the state it cannot bea Daniel come to judgment yea a DanielO wise young judge how I do honour theeI pray you let me look upon the bondhere itis most reverend doctor here it isshylock theres thrice thy money offered theean oath an oath I have an oath in heavenshall I lay perjury upon my soulno not for Venicewhy this bond is forfeitand lawfully by this the Jew may claima pound of flesh to be by him cut offnearest the merchants heart be merfultake thrice thy money bid me tear the bondwhen it is paid according to the tenourit doth appear you are a worthy judgeyou know the law your expositionhath been most sound I charge you by the lawwhereof you are a well-deserving pillarproceed to judgment by my soul I swearthere is no power in the tongue of manto alter me I stay here on my bondmost heartily I do beseech the courtto give the judgmentwhy then thus it isyou must prepare your bosom for his knifeO noble judge O excellent young manfor the intent and purpose of the lawhath full relation to the penaltywhich here appeareth due upon the bonditis very true O wise and upright judgehow much more elder art thou than thy lookstherefore lay bare your bosomay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judgenearest his heart those are the very wordsit is so are there balance here to weighthe fleshI have them readyhave by some surgeon Shylock on your chargeto stop his wounds lest he do bleed to deathis it so nominated in the bondit is not so expressed but what of thatitwere good you do so much for charityI cannot find it itis not in the bondyou merchant have you anything to saybut little I am armed and well preparedgive me your hand Bassanio fare you wellgrieve not that I am fallen to this for youfor herein fortune shows herself more kindthan is her custom it is still her useto let the wretched man outlive his wealthto view with hollow eye and wrinkled browan age of poverty from which lingering penanceof such a misery doth she cut me offcommend me to your honourable wifetell her the process of Antonios endsay how I loved you speak me fair in deathand when the tale is told bid her be judgewhether Bassanio had not once a loverepent not you that you shall lose your friendand he repents not that he pays your debtfor if the Jew do cut but deep enoughiull pay it instantly with all my heartantonio I am married to a wifewhich is as dear to me as life itselfbut life itself my wife and all the worldare not with me esteemed above thy lifeI would lose all ay sacrifice them allhere to this devil to deliver youyour wife would give you little thanks for thatif she were by to hear you make the offerI have a wife whom I protest I loveI would she were in heaven so she couldentreat some power to change this currish Jewitis well you offer it behind her backthe wish would make else an unquiet housethese be the christian husbands I have a daughterwould any of the stock of Barabbashad been her husband rather than a christianwe trifle time I pray thee pursue sentencea pound of that same merchants flesh is thinethe court awards it and the law doth give itmost rightful judgeand you must cut this flesh from off his breastthe law allows it and the court awards itmost learned judge a sentence come preparetarry a little there is something elsethis bond doth give thee here no jot of bloodthe words expressly are a pound of flesh then take thy bond take thou thy pound of fleshbut in the cutting it if thou dost shedone drop of christian blood thy lands and goodsare by the laws of Venice confiscateunto the state of VeniceO upright judge mark Jew O learned judgeis that the lawthyself shalt see the actfor as thou urgest justice be assuredthou shalt have justice more than thou desirestO learned judge mark Jew a learned judgeI take this offer then pay the bond thriceand let the christian gohere is the moneysoftthe Jew shall have all justice soft no hastehe shall have nothing but the penaltyO Jew an upright judge a learned judgetherefore prepare thee to cut off the fleshshed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor morebut just a pound of flesh if thou takest moreor less than a just pound be it but so muchas makes it light or heavy in the substanceor the division of the twentieth partof one poor scruple nay if the scale do turnbut in the estimation of a hairthou diest and all thy goods are confiscatea second Daniel a Daniel Jewnow infidel I have thee on the hipwhy doth the Jew pause take thy forfeituregive me my prinpal and let me goI have it ready for thee here it ishe hath refused it in the open courthe shall have merely justice and his bonda Daniel still say I a second DanielI thank thee Jew for teaching me that wordshall I not have barely my prinpalthou shalt have nothing but the forfeitureto be so taken at thy peril Jewwhy then the devil give him good of itiull stay no longer questiontarry Jewthe law hath yet another hold on youit is enacted in the laws of Veniceif it be proved against an alienthat by direct or indirect attemptshe seek the life of any tizenthe party gainst the which he doth contriveshall seize one half his goods the other halfcomes to the privy coffer of the stateand the offenders life lies in the mercyof the duke only gainst all other voicein which predicament I say thou standestfor it appears by manifest proceedingthat indirectly and directly toothou hast contrived against the very lifeof the defendant and thou hast incurredthe danger formerly by me rehearseddown therefore and beg mercy of the dukebeg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyselfand yet thy wealth being forfeit to the statethou hast not left the value of a cordtherefore thou must be hanged at the states chargethat thou shalt see the difference of our spiritsI pardon thee thy life before thou ask itfor half thy wealth it is Antoniosthe other half comes to the general statewhich humbleness may drive into a fineay for the state not for Antonionay take my life and all pardon not thatyou take my house when you do take the propthat doth sustain my house you take my lifewhen you do take the means whereby I livewhat mercy can you render him Antonioa halter gratis nothing else for Gods sakeso please my lord the duke and all the courtto quit the fine for one half of his goodsI am content so he will let me havethe other half in use to render itupon his death unto the gentlemanthat lately stole his daughtertwo things provided more that for this favourhe presently become a christianthe other that he do record a gifthere in the court of all he dies possessedunto his son Lorenzo and his daughterhe shall do this or else I do recantthe pardon that I late pronounced hereart thou contented Jew what dost thou sayI am contentclerk draw a deed of giftI pray you give me leave to go from henceI am not well Send the deed after meand I will sign itget thee gone but do itin christening thou shalt have two godfathershad I been judge thou shouldst have had ten moreto bring thee to the gallows not the fontsir I entreat you home with me to dinnerI humbly do desire your grace of pardonI must away this night toward Paduaand it is meet I presently set forthI am sorry that your leisure serves you notantonio gratify this gentlemanfor in my mind you are much bound to himmost worthy gentleman I and my friendhave by your wisdom been this day acquittedof grievous penalties in lieu whereofthree thousand ducats due unto the Jewwe freely cope your courteous pains withaland stand indebted over and abovein love and service to you evermorehe is well paid that is well satisfiedand I delivering you am satisfiedand therein do account myself well paidmy mind was never yet more mercenaryI pray you know me when we meet againI wish you well and so I take my leavedear sir of force I must attempt you furthertake some remembrance of us as a tributenot as a fee grant me two things I pray younot to deny me and to pardon meyou press me far and therefore I will yieldgive me your gloves iull wear them for your sakeand for your love iull take this ring from youdo not draw back your hand iull take no moreand you in love shall not deny me thisthis ring good sir alas it is a trifleI will not shame myself to give you thisI will have nothing else but only thisand now methinks I have a mind to ittheres more depends on this than on the valuethe dearest ring in Venice will I give youand find it out by proclamationonly for this I pray you pardon meI see sir you are liberal in offersyou taught me first to beg and now methinksyou teach me how a beggar should be answeredgood sir this ring was given me by my wifeand when she put it on she made me vowthat I should never sell nor give nor lose itthat scuse serves many men to save their giftsan if your wife be not a mad-womanand know how well I have deserved the ringshe would not hold out enemy for everfor giving it to me well peace be with youmy lord Bassanio let him have the ringlet his deservings and my love withalbe valued gainst your wifes commandmentgo Gratiano run and overtake himgive him the ring and bring him if thou canstunto Antonios house away make hastecome you and I will thither presentlyand in the morning early will we bothfly toward Belmont come Antonioinquire the Jews house out give him this deedand let him sign it well away to-nightand be a day before our husbands homethis deed will be well welcome to Lorenzofair sir you are well oertaenmy lord Bassanio upon more advicehath sent you here this ring and doth entreatyour company at dinnerthat cannot behis ring I do accept most thankfullyand so I pray you tell him furthermoreI pray you show my youth old Shylocks housethat will I dosir I would speak with youiull see if I can get my husbands ringwhich I did make him swear to keep for everthou mayst I warrant we shall have old swearingthat they did give the rings away to menbut well outface them and outswear them tooaway make haste thou knowest where I will tarrycome good sir will you show me to this housethe moon shines bright in such a night as thiswhen the sweet wind did gently kiss the treesand they did make no noise in such a nighttroilus methinks mounted the Troyan wallsand sighed his soul toward the Grean tentswhere Cressid lay that nightin such a nightdid Thisbe fearfully oertrip the dewand saw the lions shadow ere himselfand ran dismayed awayin such a nightstood Dido with a willow in her handupon the wild sea-banks and waft her loveto come again to Carthagein such a nightmedea gathered the enchanted herbsthat did renew oldsonin such a nightdid Jessica steal from the wealthy Jewand with an unthrift love did run from Veniceas far as Belmontin such a nightdid young Lorenzo swear he loved her wellstealing her soul with many vows of faithand neer a true onein such a nightdid pretty Jessica like a little shrewslander her love and he forgave it herI would out-night you did no body comebut hark I hear the footing of a manwho comes so fast in silence of the nighta frienda friend what friend your name I pray you friendstephano is my name and I bring wordmy mistress will before the break of daybe here at Belmont she doth stray aboutby holy crosses where she kneels and praysfor happy wedlock hourswho comes with hernone but a holy hermit and her maidI pray you is my master yet returnedhe is not nor we have not heard from himbut go we in I pray thee Jessicaand ceremoniously let us preparesome welcome for the mistress of the housesola sola wo ha ho sola solawho callssola did you see master Lorenzomaster Lorenzo sola solaleave hollaing man heresola where whereheretell him theres a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morningsweet soul lets in and there expect their comingand yet no matter why should we go inmy friend Stephano signify I pray youwithin the house your mistress is at handand bring your music forth into the airhow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bankhere will we sit and let the sounds of musiccreep in our ears soft stillness and the nightbecome the touches of sweet harmonysit Jessica look how the floor of heavenis thick inlaid with patines of bright goldtheres not the smallest orb which thou beholdestbut in his motion like an angel singsstill quiring to the young-eyed cherubinssuch harmony is in immortal soulsbut whilst this muddy vesture of decaydoth grossly close it in we cannot hear itcome ho and wake Diana with a hymnwith sweetest touches pierce your mistress earand draw her home with musicI am never merry when I hear sweet musicthe reason is your spirits are attentivefor do but note a wild and wanton herdor race of youthful and unhandled coltsfetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loudwhich is the hot condition of their bloodif they but hear perchance a trumpet soundor any air of music touch their earsyou shall perceive them make a mutual standtheir savage eyes turned to a modest gazeby the sweet power of music therefore the poetdid feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floodssince nought so stockish hard and full of ragebut music for the time doth change his naturethe man that hath no music in himselfnor is not moved with concord of sweet soundsis fit for treasons stratagems and spoilsthe motions of his spirit are dull as nightand his affections dark as erebuslet no such man be trusted mark the musicthat light we see is burning in my hallhow far that little candle throws his beamsso shines a good deed in a naughty worldwhen the moon shone we did not see the candleso doth the greater glory dim the lessa substitute shines brightly as a kinguntil a king be by and then his stateempties itself as doth an inland brookinto the main of waters Music harkit is your music madam of the housenothing is good I see without respectmethinks it sounds much sweeter than by daysilence bestows that virtue on it madamthe crow doth sing as sweetly as the larkwhen neither is attended and I thinkthe nightingale if she should sing by daywhen every goose is cackling would be thoughtno better a musian than the wrenhow many things by season seasoned areto their right praise and true perfectionpeace ho the moon sleeps with Endymionand would not be awakedthat is the voiceor I am much deceived of Portiahe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckooby the bad voicedear lady welcome homewe have been praying for our husbands welfarewhich speed we hope the better for our wordsare they returnedmadam they are not yetbut there is come a messenger beforeto signify their cominggo in Nerissagive order to my servants that they takeno note at all of our being absent hencenor you Lorenzo Jessica nor youyour husband is at hand I hear his trumpetwe are no tell-tales madam fear you notthis night methinks is but the daylight sickit looks a little paler itis a daysuch as the day is when the sun is hidwe should hold day with the Antipodesif you would walk in absence of the sunlet me give light but let me not be lightfor a light wife doth make a heavy husbandand never be Bassanio so for mebut God sort all you are welcome home my lordI thank you madam give welcome to my friendthis is the man this is Antonioto whom I am so infinitely boundyou should in all sense be much bound to himfor as I hear he was much bound for youno more than I am well acquitted ofsir you are very welcome to our houseit must appear in other ways than wordstherefore I scant this breathing courtesyby yonder moon I swear you do me wrongin faith I gave it to the judges clerkwould he were gelt that had it for my partsince you do take it love so much at hearta quarrel ho already whats the matterabout a hoop of gold a paltry ringthat she did give me whose poesy wasfor all the world like cutlers poetryupon a knife love me and leave me not what talk you of the posy or the valueyou swore to me when I did give it youthat you would wear it till your hour of deathand that it should lie with you in your gravethough not for me yet for your vehement oathsyou should have been respective and have kept itgave it a judges clerk no Gods my judgethe clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had ithe will an if he live to be a manay if a woman live to be a mannow by this hand I gave it to a youtha kind of boy a little scrubbed boyno higher than thyself the judges clerka prating boy that begged it as a feeI could not for my heart deny it himyou were to blame I must be plain with youto part so slightly with your wifes first gifta thing stuck on with oaths upon your fingerand riveted so with faith unto your fleshI gave my love a ring and made him swearnever to part with it and here he standsI dare be sworn for him he would not leave itnor pluck it from his finger for the wealththat the world masters now in faith Gratianoyou give your wife too unkind a cause of griefan itwere to me I should be mad at itwhy I were best to cut my left hand offand swear I lost the ring defending itmy lord Bassanio gave his ring awayunto the judge that begged it and indeeddeserved it too and then the boy his clerkthat took some pains in writing he begged mineand neither man nor master would take aughtbut the two ringswhat ring gave you my lordnot that I hope that you received of meif I could add a lie unto a faultI would deny it but you see my fingerhath not the ring upon it it is goneeven so void is your false heart of truthby heaven I will neer come in your beduntil I see the ringnor I in yourstill I again see minesweet Portiaif you did know to whom I gave the ringif you did know for whom I gave the ringand would conceive for what I gave the ringand how unwillingly I left the ringwhen naught would be accepted but the ringyou would abate the strength of your displeasureif you had known the virtue of the ringor half her worthiness that gave the ringor your own honour to contain the ringyou would not then have parted with the ringwhat man is there so much unreasonableif you had pleased to have defended itwith any terms of zeal wanted the modestyto urge the thing held as a ceremonynerissa teaches me what to believeiull die forit but some woman had the ringno by my honour madam by my soulno woman had it but a civil doctorwhich did refuse three thousand ducats of meand begged the ring the which I did deny himand suffered him to go displeased awayeven he that did uphold the very lifeof my dear friend what should I say sweet ladyI was enforced to send it after himI was beset with shame and courtesymy honour would not let ingratitudeso much besmear it Pardon me good ladyfor by these blessed candles of the nighthad you been there I think you would have beggedthe ring of me to give the worthy doctorlet not that doctor eer come near my housesince he hath got the jewel that I lovedand that which you did swear to keep for meI will become as liberal as youiull not deny him anything I haveno not my body nor my husbands bedknow him I shall I am well sure of itlie not a night from home watch me like Argusif you do not if I be left alonenow by mine honour which is yet mine owniull have that doctor for my bedfellowand I his clerk therefore be well advisedhow you do leave me to mine own protectionwell do you so let me not take him thenfor if I do iull mar the young clerks penI am the unhappy subject of these quarrelssir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstandingportia forgive me this enforced wrongand in the hearing of these many friendsI swear to thee even by thine own fair eyeswherein I see myselfmark you but thatin both my eyes he doubly sees himselfin each eye one swear by your double selfand theres an oath of creditnay but hear mepardon this fault and by my soul I swearI never more will break an oath with theeI once did lend my body for his wealthwhich but for him that had your husbands ringhad quite miscarried I dare be bound againmy soul upon the forfeit that your lordwill never more break faith advisedlythen you shall be his surety give him thisand bid him keep it better than the otherhere lord Bassanio swear to keep this ringby heaven it is the same I gave the doctorI had it of him pardon me Bassaniofor by this ring the doctor lay with meand pardon me my gentle Gratianofor that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerkin lieu of this last night did lie with mewhy this is like the mending of highwaysin summer where the ways are fair enoughwhat are we cuckolds

absent then lie with my wifesweet lady you have given me life and livingfor here I read for certain that my shipsare safely come to roadhow now Lorenzomy clerk hath some good comforts too for youay and iull give them him without a feethere do I give to you and Jessicafrom the rich Jew a speal deed of giftafter his death of all he dies possessed offair ladies you drop manna in the

oil in his belly ashore at windsor how shall I be revenged on him I think the best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease did you ever hear

in this town her husbands name is fordwell sirI have long loved her and I protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engrossed opportunities to meet her feeed every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given Briefly I have pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions but whatsoever I have merited either in my mind or in my means meed I am sure I have received none unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say thislove like a shadow flies when substance love pursuespursuing that that flies and flying what pursueshave you received no promise of satisfaction at her handsneverhave you importuned her to such a purposeneverof what quality was your love thenlike a fair house built upon another mans ground so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected itto what purpose have you unfolded this to mewhen I have told you that I have told you all Some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her now sir John here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allowed for your many war-like court-like and learned preparationsO sirbelieve it for you know it there is money spend it spend it spend more spend all I have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this fords wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as anywould it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should win what you would enjoy Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterouslyO understand my drift she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked against now could I come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves I could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defences which now are too-too strongly embattled against me what say you toit sir Johnmaster Brook I will first make bold with your money next give me your hand and last as I am a gentleman you shall if you will enjoy fords wifeO good sirI say you shallwant no money sir John you shall want nonewant no mistress ford master Brook you shall want none I shall be with her I may tell you by her own appointment even as you came in to me her assistant or go-between parted from me I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth come you to me at night you shall know how I speedI am blest in your acquaintance do you know ford sirhang him poor cuckoldly knave I know him not yet I wrong him to call him poor they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogues coffer and theres my harvest-homeI would you knew ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw himhang him mechanical salt-butter rogue I will stare him out of his wits I will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor oer the cuckolds horns master Brook thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant and thou shalt he with his wife come to me soon at night fords a knave and I will aggravate his style thou master Brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold come to me soon at nightwhat a damned Epicurean rascal is this my heart is ready to crack with impatience who says this is improvident jealousy my wife hath sent to him the hour is fixed the match is made would any man have thought this See the hell of having a false woman my bed shall be abused my coffers ransacked my reputation gnawn at and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms and by him that does me this wrong Terms names Amaimon sounds well Lufer well Barbason well yet they are devils additions the names of fiends but Cuckold Wittol Cuckold

while you were therewhile I was thereand did he search for you and could not find youyou shall hear as good luck would have it comes in one mistress Page gives intelligence of fords approach and in her invention and fords wifes distraction they conveyed me into a buck-basketa buck-basketby the lord a buck-basket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master Brook there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostriland how long lay you therenay you shall hear master Brook what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good Being thus crammed in the basket a couple of fords knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went I for foul clothes but mark the sequel master Brook I suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable-fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the rcumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of that a man of my kidney think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to scape suffocation and in the height of this bath when I was more than half stewed in grease like a Dutch dish to be thrown into the Thames and cooled glowing hot in that surge like a horse-shoe think of that hissing hot think of that master Brookin good sadness sir I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all this my suit then is desperate youll undertake her no

eldest sonitwas where you wooed the gentlewoman so wellI have forgot your name but sure that partwas aptly fitted and naturally performedI think itwas Soto that your honour meansitis very true thou didst it excellentwell you are come to me in happy timethe rather for I have some sport in handwherein your cunning can assist me muchthere is a lord will hear you play to-nightbut I am doubtful of your modestieslest over-eyeing of his odd behaviourfor yet his honour never heard a playyou break into some merry passionand so offend him for I tell you sirsif you should smile he grows impatientfear not my lord we can contain ourselveswere he the veriest antick in the worldgo sirrah take them to the butteryand give them friendly welcome every onelet them want nothing that my house affordssirrah go you to Bartholmew my pageand see him dressed in all suits like a ladythat done conduct him to the drunkards chamberand call him madam do him obeisancetell him from me as he will win my lovehe bear himself with honourable actionsuch as he hath observed in noble ladiesunto their lords by them accomplishedsuch duty to the drunkard let him dowith soft low tongue and lowly courtesyand say what isit your honour will commandwherein your lady and your humble wifemay show her duty and make known her love and then with kind embracements tempting kissesand with declining head into his bosombid him shed tears as being overjoyedto see her noble lord restored to healthwho for this seven years hath esteemed himno better than a poor and loathsome beggarand if the boy have not a womans giftto rain a shower of commanded tearsan onion will do well for such a shiftwhich in a napkin being close conveyedshall in despite enforce a watery eyesee this dispatched with all the haste thou canstanon iull give thee more instructionsI know the boy will well usurp the gracevoice gait and action of a gentlewomanI long to hear him call the drunkard husbandand how my men will stay themselves from laughterwhen they do homage to this simple peasantiull in to counsel them haply my presencemay well abate the over merry spleenwhich otherwise would grow into extremesfor Gods sake a pot of small alewillit please your lordship drink a cup of sackwillit please your honour taste of these conserveswhat raiment will your honour wear to-dayI am Christophero Sly call not me honour nor lordship I neer drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef neer ask me what raiment iull wear for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometime more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the overleatherheaven cease this idle humour in your honourO that a mighty man of such descentof such possessions and so high esteemshould be infused with so foul a spiritwhat would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly old Slys son of Burtonheath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket the fat ale-wife of wincot if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom what I am not bestraught heresO this it is that makes your lady mournO this it is that makes your servants droophence comes it that your kindred shuns your houseas beaten hence by your strange lunacyO noble lord bethink thee of thy birthcall home thy anent thoughts from banishmentand banish hence these abject lowly dreamslook how thy servants do attend on theeeach in his office ready at thy beckwilt thou have music hark Apollo playsand twenty caged nightingales do singor wilt thou sleep well have thee to a couchsofter and sweeter than the lustful bedon purpose trimmed up for Semiramissay thou wilt walk we will bestrew the groundor wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trappedtheir harness studded all with gold and pearldost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soarabove the morning lark or wilt thou huntthy hounds shall make the welkin answer themand fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earthsay thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swiftas breathed stags ay fleeter than the roedost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straightadonis painted by a running brookand Cytherea all in sedges hidwhich seem to move and wanton with her breatheven as the waving sedges play with windwell show thee Io as she was a maidand how she was beguiled and surprisedas lively painted as the deed was doneor Daphne roaming through a thorny woodscratching her legs that one shall swear she bleedsand at that sight shall sad Apollo weepso workmanly the blood and tears are drawnthou art a lord and nothing but a lordthou hast a lady far more beautifulthan any woman in this waning ageand till the tears that she hath shed for theelike envious floods oer-run her lovely faceshe was the fairest creature in the worldand yet she is inferior to noneam I a lord and have I such a ladyor do I dream or have I dreamed till nowI do not sleep I see I hear I speakI smell sweet savours and I feel soft thingsupon my life I am a lord indeedand not a tinker nor Christophero Slywell bring our lady hither to our sightand once again a pot ofthe smallest alewillit please your mightiness to wash your handsO how we joy to see your wit restoredO that once more you knew but what you arethese fifteen years you have been in a dreamor when you waked so waked as if you sleptthese fifteen years by my fay a goodly napbut did I never speak of all that timeO yes my lord but very idle wordsfor though you lay here in this goodly chamberyet would you say ye were beaten out of doorand rail upon the hostess of the houseand say you would present her at the leetbecause she brought stone jugs and no sealed quartssometimes you would call out for cely Hacketay the womans maid of the housewhy sir you know no house nor no such maidnor no such men as you have reckoned upas Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greeceand Peter Turf and Henry Pimpernelland twenty more such names and men as thesewhich never were nor no man ever sawnow lord be thanked for my good amendsamenI thank thee thou shalt not lose by ithow fares my noble lordmarry I fare well for here is cheer enoughwhere is my wifehere noble lord what is thy will with herare you my wife and will not call me husbandmy men should call me lord I am your goodmanmy husband and my lord my lord and husbandI am your wife in all obedienceI know it well what must I call hermadamalce madam or Joan madammadam and nothing else so lords call ladiesmadam wife they say that I have dreamedand slept above some fifteen year or moreay and the time seems thirty unto mebeing all this time abandoned from your beditis much Servants leave me and her alonemadam undress you and come now to bedthrice noble lord let me entreat of youto pardon me yet for a night or twoor if not so until the sun be setfor your physians have expressly chargedin peril to incur your former maladythat I should yet absent me from your bedI hope this reason stands for my excuseay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in spite of the flesh and the bloodyour honours players hearing your amendmentare come to play a pleasant comedyfor so your doctors hold it very meetseeing too much sadness hath congealed your bloodand melancholy is the nurse of frenzytherefore they thought it good you hear a playand frame your mind to mirth and merrimentwhich bars a thousand harms and lengthens lifemarry I will let them play it is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trickno my good lord it is more pleasing stuffwhat household stuffit is a kind of historywell well seeit come madam wife sit by my sideand let the world slip we shall neer be youngertranio since for the great desire I hadto see fair Padua nursery of artsI am arrived for fruitful Lombardythe pleasant

treats of happinessby virtue speally to be achievedtell me thy mind for I have Pisa leftand am to Padua come as he that leavesa shallow plash to plunge him in the deepand with satiety seeks to quench his thirstmI perdonate gentle master mineI am in all affected as yourselfglad that you thus continue your resolveto suck the sweets of sweet philosophyonly good master while we do admirethis virtue and this moral displinelets be no stoics nor no stocks I prayor so devote to Aristotles checksas Ovid be an outcast quite abjuredbalk logic with acquaintance that you haveand practise rhetoric in your common talkmusic and poesy use to quicken youthe mathematics and the metaphysicsfall to them as you find your stomach serves youno profit grows where is no pleasure taenin brief sir study what you most affectgrameres Tranio well dost thou adviseif Biondello thou wert come ashorewe could at once put us in readinessand take a lodging fit to entertainsuch friends as time in Padua shall begetbut stay awhile what company is thismaster some show to welcome us to towngentlemen importune me no furtherfor how I firmly am resolved you knowthat is not to bestow my youngest daughterbefore I have a husband for the elderif either of you both love Katharinabecause I know you well and love you wellleave shall you have to court her at your pleasureto cart her rather shes too rough for methere there Hortensio will you any wifeI pray you sir is it your willto make a stale of me amongst these matesmates maid how mean you that no mates for youunless you were of gentler milder mouldinfaith sir you shall never need to fearI wis it is not half way to her heartbut if it were doubt not her care should beto comb your noddle with a three-legged stooland paint your face and use you like a foolfrom all such devils good lord deliver usand me too good lordhush master here is some good pastime towardthat wench is stark mad or wonderful frowardbut in the others silence do I seemaids mild behaviour and sobrietypeace Traniowell said master mum and gaze your fillgentlemen that I may soon make goodwhat I have said Bianca

can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights I will wish him to her fatherso will I Signior Gremio but a word I pray though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Biancas love to labour and effect one thing speallywhats that I praymarry sir to get a husband for her sistera husband a devilI say a husbandI say a devil thinkest thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to helltush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enoughI cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipped at the high-cross every morningfaith as you say theres small choice in rotten apples but come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping Baptistas eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have toit afresh sweet Bianca Happy man be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring how say you Signior GremioI am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her come onI pray sir tell me is it possiblethat love should of a sudden take such holdO Tranio till I found it to be trueI never thought it possible or likelybut see while idly I stood looking onI found the effect of love in idlenessand now in plainness do confess to theethat art to me as secret and as dearas Anna to the queen of Carthage wastranio I burn I pine I perish Tranioif I achieve not this young modest girlcounsel me Tranio for I know thou canstassist me Tranio for I know thou wiltmaster it is no time to chide you nowaffection is not rated from

longly on the maidperhaps you marked not whats the pith of allO yes I saw sweet beauty in her facesuch as the daughter of Agenor hadthat made great Jove to humble him to her handwhen with his knees he kissed the Cretan strandsaw you no more marked you not how her sisterbegan to scold and raise up such a stormthat mortal ears might hardly endure the dintranio I saw her coral lips to moveand with her breath she did perfume the airsacred and sweet was all I saw in hernay then itis time to stir him from his tranceI pray awake sir if you love the maidbend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it standsher elder sister is so curst and shrewdthat till the father rid his hands of hermaster your love must live a maid at homeand therefore has he closely mewed her upbecause she will not be annoyed with suitorsah Tranio what a cruel fathers hebut art thou not advised he took some careto get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct heray marry am I sir and now itis plottedI have it Traniomaster for my handboth our inventions meet and jump in onetell me thine firstyou will be schoolmasterand undertake the teaching of the maidthats your deviceit is may it

have it fullwe have not yet been seen in any housenor can we be distinguished by our facesfor man or master then it follows thusthou shalt be master Tranio in my steadkeep house and port and servants as I shouldI will some other be some Florentinesome Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisaitis hatched and shall be so Tranio at onceuncase thee take my coloured hat and cloakwhen Biondello comes he waits on theebut I will charm him first to keep his tongueso had you needin brief then sir sith it your pleasure isand I am tied to be obedientfor so your father charged me at our partingbe serviceable to my son quoth healthough I think itwas in another senseI am content to be Lucentiobecause so well I love Lucentiotranio be so because Lucentio lovesand let me be a slave to achieve that maidwhose sudden sight hath thralled my wounded eyehere comes the roguesirrah where have you beenwhere have I been nay how now where are youmaster has my fellow Tranio stoln your

Petruchio how do you all at Veronasignior Hortensio come you to part the fraycon tutto il cuore ben trovato may I sayalla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signior mio Petruchiorise Grumio rise we will compound this quarrelnay itis no matter sir what he leges in Latin if this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught I see two-and-thirty a pip outwhom would to God I had well knocked at firstthen had not Grumio come by the worsta senseless villain Good HortensioI bade the rascal knock upon your gateand could not get him for my heart to do itknock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words plain Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly and come you now with knocking at the gate sirrah be gone or talk not I advise youpetruchio patience I am Grumios pledgewhy thiss a heavy chance btwixt him and youyour anent trusty pleasant servant Grumioand tell me now sweet friend what happy galeblows you to Padua here from old Veronasuch wind as scatters young men through the worldto seek their fortunes further than at homewhere small experience grows but in a fewsignior Hortensio thus it stands with meantonio my father is deceasedand I have thrust myself into this mazehaply to wive and thrive as best I maycrowns in my purse I have and goods at homeand so am come abroad to see the worldpetruchio shall I then come roundly to theeand wish thee to a shrewd ill-favoured wifethouedst thank me but a little for my counseland yet iull promise thee she shall be richand very rich but thourt too much my friendand iull not wish thee to hersignior Hortensio btwixt such friends as wefew words suffice and therefore if thou knowone rich enough to be Petruchios wifeas wealth is burden of my wooing dancebe she as foul as was Florentius loveas old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewdas Socrates anthippe or a worseshe moves me not or not removes at leastaffections edge in me were she as roughas are the swelling Adriatic seasI come to wive it wealthily in Paduaif wealthily then happily in Paduanay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with neer a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses why nothing comes amiss so money comes withalpetruchio since we are stepped thus far inI will continue that I broached in jestI can Petruchio help thee to a wifewith wealth enough and young and beauteousbrought up as best becomes a gentlewomanher only fault and that is faults enoughis that she is intolerable curstand shrewd and froward so beyond all measurethat were my state far worser than it isI would not wed her for a mine of goldhortensio peace thou knowest not golds effecttell me her fathers name and itis enoughfor I will board her though she chide as loudas thunder when the clouds in autumn crackher father is Baptista Minolaan affable and courteous gentlemanher name is Katharina Minolarenowned in Padua for her scolding tongueI know her father though I know not herand he knew my deceased father wellI will not sleep Hortensio till I see herand therefore let me be thus bold with youto give you over at this first encounterunless you will accompany me thitherI pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts O my word an she knew him as well as I do she would think scolding would do little good upon him she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why thats nothing an he begin once hell rail in his ropetricks iull tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat you know him not sirtarry Petruchio I must go with theefor in Baptistas keep my treasure ishe hath the jewel of my life in holdhis youngest daughter beautiful Biancaand her withholds from me and other moresuitors to her and rivals in my lovesupposing it a thing impossiblefor those defects I have before rehearsedthat ever Katharina will be wooedtherefore this order hath Baptista taenthat none shall have access unto Biancatill Katharine the curst have got a husbandKatharine the cursta title for a maid of all titles the worstnow shall my friend Petruchio do me graceand offer me disguised in sober robesto old Baptista as a schoolmasterwell seen in music to instruct Biancathat so I may by this device at leasthave leave and leisure to make love to herand unsuspected court her by herselfheres no knavery See to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads togethermaster master look about you who goes there hapeace Grumio itis the rival of my lovepetruchio stand by awhilea proper stripling and an amorousO very well I

to her iull plead for youas for my patron stand you so assuredas firmly as yourself were still in placeyea and perhaps with more successful wordsthan you unless you were a scholar sirO this learning what a thing it isO this woodcock what an ass it ispeace sirrahgrumio mum God save you Signior Gremioand youre well met Signior Hortensiotrow you whither I am going to Baptista MinolaI

assisting you in allbut will you woo this wild-catwill I livewill he woo her ay or iull hang herwhy came I hither but to that intentthink you a little din can daunt mine earshave I not in my time heard lions roarhave I not heard the sea puffed up with windsrage like an angry boar chafed with sweathave I not heard great ordnance in the fieldand heavens artillery thunder in the skieshave I not in a pitched battle heardloud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clangand do you tell me of a womans tonguethat gives not half so great a blow to hearas will a chestnut in a farmers firetush tush fear boys with bugsfor he fears nonehortensio harkthis gentleman is happily arrivedmy mind presumes for his own good and oursI promised we would be contributorsand bear

love for that is all in allwhy that is nothing for I tell you fatherI am as peremptory as she proud-mindedand where two raging fires meet togetherthey do consume the thing that feeds their furythough little fire grows great with little windyet extreme gusts will blow out fire and allso I to her and so she yields to mefor I am rough and woo not like a babewell mayst thou woo and

I promise you if I look palewhat will my daughter prove a good musianI think shell sooner prove a soldieriron may hold with her but never luteswhy then thou canst not break her to the lutewhy no for she hath broke the lute to meI did but tell her she mistook her fretsand bowed her hand to teach her fingeringwhen with a most impatient devilish spiritfrets call you these quoth she iull fume with them and with that word she struck me on the headand through the instrument my pate made wayand there I stood amazed for a whileas on a pillory looking through the lutewhile she did call me rascal fiddlerand twangling Jack with twenty such vile termsas she had studied to misuse me sonow by the world it is a lusty wenchI love her ten times more than eer I didO how I long to have some chat with herwell go with me and be not so discomfitedproceed in practice with my younger daughtershes apt to learn and thankful for good turnssignior Petruchio will you go with usor shall I send

thee ranginghortensio will be quit with thee by changingsignior Lucentio this is the pointed daythat Katharine and Petruchio should be marriedand yet we hear not of our son-in-lawwhat will be said what mockery will it beto want the bridegroom when the priest attendsto speak the ceremonial rites of marriagewhat says Lucentio to this shame of oursno shame but mine I must forsooth be forcedto give my hand opposed against my heartunto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleenwho wooed in haste and means to wed at leisureI told you I he was a frantic foolhiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviourand to be noted for a merry manhell woo a thousand point the day of marriagemake friends invite and proclaim the bannsyet never means to wed where he hath wooednow must the world point at poor Katharineand say Lo there is mad Petruchios wifeif it would please him come and marry her patience good Katharine and Baptista tooupon my life Petruchio means but wellwhatever fortune stays him from his wordthough he be blunt I know him passing wisethough he be merry yet withal hes honestwould Katharine had never seen him thoughgo girl I cannot blame thee now to weepfor such an injury would vex a very saintmuch more a shrew of thy impatient humourmaster master news old news and such news as you never heard ofis it new and old too how may that bewhy is it not news to hear of Petruchios comingis he comewhy no sirwhat thenhe is comingwhen will he be herewhen he stands where I am and sees you therebut say what to thine old newswhy Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled another laced an old rusty sword taen out of the town-armoury with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten near-legged before and with a half-checked bit and a head-stall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times pieced and a womans crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthreadwho comes with himO sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fanes pricked init for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentlemans lackeyitis some odd humour pricks him to this fashionyet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparelledI am glad he is come howsoeer he comeswhy sir he comes notdidst thou not say he comeswho that Petruchio cameay that Petruchio cameno sir I say his horse comes with him on his backwhy thats all onenay by Saint JamyI hold you a pennya horse and a manis more than oneand yet not manycome where be these gallants who is at homeyou are welcome sirand yet I come not welland yet you halt notnot so well apparelledas I wish you werewere it better I should rush in thusbut where is Kate where is my lovely bridehow does my father gentles methinks you frownand wherefore gaze this goodly companyas if they saw some wondrous monumentsome comet or unusual prodigywhy sir you know this is your weddingdayfirst were we sad fearing you would not comenow sadder that you come so unprovidedfie doff this habit shame to your estatean eye-sore to our solemn festivaland tell us what occasion of importhath all so long detained you from your wifeand sent you hither so unlike yourselftedious it were to tell and harsh to hearsufficeth I am come to keep my wordthough in some part enforced to digresswhich at more leisure I will so excuseas you shall well be satisfied withalbut where is Kate I stay too long from herthe morning wears itis time we were at churchsee not your bride in these unreverent robesgo to my chamber put on clothes of minenot I believe me thus iull visit herbut thus I trust you will not marry hergood sooth even thus therefore ha done with wordsto me shes married not unto my clothescould I repair what she will wear in meas I can change these poor accoutrementsitwere well for Kate and better for myselfbut what a fool am I to chat with youwhen I should bid good morrow to my brideand seal the title with a lovely kisshe hath some meaning in his mad attirewe will persuade him be it possibleto put on better ere he go to churchiull after him and see the event of thisbut to her love concerneth us to addher fathers liking which to bring to passas I before imparted to your worshipI am to get a man whateer he beit skills not much well fit him to our turnand he shall be Vincentio of Pisaand make assurance here in Paduaof greater sums than I have promisedso shall you quietly enjoy your hopeand marry sweet Bianca with consentwere it not that my fellow schoolmasterdoth watch Biancas steps so narrowlyitwere good methinks to steal our marriagewhich once performed let all the world say noiull keep mine own despite of all the worldthat by degrees we mean to look intoand watch our vantage in this businesswell over-reach the greybeard Gremiothe narrow-prying father Minolathe quaint musian amorous Lioall for my masters sake Lucentiosignior Gremio came you from the churchas willingly as eer I came from schooland is the bride and bridegroom coming homea bridegroom say you itis a groom indeeda grumbling groom and that the girl shall findcurster than she why itis impossiblewhy hes a devil a devil a very fiendwhy shes a devil a devil the devils damtut shes a lamb a dove a fool to himiull tell you sir Lucentio when the priestshould ask if Katharine should be his wifeay by gogs-wouns quoth he and swore so loudthat all amazed the priest let fall the bookand as he stooped again to take it upthe mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuffthat down fell priest and book and book and priestnow take them up quoth he if any list what said the wench when he arose againtrembled and shook for why he stampt and sworeas if the vicar meant to cozen himbut after many ceremonies donehe calls for wine a health quoth he as ifhe had been aboard carousing to his matesafter a storm quaffed off the muscadeland threw the sops all in the sextons facehaving no other reasonbut that his beard grew thin and hungerlyand seemed to ask him sops as he was drinkingthis done he took the bride about the neckand kissed her lips with such a clamorous smackthat at the parting all the church did echoand I seeing this came thence for very shameand after me I know the rout is comingsuch a mad marriage never was beforehark hark I hear the minstrels playgentlemen and friends I thank you for your painsI know you think to dine with me to-dayand have prepared great store of wedding cheerbut so it is my haste doth call me henceand therefore here I mean to take my leaveisit possible you will away to-nightI must away to-day before night comemake it no wonder if you knew my businessyou would entreat me rather go than stayand honest company I thank you

Kate content thee prithee be not angryI will be angry what hast thou to dofather be quiet he shall stay my leisureay marry sir now it begins to workgentlemen forward to the bridal dinnerI see a

told you ofI pray you stand good father to me nowgive me Bianca for my patrimonysoft sonsir by your leave having come to Paduato gather in some debts my son Lucentiomade me acquainted with a

good fathers careto have him matched and if you please to likeno worse than I upon some agreementme shall you find ready and willingwith one consent to have her so bestowedfor curious I cannot be with yousignior Baptista of whom I hear so wellsir pardon me in what I have to sayyour plainness and your shortness please me wellright true it is your son Lucentio heredoth love my daughter and

and all is doneyour son shall have my daughter with consentI thank you sir where then do you know bestwe be affied and such assurance taenas shall with either parts agreement standnot in my house Lucentio for you knowpitchers have ears and I have many servantsbesides old Gremio is hearkening stilland happily we might be interruptedthen at my lodging an it like youthere doth my father lie

brought by you to the supperand thenthe old priest at Saint Lukes church is at your command at all hoursand what of all thisI cannot tell expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum to the church take the priest clerk and some suffient honest witnessesif this be not that you look for I have no more to saybut bid Bianca farewell for ever and a dayhearest thou BiondelloI cannot tarry I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir and so adieu sir my master hath appointed me to go to Saint Lukes to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendixI may and will if she be so contentedshe will be pleased then wherefore should I

woman oweth to her husbandand when shes froward peevish sullen sourand not obedient to his honest willwhat is she but a foul contending rebeland graceless traitor to her loving lordI am ashamed that women are so simpleto offer war where they should kneel for peaceor seek for rule supremacy and swaywhen they are bound to serve love and obeywhy are our bodies soft and weak and smoothunapt

this cellI do not think thou canst for then thou wast notout three years oldcertainly sir I canby what by any other house or personof anything the image tell me thathath kept with thy remembranceitis far offand rather like a dream than an assurancethat my remembrance warrants Had I notfour or five women once that tended methou hadst and more Miranda but how is itthat this lives in thy mind what seest thou elsein the dark backward and abysm of timeif thou rememberest aught ere thou camest herehow thou camest here thou mayestbut that I do nottwelve year since Miranda twelve year sincethy father was the duke of Milan anda prince of powersir are not you my fatherthy mother was a piece of virtue andshe said thou wast my daughter and thy fatherwas duke of Milan and his only heira princess no worse issuedO the heavenswhat foul play had we that we came from thenceor blessed wast we didboth both my girlby foul play as thou sayest were we heaved thencebut blessedly holp hitherO my heart bleedsto think ofthe teen that I have turned you towhich is from my remembrance please you furthermy brother and thy uncle called AntonioI pray thee mark me that a brother shouldbe so perfidious he whom next thyselfof all the world I loved and to him putthe manage of my state as at that timethrough all the signiories it was the firstand Prospero the prime duke being so reputedin dignity and for the liberal artswithout a parallel those being all my studythe government I cast upon my brotherand to my state grew stranger being transportedand rapt in secret studies thy false uncledost thou attend mesir most heedfullybeing once perfected how to grant suitshow to deny them who tadvance and whoto trash for over-topping

ivy which had hid my princely trunkand sucked my verdure out onit thou attendest notO good sir I doI pray thee mark meI thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicatedto closeness and the bettering of my mindwith that which but by being so retiredoerprized all popular rate in my false brotherawaked an evil nature and my trustlike a good parent did beget of hima falsehood in its contrary as greatas my trust was which had indeed no limita confidence sans bound he being thus lordednot only with what my revenue yieldedbut what my power might else exact like onewho having into truth by telling of itmade such a sinner of his memoryto credit his own lie he did believehe was indeed the duke out ofthe substitutionand executing th outward face of royaltywith all prerogative hence his ambition growingdost thou hearyour tale sir would cure deafnessto have no screen between this part he playedand him he played it for he needs will beabsolute Milan Me poor man my librarywas dukedom large enough of temporal royaltieshe thinks me now incapable confederatesso dry he was for sway winthe king of Naplesto give him annual tribute do him homagesubject his coronet to his crown and bendthe dukedom yet unbowed alas poor Milanto most ignoble stoopingO the heavensmark his condition and the event then tell meif this might be a brotherI should sinto think but nobly of my grandmothergood wombs have borne bad sonsnow the conditionthis king of Naples being an enemyto me inveterate hearkens my brothers suitwhich was that he in lieu ofthe premisesof homage and I know not how much tributeshould presently extirpate me and mineout of the dukedom and confer fair Milanwith all the honours on my brother whereona treacherous army levied one midnightfated to the purpose did Antonio openthe gates of Milan and inthe dead of darknessthe ministers for the purpose hurried thenceme and thy crying selfalack for pityI not remembring how I cried out thenwill cry it oer again it is a hintthat wrings mine eyes to thear a little furtherand then iull bring thee to the present businesswhich nows upon us without the which this storywere most impertinentwherefore did they notthat hour destroy uswell demanded wenchmy tale provokes that question dear they durst notso dear the love my people bore me nor seta mark so bloody on the business butwith colours fairer painted their foul endsin few they hurried us aboard a barkbore us some leagues to sea where they prepareda rotten carcass of a boat not riggednor tackle sail nor mast the very ratsinstinctively have quit it there they hoist usto cry to the sea that roared to us to sighto the winds whose pity sighing back againdid us but loving wrongalack what troublewas I then to youO a cherubinthou wast that did preserve me thou didst smileinfused with a fortitude from heavenwhen I have decked the sea with drops full saltunder my burden groaned which raised in mean undergoing stomach to bear upagainst what should ensuehow came we ashoreby providence divinesome food we had and some fresh water thata noble Neapolitan Gonzaloout of his charity who being then appointedmaster of this design did give us withrich garments linens stuffs and necessarieswhich since have steaded much so of his gentlenessknowing I loved my books he furnished mefrom mine own library with volumes thatI prize above my dukedomwould I mightbut ever see that mannow I arisesit still and hear the last of our sea-sorrowhere in this island we arrived and herehave I thy schoolmaster made thee more profitthan other princes can that have more timefor vainer hours and tutors not so carefulheavens thank you forit and now I pray you sirfor still itis beating in my

the beaknow in the waist the deck in every cabinI flamed amazement sometime id divideand burn in many places on the topmastthe yards and boresprit would I flame distinctlythen meet and join Joves lightnings the precursorsofthe dreadful thunder-claps more momentaryand sight-outrunning were not the fire and cracksof sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptuneseem to besiege and make his bold waves trembleyea his dread trident shakemy brave spiritwho was so firm so constant that this coilwould not infect his reasonnot a soulbut felt a fever of the mad and playedsome tricks of desperation All but marinersplunged in the foaming brine and quit the vesselthen all a-fire with me the kings son ferdinandwith hair up-staring then like reeds not hairwas the first man that leaped cried Hell is emptyand all the devils are here why thats my spiritbut was not this nigh shoreclose by my masterbut are they Ariel safenot a hair perishedon their sustaining garments not a blemishbut fresher than before and as thou badest mein troops I have dispersed them bout the islethe kings son have I landed by himselfwhom I left cooling of the air with sighsin an odd angle of the isle and sittinghis arms in this sad knotof the kings shipthe mariners say how thou hast disposedand all the rest ofthe fleetsafely in harbouris the kings ship in the deep nook where oncethou calledst me up at midnight to fetch dewfrom the still-vexed Bermoothes there shes hidthe mariners all under hatches stowedwho with a charm joined to their suffered labourI have left asleep and for the rest ofthe fleetwhich I dispersed they all have met againand are upon the Mediterranean flotebound sadly home for Naplessupposing that they saw the kings ship wrackedand his great person perishariel thy chargeexactly is performed but theres more workwhat is the time o th daypast the mid seasonat least two glasses the time btwixt six and nowmust by us both be spent

beyond our loss our hint of woeis common every day some sailors wifethe masters of some merchant and the merchanthave just our theme of woe but for the miracleI mean our preservation few in millionscan speak like us then wisely good sir weighour sorrow with our comfortprithee peacehe receives comfort like cold porridgethe visitor will not give him oer solook hes winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strikesirone tellwhen every grief is entertained thats offeredcomes to the entertainera dollardolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposedyou have taken it wiselier than I meant you shouldtherefore my lordfie what a spendthrift is he of his tongueI prithee sparewell I have done but yethe will be talkingwhich of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crowthe old cockthe cockereldone the wagera laughtera matchthough this island seem to be desertha ha ha so youre paiduninhabitable and almost inaccessibleyetyethe could not miss itit must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperancetemperance was a delicate wenchay and a subtle as he most learnedly deliveredthe air breathes upon us here most sweetlyas if it had lungs and rotten onesor as itwere perfumed by a fenhere is everything advantageous to lifetrue save means to liveof that theres none or littlehow lush and lusty the grass looks how greenthe ground indeed is tawnywith an eye of green inithe misses not muchno he doth but mistake the truth totallybut the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond creditas many vouched rarities arethat our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new-dyed than stained with salt waterif but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he liesay or very falsely pocket up his reportmethinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the kings fair daughter Claribel to the king of Tunisitwas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our returntunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queennot since widow Didos timewidow a pox o that how came that widow in Widow Didowhat if he had said widowerneas too Good lord how you take itwidow Dido said you you make me study of that she was of Carthage not of Tunisthis Tunis sir was CarthagecarthageI assure you Carthagehis word is more than the miraculous harphe hath raised the wall and houses toowhat impossible matter will he make easy nextI think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an appleand sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islandsaywhy in good timesir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queenand the rarest that eer came therebate I beseech you widow DidoO widow Dido ay widow Didois not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it I mean in a sortthat sort was well fished forwhen I wore it at your daughters marriageyou cram these words into mine ears againstthe stomach of my sense would I had nevermarried my daughter there for coming thencemy son is lost and in my rate she toowho is so far from Italy removedI neer again shall see her O thou mine heirof Naples and of Milan what strange fishhath made his meal on theesir he may liveI saw him beat the surges under himand ride upon their backs he trod the waterwhose enmity he flung aside and breastedthe surge most swoln that met him his bold headbove the contentious waves he kept and oaredhimself with his good arms in lusty stroketo the shore that oer his wave-worn basis bowedas stooping to relieve him I not doubthe came alive to landno no hes gonesir you may thank yourself for this great lossthat would not bless our Europe with your daughterbut rather lose her to an Africanwhere she at least is banished from your eyewho hath cause to wet the grief onitprithee peaceyou were kneeled to and importuned otherwiseby all of us and the fair soul herselfweighed between loathness and obedience atwhich end ofthe beam should bow we have lost your sonI fear for ever Milan and Naples havemore widows in them of this business makingthan we bring men to comfort them the faultsyour ownso is the dearest of the lossmy lord Sebastianthe truth you speak doth lack some gentlenessand time to speak it in you rub the sorewhen you should bring the plastervery welland most chirurgeonlyit is foul weather in us all good sirwhen you are cloudyfoul weathervery foulhad I plantation of this isle my lordheed sowt with nettle-seedor docks or mallowsand were the king onit what would I doscape being drunk for want of wineinthe commonwealth I would by contrariesexecute all things for no kind of trafficwould I admit no name of magistrateletters should not be known riches povertyand use of service none contract successionbourn bound of land tilth vineyard noneno use of metal corn or wine or oilno occupation all men idle alland women too but innocent and pureno sovereigntyyet he would be king onitthe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginningall things in common nature should producewithout sweat or endeavour treason felonysword pike knife gun or need of any enginewould I not have but nature should bring forthof its own kind all foison all abundanceto feed my innocent peopleno marrying mong his subjectsnone man all idle whores and knavesI would with such perfection govern sirto excel the golden agesave his majestylong live Gonzaloand do you mark me sirprithee no more thou dost talk nothing to meI do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothingitwas you we laughed atwho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing stillwhat a blow was there givenan it had not fallen flat-longyou are gentlemen of brave mettle you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changingwe would so and then go a-bat-fowlingnay good my lord be not angryno I warrant you I will not adventure my discretion so weakly Will you laugh me asleep for I am very heavygo sleep and hear uswhat all so soon asleep I wish mine eyeswould with themselves shut up my thoughts I findthey are inclined to do soplease you sirdo not omit the

sworn itis true travellers neer did liethough fools at home condemn themif in NaplesI should report this now would they believe meif I should say I saw such islandersfor certes these are people of the islandwho though they are of monstrous shape yet notetheir manners are more gentle-kind than ofour human generation you shall findmany nay almost anyhonest lordthou hast said well for some of you there presentare worse than devilsI cannot too much musesuch shapes such gesture and such sound expressingalthough they want the use of tongue a kindof excellent dumb discoursepraise in departingthey vanished strangelyno matter sincethey have left their viands behind for we have stomachswillit please you to taste of what is herenot Ifaith sir you need not fear when we were boyswho would believe that there were mountaineersdew-lapped like bulls whose throats had hanging at themwallets of flesh or that there were such menwhose heads stood in their breasts which now we

are three men of sin whom Destinythat hath to instrument this lower worldand what is init the never-surfeited seahath caused to belch up you and on this islandwhere man doth not inhabit you mongst menbeing most unfit to live I have made you madand even with such-like valour men hang and drowntheir proper selves you fools I and my fellowsare ministers of fate the elementsof whom your swords are tempered may as wellwound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabskill the still-closing waters as diminishone dowle thats in my plume my fellow-ministersare like invulnerable if you could hurtyour swords are now too massy for your strengthsand will not be uplifted but rememberfor thats my business to you that you threefrom Milan did supplant good Prosperoexposed unto the sea which hath requit ithim and his innocent child for which foul deedthe powers delaying not forgetting haveincensed the seas and shores yea all the creaturesagainst your peace Thee of thy son Alonsothey have bereft and do pronounce by melingering perdition worse than any deathcan be at once shall step by step attendyou and your ways whose wraths to guard you fromwhich here in this most desolate isle else fallsupon your heads is nothing but heart-sorrowand a clear life ensuingbravely the figure of this harpy hast thouperformed my Ariel a grace it had devouringof my instruction hast thou nothing batedin what thou hadst to say so with good lifeand observation strange my meaner ministerstheir several kinds have done my high charms workand these mine enemies are all knit upin their distractions they now are in my powerand in these fits I leave them while I visityoung ferdinand whom they suppose is drownedand his and mine loved darlingI the name of something holy sir why stand youin this strange stareO it is monstrous monstrousmethought the billows spoke and told me of itthe winds did sing it to me and the thunderthat deep and dreadful organ-pipe pronouncedthe

legions oeriull be thy secondall three of them are desperate their great guiltlike poison given to work a great time afternow gins to bite the spirits I do beseech youthat are of suppler joints follow them swiftlyand hinder them from what this ecstasymay now provoke them tofollow I pray youif I have too austerely punished youyour compensation makes amends for Ihave given you here a third of mine own lifeor that for which I live whom once againI tender to thy hand all thy vexationswere but my trials of thy love and thouhast strangely stood the test here afore HeavenI ratify this my rich gift O ferdinanddo not smile at me that I boast her offfor thou shalt find she will outstrip all praiseand make it halt behind herI do believe itagainst an oraclethen as my gift and thine own acquisitionworthily purchased take my daughter butif thou dost break her virgin knot beforeall sanctimonious ceremonies maywith full and holy rite be ministeredno sweet aspersion shall

togetherin the same fashion as you gave in chargejust as you left them all prisoners sirin the line-grove which weather-fends your cellthey cannot budge till your release the kinghis brother and yours abide all three distractedand the remainder mourning over thembrimful of sorrow and dismay but chieflyhim that you termed sir the good old lord Gonzalo his tears run down his beard like winters dropsfrom eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works themthat if you now beheld them your affectionswould become tenderdost thou think so spiritmine would sir were I humanand mine shallhast thou which art but air a touch a feelingof their afflictions and shall not myselfone of their kind that relish all as sharplypassion as they be kindlier moved than thou artthough with their high wrongs I am struck to the quickyet with my nobler reason gainst my furydo I take part the rarer action isin virtue than in vengeance they being penitentthe sole drift of my purpose doth extendnot a frown further go release them Arielmy charms iull break their senses iull restoreand they shall be themselvesiull fetch them sirye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and grovesand ye that on the sands with printless footdo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly himwhen he comes back you demi-puppets thatby moonshine do the green sour ringlets makewhereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastimeis to make midnight mushrooms that rejoiceto hear the solemn curfew by whose aidweak masters though ye be I have bedimmedthe noontide sun called forth the mutinous windsand btwixt the green sea and the azured vaultset roaring war to the dread-rattling thunderhave I given fire and rifted Joves stout oakwith his own bolt the strong-based promontoryhave I made shake and by the spurs plucked upthe pine and cedar graves at my commandhave waked their sleepers oped and let them forthby my so potent art but this rough magicI here abjure and when I have requiredsome heavenly music which even now I doto work mine end upon their senses thatthis airy charm is for iull break my staffbury it certain fathoms in the earthand deeper than did ever plummet soundiull drown my booka solemn air and the best comforterto an unsettled fancy cure thy brainsnow useless boiled within thy skull there standfor you are spell-stoppedholy Gonzalo honourable manmine eyes even soable to the show of thinefall fellowly drops the charm dissolves apaceand as the morning steals upon the nightmelting the darkness so their rising sensesbegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantletheir clearer reason O good Gonzalomy true preserver and a loyal sirto him thou followest I will pay thy graceshome both in word and deed most cruellydidst thou Alonso use me and my daughterthy brother was a furtherer in the actthourt pinched forit now Sebastian Flesh and bloodyou brother mine that entertained ambitionexpelled remorse and nature who with Sebastianwhose inward pinches therefore are most strongwould here have killed your king I do forgive theeunnatural though thou art Their understandingbegins to swell and the approaching tidewill shortly fill the

find the mariners asleepunder the hatches the master and the boatswainbeing awake enforce them to this placeand presently I pritheeI drink the air before me and returnor eer your pulse twice beatall torment trouble wonder and amazementinhabits here some heavenly power guide usout of this fearful countrybehold sir kingthe wronged duke of Milan Prosperofor more assurance that a living princedoes now speak to thee I embrace thy bodyand to thee and thy company I bida hearty welcomewher thou beest he or noor some enchanted trifle to abuse meas late I have been I not know thy pulsebeats as of flesh and blood and since I saw theeth affliction of my mind amends with whichI fear a madness held me this must cravean if this be at all a most strange storythy dukedom I resign and do entreatthou pardon me my wrongs but how should Prosperobe living and be herefirst noble friendlet me embrace thine age whose honour cannotbe measured or confinedwhether this beor

rankest fault all of them and requiremy dukedom of thee which perforce I knowthou must restoreif thou beest Prosperogive us particulars of thy preservationhow thou hast met us here who three hours sincewere wracked upon this shore where I have losthow sharp the point of this remembrance ismy dear son ferdinandI am woe forit sirirreparable is the loss and patiencesays it is past her cureI rather thinkyou have not sought her help of whose soft gracefor the like loss I have her sovereign aidand rest myself contentyou the like lossas great to me as late and supportableto make the dear loss have I means much weakerthan you may call to comfort you for Ihave lost my daughtera daughterO heavens that they were living both in Naplesthe king and queen there that they were I wishmyself were mudded in that oozy bedwhere my son lies when did you lose your daughterin this last tempest I perceive these lordsat this encounter do so much admirethat they devour their reason and scarce thinktheir eyes do offices of truth their wordsare natural breath but howsoeer you havebeen justled from your senses know for certainthat I am Prospero and that very dukewhich was thrust forth of Milan who most strangelyupon this shore where you were wracked was landedto be the lord onit no more yet of thisfor itis a chronicle of day by daynot a relation for a breakfast norbefitting this first meeting welcome sirthis cells my court here have I few attendantsand subjects none abroad pray you look inmy dukedom since you have given me againI will requite you with

heard renownbut never saw before of whom I havereceived a second life and second fatherthis lady makes him to meI am hersbut O how oddly will it sound that Imust ask my child forgivenessthere sir stoplet us not burden our remembranceswith a heaviness thats goneI have inly weptor should have spoke ere this look down you godsand on this couple drop a blessed crownfor it is you that have chalked forth the waywhich brought us hitherI say amen Gonzalowas Milan thrust from Milan that his issueshould become kings of Naples O rejoicebeyond a common joy and set it downwith gold

foundour king and company the next our shipwhich but three glasses since we gave out splitis tight and yare and bravely rigged as whenwe first put out to seasir all this servicehave I done since

lord Antoniowill money buy themvery like one of themis a plain fish and no doubt marketablemark but the badges of these men my lordsthen say if they be true this mis-shapen knavehis mother was a witch and one so strongthat could control the moon make flows and ebbsand deal in her command without her powerthese three have robbed me and this demidevilfor hes a bastard one had plotted with themto take my life two of these fellows youmust know and own this thing of darkness Iacknowledge mineI shall be pinched to deathis not this Stephano my drunken butlerhe is drunk now where had he wineand Trinculo is reeling-ripe where should theyfind this grand liquor that hath gilded themhow camest thou in this pickleI have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones I shall not fear fly-blowingwhy how now StephanoO touch me not I am not Stephano but a crampyoued be king of the isle sirrahI should have been a sore one thenthis is a strange thing as eer I looked onhe is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape go sirrah to my celltake with you your companions as you lookto have my pardon trim it handsomelyay that I will and iull be wise hereafterand seek for grace what a thrice-double asswas I to take this drunkard for a godand worship this dull foolgo to awayhence and bestow your luggage where you found itor stole it rathersir I invite your highness and your trainto my poor cell where you shall take your restfor this one night which part of it iull wastewith such discourse as I not doubt shall make itgo quick away the story of my lifeand the particular acdents gone bysince I came to this isle and in the morniull bring you to your ship and so to Napleswhere I have hope to see the nuptialof these our dear-beloved solemnizedand thence retire me to my Milan whereevery third thought shall be my graveI longto hear the story of your life which musttake the ear strangelyiull deliver alland promise you calm seas auspious galesand sail so expeditious that shall catchyour royal fleet far offmy Ariel chickthat is thy charge then to the elementsbe free and fare thou well please you draw nearnow my charms are all oerthrownand what strength I haves mine ownwhich is most faint now itis trueI must be here confined by youor sent to Naples let me notsince I have my dukedom gotand pardoned the deceiver dwellin this bare island by your spellbut release me from my bandswith the help of your good handsgentle breath of yours my sailsmust fill or else my project failswhich was to please now I wantspirits to enforce art to enchantand my ending is despairunless I be relieved by prayerwhich pierces so that it assaultsmercy itself and frees all faultsas you from crimes would pardoned belet your indulgence set me freecease to persuade my loving Proteushome-keeping youth have ever homely witswereit not affection chains thy tender daysto the sweet glances of thy honoured loveI rather would entreat thy companyto see the wonders of the world abroadthan living dully sluggardized at homewear out thy youth with shapeless idlenessbut since thou lovest love still and thrive thereineven as I would when I to love beginwilt thou be gone sweet Valentine adieuthink on thy Proteus when thou haply seestsome rare note-worthy object in thy travelwish me partaker in thy happinesswhen thou dost meet good hap and in thy dangerif ever danger do environ theecommend thy grievance to my holy prayersfor I will be thy beadsman Valentineand on a love-book pray for my successupon some book I love iull pray for theethats on some shallow story of deep lovehow young Leander crossed the Hellespontthats a deep story of a deeper lovefor he was more than over shoes in loveitis true for you are over boots in loveand yet you never swum the Hellespontover the boots nay give me not the bootsno I will not for it boots thee notwhatto be in love where scorn is bought with groanscoy looks with heart-sore sighs one fading moments mirthwith twenty watchful weary tedious nightsif haply won perhaps a hapless gainif lost why then a grievous labour wonhowever but a folly bought with witor else a wit by folly vanquishedso by your rcumstance you call me foolso by your rcumstance I fear youll proveitis love you cavil at I am not lovelove is your master for he masters youand he that is so yoked by a foolmethinks should not be chronicled for wiseyet writers say as in the sweetest budthe eating canker dwells so eating loveinhabits in the finest wits of alland writers say as the most forward budis eaten by the canker ere it bloweven so by love the young and tender witis turned to folly blasting in the budlosing his verdure even in the primeand all the fair effects of future hopesbut wherefore waste I time to counsel theethat art a votary to fond desireonce more adieu my father at the roadexpects my coming there to see me shippedand thither will I bring thee Valentinesweet Proteus no now let us take our leaveto Milan let me hear from thee by lettersof thy success in love and what news elsebetideth here in absence of thy friendand I likewise will visit thee with mineall happiness bechance to thee in Milanas much to you at home and so farewellhe after honour hunts I after lovehe leaves his friends to dignify them moreI leave myself my friends and all for lovethou Julia thou hast metamorphosed memade me neglect my studies lose my timewar with good counsel set the world at noughtmade wit with musing weak heart sick with thoughtsir Proteus save you Saw you my masterbut now he parted hence to embark for Milantwenty to one then he is shipped alreadyand I have played the sheep in losing himindeed a sheep doth very often strayan if the shepherd be a while awayyou conclude that my master is a shepherd then and I a sheepI dowhy then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleepa silly answer and fitting well a sheepthis proves me still a sheeptrue and thy master a shepherdnay that I can deny by a rcumstanceit shall go hard but iull prove it by anotherthe shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore I am no sheepthe sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheepsuch another proof will make me cry baa but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to Juliaay sir I a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labourheres too small a pasture for such store of muttonsif the ground be overcharged you were best stick hernay in that you are astray itwere best pound younay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letteryou mistake I mean the pound a pinfoldfrom a pound to a pin fold it over and overitis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your loverbut what said shedid she nodaynod ay why thats noddyyou mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and I say Ayand that set together is noddynow you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your painsno no you shall have it for bearing the letterwell I perceive I must be fain to bear with youwhy sir how do you bear with memarry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my painsbeshrew me but you have a quick witand yet it cannot overtake your slow pursecome come open the matter in brief what said sheopen your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once deliveredwell sir here is for your painswhat said shetruly sir I think youll hardly win herwhy couldst thou perceive so much from hersir I could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind I fear shell prove as hard to you in telling your mind give her no token but stones for shes as hard as steelwhat said she nothingno not so much as take this for thy pains to testify your bounty I thank you you have testerned me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir iull commend you to my mastergo go be gone to save your ship from wrackwhich cannot perish having thee aboardbeing destined to a drier death on shoreI must go send some better messengerI fear my Julia would not deign my linesreceiving them from such a worthless postbut say Lucetta now we are alonewouldst thou then counsel me to fall in loveay madam so you stumble not unheedfullyof all the fair resort of gentlementhat every day with parle encounter mein thy opinion which is worthiest loveplease you repeat their names iull show my mindaccording to my shallow simple skillwhat thinkest thou of the fair sir Eglamouras of a knight well-spoken neat and finebut were I you he never should be minewhat thinkest thou of the rich Mercatiowell of his wealth but of himself so sowhat thinkest thou of the gentle Proteuslord lord to see what folly reigns in ushow now what means this passion at his namepardon dear madam itis a passing shamethat I unworthy body as I amshould censure thus on lovely gentlemenwhy not on Proteus as of all the restthen thus of many good I think him bestyour reasonI have no other but a womans reasonI think him so because I think him soand wouldst thou have me cast my love on himay if you thought your love not cast awaywhy he of all the rest hath never moved meyet he of all the rest I think best loves yehis little speaking shows his love but smallfire thats closest kept burns most of allthey do not love that do not show their loveO they love least that let men know their loveI would I knew his mindperuse this paper madamto Julia Say from whomthat the contents will showsay say who gave it theesir Valentines page and sent I think from Proteushe would have given it you but I being in the waydid in your name receive it pardon the fault I praynow by my modesty a goodly brokerdare you presume to harbour wanton linesto whisper and conspire against my youthnow trust me itis an office of great worthand you an officer fit for the placethere take the paper see it be returnedor else return no more into my sightto plead for love deserves more fee than hatewill ye be gonethat you may ruminateand yet I would I had oerlooked the letterit were a shame to call her back againand pray her to a fault for which I chid herwhat fool is she that knows I am a maidand would not force the letter to my viewsince maids in modesty say no to thatwhich they would have the profferer construe Ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish lovethat like a testy babe will scratch the nurseand presently all humbled kiss the rodhow churlishly I child Lucetta hencewhen willingly I would have had her herehow angerly I taught my brow to frownwhen inward joy enforced my heart to smilemy penance is to call Lucetta backand ask remission for my folly pastwhat ho Lucettawhat would your ladyshipis it near dinner-timeI would it werethat you might kill your stomach on your meatand not upon your maidwhat isit that you took up so gingerlynothingwhy didst thou stoop thento take a paper upthat I let falland is that paper nothingnothing concerning methen let it lie for those that it concernsmadam it will not lie where it concernsunless it have a false interpretersome love of yours hath writ to you in rimethat I might sing it madam to a tunegive me a note your ladyship can setas little by such toys as may be possiblebest sing it to the tune of Light o love it is too heavy for so light a tuneheavy belike it hath some burden thenay and melodious were it would you sing itand why not youI cannot reach so highlets see your songhow now minionkeep tune there still so you will sing it outand yet methinks I do not like this tuneyou do notno madam it is too sharpyou minion are too saucynay now you are too flatand mar the concord with too harsh a descantthere wanteth but a mean to fill your songthe mean is drowned with your unruly bassindeed I bid the base for Proteusthis babble shall not henceforth trouble mehere is a coil with protestationgo get you gone and let the papers lieyou would be fingering them to anger meshe makes it strange but she would be best pleasedto be so angered with another letternay would I were so angered with the sameO hateful hands to tear such loving wordsinjurious wasps to feed on such sweet honeyand kill the bees that yield it with your stingsiull kiss each several paper for amendslook here is writ kind Julia unkind Juliaas in revenge of thy ingratitudeI throw thy name against the bruising stonestrampling contemptuously on thy disdainand here is writ love-wounded Proteus poor wounded name my bosom as a bedshall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healedand thus I search it with a sovereign kissbut twice or thrice was Proteus written downbe calm good wind blow not a word awaytill I have found each letter in the letterexcept mine own name that some whirlwind bearunto a ragged fearful hanging rockand throw it thence into the raging sealo here in one line is his name twice writpoor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteusto the sweet Julia that iull tear awayand yet I will not sith so prettilyhe couples it to his complaining namesthus will I fold them one upon anothernow kiss embrace contend do what you willmadamdinner is ready and your father stayswell let us gowhat shall these papers he like tell-tales hereif you respect them best to take them upnay I was taken up for laying them downyet here they shall not lie for catching coldI see you have a months mind to themay madam you may say what sights you seeI see things too although you judge I winkcome come willit please you gotell me Panthino what sad talk was thatwherewith my brother held you in the cloisteritwas of his nephew Proteus your sonwhy what of himhe wondered that your lordshipwould suffer him to spend his youth at homewhile other men of slender reputationput forth their sons to seek preferment outsome to the wars to try their fortune theresome to discover islands far awaysome to the studious universitiesfor any or for all these exerseshe said that Proteus your son was meetand did request me to importune youto let him spend his time no more at homewhich would be great impeachment to his agein having known to travel in his youthnor needest thou much importune me to thatwhereon this month I have been hammeringI have considered well his loss of timeand how he cannot be a perfect mannot being tried and tutored in the worldexperience is by industry achievedand perfected by the swift course of timethen tell me whither were I best to send himI think your lordship is not ignoranthow his companion youthful Valentineattends the emperor in his royal courtI know it wellitwere good I think your lordship sent him thitherthere shall be practise tilts and tournamentshear sweet discourse converse with noblemenand be in eye of every exerseworthy his youth and nobleness of birthI like thy counsel well hast thou advisedand that thou mayst perceive how well I like itthe execution of it shall make knowneven with the speediest expeditionI will dispatch him to the emperors courtto-morrow may it please you Don Alphonsowith other gentlemen of good esteemare journeying to salute the emperorand to commend their service to his willgood company with them shall Proteus goand in good time now will we break with himsweet love sweet lines sweet lifehere is her hand the agent of her hearthere is her oath for love her honours pawnO that our fathers would applaud our lovesto seal our happiness with their consentsO heavenly Juliahow now what letter are you reading theremayt please your lordship itis a word or twoof commendations sent from Valentinedelivered by a friend that came from himlend me the letter let me see what newsthere is no news my lord but that he writeshow happily he lives how well belovedand daily graced by the emperorwishing me with him partner of his fortuneand how stand you affected to his wishas one relying on your lordships willand not depending on his friendly wishmy will is something sorted with his wishmuse not that I thus suddenly proceedfor what I will I will and there an endI am resolved that thou shalt spend some timewith Valentinus in the emperors courtwhat maintenance he from his friends receiveslike exhibition thou shalt have from meto-morrow be in readiness to goexcuse it not for I am peremptorymy lord I cannot be so soon providedplease you deliberate a day or twolook what thou wantest shall be sent after theeno more of stay to-morrow thou must gocome on Panthino you shall be employedto hasten on his expeditionthus have I shunned the fire for fear of burningand drenched me in the sea where I am drownedI feared to show my father Julias letterlest he should take exceptions to my loveand with the vantage of mine own excusehath he excepted most against my loveO how this spring of love resembleththe uncertain glory of an April daywhich now shows all the beauty of the sunand by and by a cloud takes all awaysir Proteus your father calls for youhe is in haste therefore I pray you gowhy this it is my heart accords theretoand yet a thousand times it answers no sir your glovenot mine my gloves are onwhy then this may be yours for this is but oneha let me see ay give it me its minesweet ornament that decks a thing divineah Silvia Silviamadam Silvia madam Silviahow now sirrahshe is not within hearing sirwhy sir who bade you call heryour worship sir or else I mistookwell youll still be too forwardand yet I was last chidden for being too slowgo to sir Tell me do you know madam Silviashe that your worship loveswhy how know you that I am in lovemarry by these speal marks first you have learned like sir Proteus to wreathe your arms like a malecontent to relish a love-song like a robin-redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas you were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when I look on you I can hardly think you my masterare all these things perceived in methey are all perceived without yewithout me they cannotwithout you nay thats certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physian to comment on your maladybut tell me dost thou know my lady Silviashe that you gaze on so as she sits at supperhast thou observed that even she I meanwhy sir I know her notdost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet knowest her notis she not hard-favoured sirnot so fair boy as well-favouredsir I know that well enoughwhat dost thou knowthat she is not so fair as of you well-favouredI mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinitethats because the one is painted and the other out of all counthow painted and how out of countmarry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beautyhow esteemest thou me I account of her beautyyou never saw her since she was deformedhow long hath she been deformedever since you loved herI have loved her ever since I saw her and still I see her beautifulif you love her you cannot see herwhybecause love is blind O that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir Proteus for going ungarteredwhat should I see thenyour own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hosebelike boy then you are in love for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoestrue sir I was in love with my bed I thank you you swinged me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yoursin conclusion I stand affected to herI would you were set so your affection would ceaselast night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she lovesand have youI haveare they not lamely writno boy but as well as I can do thempeace here she comesO excellent motion O exceeding puppet now will he interpret to hermadam and mistress a thousand good morrowsO give ye good even heres a million of mannerssir Valentine and servant to you two thousandhe should give her interest and she gives it himas you enjoined me I have writ your letterunto the secret nameless friend of yourswhich I was much unwilling to proceed inbut for my duty to your ladyshipI thank you gentle servant itis very clerkly donenow trust me madam it came hardly offfor being ignorant to whom it goesI writ at random very doubtfullyperchance you think too much of so much painsno madam so it stead you I will writeplease you command a thousand times as muchand yeta pretty period well I guess the sequeland yet I will not name it and yet I care notand yet take this again and yet I thank youmeaning henceforth to trouble you no moreand yet you will and yet another yetwhat means your ladyship do you not like ityes yes the lines are very quaintly writbut since unwillingly take them againnay

when its writ for my sake read it overand if it please you so if not why soif it please me madam what thenwhy if it please you take it for your labourand so good morrow servantO jest unseen inscrutable invisibleas a nose on a mans face or a weathercock on a steeplemy master sues to her and she hath taught her suitorhe being her pupil to become her tutorO excellent device was there ever heard a betterthat my master being scribe to himself should write the letterhow now sir what are you reasoning with yourselfnay I was riming itis you that have the reasonto do whatto be a spokesman from madam Silviato whomto yourself why she wooes you by a figurewhat figureby a letter I should saywhy she hath not writ to mewhat need she when she hath made you write to yourself why do you not perceive the jestno believe meno believing you indeed sir but did you perceive her earnestshe gave me none except an angry wordwhy she hath given you a letterthats the letter I writ to her friendand that letter hath she delivered and there an endI would it were no worseiull warrant you itis as wellfor often have you writ to her and she in modestyor else for want of idle time could not again replyor fearing else some messenger that might her mind discoverherself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover all this I speak in print for in print I found itwhy muse you sir itis dinner-timeI have dineday but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on the air I am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat O be not like your mistress be moved be movedhave patience gentle JuliaI must where is no remedywhen possibly I can I will returnif you turn not you will return the soonerkeep this remembrance for thy Julias sakewhy then well make exchange here take you thisand seal the bargain with a holy kisshere is my hand for my true constancyand when that hour oerslips me in the daywherein I sigh not Julia for thy sakethe next ensuing hour some foul mischancetorment me for my loves forgetfulnessmy father stays my coming answer notthe tide is now nay not thy tide of tearsthat tide will stay me longer than I shouldjulia farewellwhat gone without a worday so true love should do it cannot speakfor truth hath better deeds than words to grace itsir Proteus you are stayed forgo I come I comealas

Thurio do you change colourgive him leave madam he is a kind of chameleonthat hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your airyou have said siray sir and done too for this timeI know it well sir you always end ere you begina fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot offitis indeed madam we thank the giverwho is that servantyourself sweet lady for you gave the fire sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyships looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your companysir if you spend word for word with me I shall make your wit bankruptI know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and I think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare wordsno more gentlemen no more here comes my fathernow daughter Silvia you are hard besetsir Valentine your fathers in good healthwhat say you to a letter from your friendsof much good newsmy lord I will be thankfulto any happy messenger from thenceknow ye Don Antonio your countrymanay my good lord I know the gentlemanto be of worth and worthy estimationand not without desert so well reputedhath he not a sonay my good lord a son that well deservesthe honour and regard of such a fatheryou know him wellI know him as myself for from our infancywe have conversed and spent our hours togetherand though myself have been an idle truantomitting the sweet benefit of timeto clothe mine age with angel-like perfectionyet hath sir Proteus for thats his namemade use and fair advantage of his dayshis years but young but his experience oldhis head unmellowed but his judgment ripeand in a word for far behind his worthcome all the praises that I now bestowhe is complete in feature and in mindwith all good grace to grace a gentlemanbeshrew me sir but if he make this goodhe is as worthy for an empress loveas meet to be an emperors counsellorwell sir this gentleman is come to mewith commendation from great potentatesand here he means to spend his time awhileI think itis no unwelcome news to youshould I have wished a thing it had been hewelcome him then according to his worthsilvia I speak to you and you sir Thuriofor Valentine I need not te him to itiull send him hither to you presentlythis is the gentleman I told your ladyshiphad come along with me but that his mistressdid hold his eyes locked in her crystal looksbelike that now she hath enfranchised themupon some other pawn for fealtynay sure I think she holds them prisoners stillnay then he should be blind and being blindhow could he see his way to seek out youwhy lady love hath twenty pairs of eyesthey say that love hath not an eye at allto see such lovers Thurio as yourselfupon a homely object love can winkhave done have done here comes the gentlemanwelcome dear Proteus mistress I beseech youconfirm his welcome with some speal favourhis worth is warrant for his welcome hitherif this be he you oft have wished to hear frommistress it is sweet lady entertain himto be my fellow-servant to your ladyshiptoo low a mistress for so high a servantnot so sweet lady but too mean a servantto have a look of such a worthy mistressleave off discourse of disabilitysweet lady entertain him for your servantmy duty will I boast of nothing elseand duty never yet did want his meedservant you are welcome to a worthless mistressiull die on him that says so but yourselfthat you are welcomethat you are worthlessmadam my lord your father would speak with youI wait upon his pleasurecome sir Thuriogo with me Once more new servant welcomeiull leave you to confer of home-affairswhen you have done we look to hear from youwell both attend upon your ladyshipnow tell me how do all from whence you cameyour friends are well and have them much commendedand how do yoursI left them all in healthhow does your lady and how thrives your lovemy tales of love were wont to weary youI know you joy not in a love-discourseay Proteus but that life is altered nowI have done penance for contemning lovewhose high imperious thoughts have punished mewith bitter fasts with penitential groanswith nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighsfor in revenge of my contempt of lovelove hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyesand made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrowO gentle Proteus loves a mighty lordand hath so humbled me as I confessthere is no woe to his correctionnor to his service no such joy on earthnow no discourse except it be of lovenow can I break my fast dine sup and sleepupon the very naked name of loveenough I read your fortune in your eyewas this the idol that you worship soeven she and is she not a heavenly saintno but she is an earthly paragoncall her divineI will not flatter herO flatter me for love delights in praiseswhen I was sick you gave me bitter pillsand I must minister the like to youthen speak the truth by her if not divineyet let her be a prinpalitysovereign to all the creatures on the earthexcept my mistresssweet except not anyexcept thou wilt except against my lovehave I not reason to prefer mine ownand I will help thee to prefer her tooshe shall be dignified with this high honourto bear my ladys train lest the base earthshould from her vesture chance to steal a kissand of so great a favour growing prouddisdain to root the summer-swelling flowerand make rough winter everlastinglywhy Valentine what braggardism is thispardon me Proteus all I can is nothingto her whose worth makes other worthies nothingshe is alonethen let her alonenot for the world why man she is mine ownand I as rich in having such a jewelas twenty seas if all their sand were pearlthe water nectar and the rocks pure goldforgive me that I do not dream on theebecause thou seeist me dote upon my lovemy foolish rival that her father likesonly for his possessions are so hugeis gone with her along and I must afterfor love thou knowest is full of jealousybut she loves youay and we are betrothed nay more our marriage-hourwith all the cunning manner of our flightdetermined of how I must climb her windowthe ladder made of cords and all the meansplotted and greed on for my happinessgood Proteus go with me to my chamberin these affairs to aid me with thy counselgo on before I shall inquire you forthI must unto the road to disembarksome necessaries that I needs must useand then iull presently attend youwill you make hasteI willeven as one heat another heat expelsor as one nail by strength drives out anotherso the remembrance of my former loveis by a newer object quite forgottenis it mine eye or Valentinus praiseher true perfection or my false transgressionthat makes me reasonless to reason thusshes fair and so is Julia that I lovethat I did love for now my love is thawedwhich like a waxen image gainst a firebears no impression of the thing it wasmethinks my zeal to Valentine is coldand that I love him not as I was wontO but I love his lady too-too muchand thats the reason I love him so littlehow shall I dote on her with more advicethat thus without advice begin to love heritis but her picture I have yet beheldand that hath dazzled my reasons lightbut when I look on her perfectionsthere is no reason but I shall be blindif I can check my erring love I willif not to compass her iull use my skilllaunce by mine honesty welcome to Milanforswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not welcome I reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say welcome come on you madcap iull to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes but sirrah how did thy master part with madam Juliamarry after they closed in earnest they parted very fairly in jestbut shall she marry himnohow then Shall he marry herno neitherwhat are they brokenno they are both as whole as a fishwhy then how stands the matter with themmarry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with herwhat an ass art thou I understand thee notwhat a block art thou that thou canst not my staff understands mewhat thou sayestay and what I do too look thee iull but lean and my staff understands meit stands under thee indeedwhy stand-under and under-stand is all onebut tell me true willit be a matchask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it willthe conclusion is then that it willthou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parableitis well that I get it so but Launce how sayest thou that my master is become a notable loverI never knew him otherwisethan howa notable lubber as thou reportest him to bewhy thou whoreson ass thou mistakest mewhy fool I meant not thee I meant thy masterI tell thee my master is become a hot loverwhy I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse so if not thou art a Hebrew a Jew and not worth the name of a christianwhybecause thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian wilt thou goat thy serviceto leave my Julia shall I be forswornto love fair Silvia shall I be forswornto wrong my friend I shall be much forswornand even that power which gave me first my oathprovokes me to this threefold perjurylove bade me swear and love bids me forswearO sweet-suggesting love if thou hast sinnedteach me thy tempted subject to excuse itat first I did adore a twinkling starbut now I worship a celestial sununheedful vows may heedfully be brokenand he wants wit that wants resolved willto learn his wit to exchange the bad for betterfie fie unreverend tongue to call her badwhose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferredwith twenty thousand soul-confirming oathsI cannot leave to love and yet I dobut there I leave to love where I should lovejulia I lose and Valentine I loseif I keep them I needs must lose myselfif I lose them thus find I by their lossfor Valentine myself for Julia SilviaI to myself am dearer than a friendfor love is still most precious in itselfand Silvia witness heaven that made her fairshows Julia but a swarthy EthiopeI will forget that Julia is aliveremembering that my love to her is deadand Valentine iull hold an enemyaiming at Silvia as a sweeter friendI cannot now prove constant to myselfwithout some treachery used to Valentinethis night he meaneth with a corded ladderto climb celestial Silvias chamber-windowmyself in counsel his competitornow presently iull give her father noticeof their disguising and pretended flightwho all enraged will banish Valentinefor Thurio he intends shall wed his daughterbut Valentine being gone iull quickly crossby some sly trick blunt Thurios dull proceedinglove lend me wings to make my purpose swiftas thou hast lent me wit to plot this driftcounsel Lucetta gentle girl assist meand een in kind love I do conjure theewho art the table wherein all my thoughtsare visibly charactered and engravedto lesson me and tell me some good meanhow with my honour I may undertakea journey to my loving Proteusalas the way is wearisome and longa true-devoted pilgrim is not wearyto measure kingdoms with his feeble stepsmuch less shall she that hath loves wings to flyand when the flight is made to one so dearof such divine perfection as sir Proteusbetter forbear till Proteus make returnO knowest thou not his looks are my souls foodpity the dearth that I have pined inby longing for that food so long a timedidst thou but know the inly touch of lovethou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snowas seek to quench the fire of love with wordsI do not seek to quench your loves hot firebut qualify the fires extreme ragelest it should burn above the bounds of reasonthe more thou dammest it up the more it burnsthe current that with gentle murmur glidesthou knowest being stopped impatiently doth ragebut when his fair course is not hinderedhe makes sweet music with th enamelled stonesgiving a gentle kiss to every sedgehe overtaketh in his pilgrimageand so by many winding nooks he strayswith willing sport to the wild oceanthen let me go and hinder not my courseiull be as patient as a gentle streamand make a pastime of each weary steptill the last step have brought me to my loveand there iull rest as after much turmoila blessed soul doth in Elysiumbut in what habit will you go alongnot like a woman for I would preventthe loose encounters of lasvious mengentle Lucetta fit me with such weedsas may beseem some well-reputed pagewhy then your ladyship must cut your hairno girl iull knit it up in silken stringswith twenty odd-conceited true-love knotsto be fantastic may become a youthof greater time than I shall show to bewhat fashion madam shall I make your breechesthat fits as well as Tell me good my lordwhat compass will you wear your farthingale why even what fashion thou best likest Lucettayou must needs have them with a cod-piece madamout out Lucetta that will be ill-favoureda round hose madam nows not worth a pinunless you have a cod-piece to stick pins onlucetta as thou lovest me let me havewhat thou thinkest meet and is most mannerlybut tell me wench how will the world repute mefor undertaking so unstaid a journeyI fear me it will make me scandalizedif you think so then stay at home and go notnay that I will notthen never dream on infamy but goif Proteus like your journey when you comeno matter whos displeased when you are goneI fear me he will scarce be pleased withalthat is the least Lucetta of my feara thousand oaths an ocean of his tearsand instances of infinite of lovewarrant me welcome to my Proteusall these are servants to deceitful menbase men that use them to so base effectbut truer stars did govern Proteus birthhis words are bonds his oaths are oracleshis love sincere his thoughts immaculatehis tears pure messengers sent from his hearthis heart as far from fraud as heaven from earthpray heaven he prove so when you come to himnow as thou lovest me do him not that wrongto bear a hard opinion of his truthonly deserve my love by loving himand presently go with me to my chamberto take a note of what I stand in need ofto furnish me upon my longing journeyall that is mine I leave at thy disposemy goods my lands my reputationonly in lieu thereof dispatch me hencecome answer not but to it presentlyI am impatient of my tarriancesir Thurio give us leave I pray awhilewe have some secrets to confer aboutnow tell me Proteus whats your will with memy gracious lord that which I would discoverthe law of friendship bids me to concealbut when I call to mind your gracious favoursdone to me undeserving as I ammy duty pricks me on to utter thatwhich else no worldly good should draw from meknow worthy prince sir Valentine my friendthis night intends to steal away your daughtermyself am one made privy to the plotI know you have determined to bestow heron Thurio whom your gentle daughter hatesand should she thus be stoln away from youit would be much vexation to your agethus for my dutys sake I rather choseto cross my friend in his intended driftthan by concealing it heap on your heada pack of sorrows which would press you downbeing unprevented to your timeless graveproteus I thank thee for thine honest carewhich to requite command me while I livethis love of theirs myself have often seenhaply when they have judged me fast asleepand oftentimes have purposed to forbidsir Valentine her company and my courtbut fearing lest my jealous aim might errand so unworthily disgrace the mana rashness that I ever yet have shunnedI gave him gentle looks thereby to findthat which thyself hast now disclosed to meand that thou mayst perceive my fear of thisknowing that tender youth is soon suggestedI nightly lodge her in an upper towerthe key whereof myself have ever keptand thence she cannot be conveyed awayknow noble lord they have devised a meanhow he her chamber-window will ascendand with a corded ladder fetch her downfor which the youthful lover now is goneand this way comes he with it presentlywhere if it please you you may intercept himbut good my lord do it so cunninglythat my discovery be not aimed atfor love of you not hate unto my friendhath made me publisher of this pretenceupon mine honour he shall never knowthat I had any light from thee of thisadieu my lord sir Valentine is comingsir Valentine whither away so fastplease it your grace there is a messengerthat stays to bear my letters to my friendsand I am going to deliver thembe they of much importthe tenour of them doth but signifymy health and happy being at your courtnay then no matter stay with me awhileI am to break with thee of some affairsthat touch me near wherein thou must be secretitis not unknown to thee that I have soughtto match my friend sir Thurio to my daughterI know it well my lord and sure the matchwere rich and honourable besides the gentlemanis full of virtue bounty worth and qualitiesbeseeming such a wife as your fair daughtercannot your grace win her to fancy himno trust me she is peevish sullen frowardproud disobedient stubborn lacking dutyneither regarding that she is my childnor fearing me as if I were her fatherand may I say to thee this pride of hersupon advice hath drawn my love from herand where I thought the remnant of mine ageshould have been cherished by her child-like dutyI now am full resolved to take a wifeand turn her out to who will take her inthen let her beauty be her wedding-dowerfor me and my possessions she esteems notwhat would your grace have me to do in thisthere is a lady of Verona herewhom I affect but she is nice and coyand nought esteems my aged eloquencenow therefore would I have thee to my tutorfor long agone I have forgot to courtbesides the fashion of the time is changedhow and which way I may bestow myselfto be regarded in her sun-bright eyewin her with gifts if she respect not wordsdumb jewels often in their silent kindmore than quick words do move a womans mindbut she did scorn a present that I sent hera woman sometime scorns what best contents hersend her another never give her oerfor scorn at first makes after-love the moreif she do frown itis not in hate of youbut rather to beget more love in youif she do chide itis not to have you gonefor why the fools are mad if left alonetake no repulse whatever she doth sayfor get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their gracesthough neer so black say they have angels facesthat man that hath a tongue I say is no manif with his tongue he cannot win a womanbut she I mean is promised by her friendsunto a youthful gentleman of worthand kept severely from resort of menthat no man hath access by day to herwhy then I would resort to her by nightay but the doors be locked and keys kept safethat no man hath recourse to her by nightwhat lets but one may enter at her windowher chamber is aloft far from the groundand built so shelving that one cannot climb itwithout apparent hazard of his lifewhy then a ladder quaintly made of cordsto cast up with a pair of anchoring hookswould serve to scale another Heros towerso bold Leander would adventure itnow as thou art a gentleman of bloodadvise me where I may have such a ladderwhen would you use it pray sir tell me thatthis very night for love is like a childthat longs for every thing that he can come byby seven oclock iull get you such a ladderbut hark thee I will go to her alonehow shall I best convey the ladder thitherit will be light my lord that you may bear itunder a cloak that is of any lengtha cloak as long as thine will serve the turnay my good lordthen let me see thy cloakiull get me one of such another lengthwhy any cloak will serve the turn my lordhow shall I fashion me to wear a cloakI pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon mewhat letter is this same whats here to Silviaand here an engine fit for my proceedingiull be so bold to break the seal for oncemy thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightlyand slaves they are to me that send them flyingO could their master come and go as lightlyhimself would lodge where senseless they are lyingmy herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest themwhile I their king that thither them importunedo curse the grace that with such grace hath blessed thembecause myself do want my servants fortuneI curse myself for they are sent by methat they should harbour where their lord would bewhats heresilvia this night I will enfranchise theeitis so and heres the ladder for the purposewhy Phaethon for thou art Merops sonwilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly carand with thy daring folly burn the worldwilt thou reach stars because they shine on theego basc intruder overweening slavebestow thy fawning smiles on equal matesand think my patience more than thy desertis privilege for thy departure hencethank me for this more than for all the favourswhich all too much I have bestowed on theebut if thou linger in my territorieslonger than swiftest expeditionwill give thee time to leave our royal courtby heaven my wrath shall far exceed the loveI ever borc my daughter or thyselfbe gone I will not hear thy vain excusebut as thou lovest thy life make speed from henceand why not death rather than living tormentto die is to be banished from myselfand Silvia is myself banished from heris self from self a deadly banishmentwhat light is light if Silvia be not seenwhat joy is joy if Silvia be not byunless it be to think that she is byand feed upon the shadow of perfectionexcept I be by Silvia in the nightthere is no music in the nightingaleunless I look on Silvia in the daythere is no day for me to look uponshe is my essence and I leave to beif I be not by her fair influencefostered

woe alreadyand now excess of it will make me surfeitdoth Silvia know that I am banisheday ay and she hath offered to the doomwhich unreversed stands in effectual forcea sea of melting pearl which some call tearsthose at her fathers churlish feet she tenderedwith them upon her knees her humble selfwringing her hands whose whiteness so became themas if but now they waxed pale for woebut neither bended knees pure hands held upsad sighs deep groans nor silver-shedding tearscould penetrate her uncompassionate sirebut Valentine if he be taen must diebesides her intercession chafed him sowhen she for thy repeal was suppliantthat to close prison he commanded herwith many bitter threats of biding thereno more unless the next word that thou speakesthave some malignant power upon my lifeif so I pray thee breathe it in mine earas ending anthem of my endless dolourcease to lament for that thou canst not helpand study help for that which thou lamentesttime is the nurse

who itis I love and yet itis a woman but what woman I will not tell myself and yet itis a milkmaid yet itis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet itis a maid for she is her masters maid and serves for wages she hath more qualities than a water-spaniel which is much in a bare christianhere is the catelog of her condition Imprimis she can fetch and carry why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade Item she can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean handshow now Signior Launce what news with your mastershipwith my

proves that thou canst not readcome fool come try me in thy paperthere and Saint Nicholas be thy speedimprimis she can milkay that she canitem she brews good aleand thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale item she can sewthats as much as to say can she soitem she can knitwhat need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stockitem she can wash and scoura speal virtue for then she need not be washed and scoureditem she can spinthen may I set the world on wheels when she can spin for her livingitem she hath many nameless virtuesthats as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no nameshere follow her vicesclose at the heels of her virtuesitem she is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breathwell that fault may be mended with a breakfast read onitem she hath a sweet mouththat makes amends for her sour breathitem she doth talk in her sleepits no matter for that so she sleep not in her talkitem she is slow in wordsO villain that set this down among her vices to be slow in words is a womans only virtue I pray thee out witht and place it for her chief virtueitem she is proudout with that too it was Eves legacy and cannot be taen from heritem she hath no teethI care not for that neither because I love crustsitem she is curstwell the best is she hath no teeth to biteitem she will often praise her liquorif her liquor be good she shall if she will not I will for good things should be praiseditem she is too liberalof her tongue she cannot for thats writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that iull keep shut now of another thing she may and that cannot I help well proceeditem she hath more hair than wit and more faults than hairs and more wealth than faultsstop there iull have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article Rehearse that once moreitem she hath more hair than witmore hair than wit it may be iull prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less whats nextand more faults than hairsthats monstrous O that that were outand more wealth than faultswhy that word makes the faults gracious well iull have her and if it be a match as nothing is impossiblewhat thenwhy then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the north-gatefor mefor thee ay who art thou he hath stayed for a better man than theeand must I go to himthou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turnwhy didst not tell me sooner pox of your love-lettersnow will he be swinged for reading my letter An unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets iull after to rejoice in the boys correctionsir Thurio fear not but that she will love younow Valentine is banished from her sightsince his exile she hath despised me mostforsworn my company and railed at methat I am desperate of obtaining herthis weak impress of love is as a figuretrenched in ice which with an hours heatdissolves to water and doth lose his forma little time will melt her frozen thoughtsand worthless Valentine shall be forgothow now sir Proteus is your countrymanaccording to our proclamation gonegone my good lordmy daughter takes his going grievouslya little time my lord will kill that griefso I believe but Thurio thinks not soproteus the good conceit I hold of theefor thou hast shown some sign of good desertmakes me the better to confer with theelonger than I prove loyal to your gracelet me not live to look upon your gracethou knowest how willingly I would effectthe match between sir Thurio and my daughterI do my lordand also I think thou art not ignoranthow she opposes her against my willshe did my lord when Valentine was hereay and perversely she persevers sowhat might we do to make the girl forgetthe love of Valentine and love sir Thuriothe best way is to slander Valentinewith falsehood cowardice and poor descentthree things that women highly hold in hateay but shell think that it is spoke in hateay if his enemy deliver ittherefore it must with rcumstance be spokenby one whom she esteemeth as his friendthen you must undertake to slander himand that my lord I shall be loath to doitis an ill office for a gentlemanespeally against his very friendwhere your good word cannot advantage himyour slander never can endamage himtherefore the office is indifferentbeing entreated to it by your friendyou have prevailed my lord if I can do itby aught that I can speak in his dispraiseshe shall not long continue love to himbut say this weed her love from Valentineit follows not that she will love sir Thuriotherefore as you unwind her love from himlest it should ravel and be good to noneyou must provide to bottom it on mewhich must be done by praising me as muchas you in worth dispraise sir Valentineand Proteus we dare trust you in this kindbecause we know on Valentines reportyou are already loves firm votaryand cannot soon revolt and change your mindupon this warrant shall you have accesswhere you with Silvia may confer at largefor she is lumpish heavy melancholyand for your friends sake will be glad of youwhere you may temper her by your persuasionto hate young Valentine and love my friendas much as I can do I will effectbut you sir Thurio are not sharp enoughyou must lay lime to tangle her desiresby wailful sonnets whose composed rimesshould be full-fraught with serviceable vowsaymuch is the force of heaven-bred poesysay that upon the altar of her beautyyou sacrifice your tears your sighs your heartwrite till your ink be dry and with your tearsmoist it again and frame some feeling linethat may discover such integrityfor Orpheus lute was strung with poets sinewswhose golden touch could soften steel and stonesmake tigers tame and huge leviathansforsake unsounded deeps to dance on sandsafter your dire-lamenting elegiesvisit by night your ladys chamber-windowwith some sweet consort to their instrumentstune a deploring dump the nights dead silencewill well become such sweet-complaining grievancethis or else nothing will inherit herthis displine shows thou hast been in loveand thy advice this night iull put in practicetherefore sweet Proteus my direction-giverlet us into the ty presentlyto sort some gentlemen well skilled in musicI have a sonnet that will serve the turnto give the onset to thy good adviceabout it gentlemenwell wait upon your grace till aftersupperand afterward determine our proceedingseven now about it I will pardon youfellows stand fast I see a passengerif there be ten shrink not but down with emstand sir and throw us that you have about yeif not well make you sit and rifle yousir we are undone these are the villainsthat all the travellers do fear so muchmy friendsthats not so sir we are your enemiespeace well hear himay by my beard will we for he is a proper manthen know that I have little wealth to losea man I am crossed with adversitymy riches are these poor habilimentsof which if you should here disfurnish meyou take the sum and substance that I havewhither travel youto Veronawhence came youfrom Milanhave you long sojourned theresome sixteen months and longer might have stayedif crooked fortune had not thwarted mewhat were you banished thenceI wasfor what offencefor that which now torments me to rehearseI killed a man whose death I much repentbut yet I slew him manfully in fightwithout false vantage or base treacherywhy neer repent it if it were done sobut were you banished for so small a faultI was and held me glad of such a doomhave you the tonguesmy youthful travel therein made me happyor else I often had been miserableby the bare scalp of Robin Hoods fat friarthis fellow were a king for our wild factionwell have him Sirs a wordmaster be one of themit is an honourable kind of thieverypeace villaintell us this have you anything to take tonothing but my fortuneknow then that some of us are gentlemensuch as the fury of ungoverned youththrust from the company of awful menmyself was from Verona banishedfor practising to steal away a ladyan heir and near allied unto the dukeand I from mantua for a gentlemanwho in my mood I stabbed unto the heartand I for such like petty crimes as thesebut to the purpose for we te our faultsthat they may hold excused our lawless livesand partly seeing you are beautifiedwith goodly shape and by your own reporta linguist and a man of such perfectionas we do in our quality much wantindeed because you are a banished mantherefore above the rest we parley to youare you content to be our generalto make a virtue of necessityand live as we do in this wildernesswhat sayest thou wilt thou be of our consortsay ay and be the captain of us allwell do thee homage and be ruled by theelove thee as our commander and our kingbut if thou scorn our courtesy thou diestthou shalt not live to brag what we have offeredI take your offer and will live with youprovided that you do no outrageson silly women or poor passengersno we detest such vile base practicescome go with us well bring thee to our crewsand show thee all the treasure we have gotwhich with ourselves all rest at thy disposealready have I been false to Valentineand now I must be as unjust to Thuriounder the colour of commending himI have access my own love to preferbut Silvia is too fair too true too holyto be corrupted with my worthless giftswhen I protest true loyalty to hershe twits me with my falsehood to my friendwhen to her beauty I commend my vowsshe bids me think how I have been forswornin breaking faith with Julia whom I lovedand notwithstanding all her sudden quipsthe least whereof would quell a lovers hopeyet spaniel-like the more she spurns my lovethe more it grows and fawneth on her stillbut here comes Thurio now must we to her windowand give some evening music to her earhow now sir Proteus are you crept before usay gentle Thurio for you know that lovewill creep in service where it cannot goay but I hope sir that you love not heresir but I do or else I would be hencewho Silviaay Silvia for your sakeI thank you for your own now gentlemenlets tune and to it lustily a whilenow my young guest methinks youre allycholly I pray you why is itmarry mine host because I cannot be merrycome well have you merry iull bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked forbut shall I hear him speakay that you shallthat will be musichark harkis he among theseay but peace lets hear emwho is Silvia what is shethat all our swains commend herholy fair and wise is shethe heaven such grace did lend herthat she might admired beis she kind as she is fairfor beauty lives with kindnesslove doth to her eyes repairto help him of his blindnessand being helped inhabits therethen to Silvia let us singthat Silvia is excellingshe excels each mortal thingupon the dull earth dwellingto her let us garlands bringhow now are you sadder than you were before how do you man the music likes you notyou mistake the musian likes me notwhy my pretty youthhe plays false fatherhow out of tune on the stringsnot so but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-stringsyou have a quick earay I would I were deaf it makes me have a slow heartI perceive you delight not in musicnot a whit when it jars sohark what fine change is in the musicay that change is the spiteyou would have them always play but one thingI would always have one play but one thingbut host doth this sir Proteus that we talk onoften resort unto this gentlewomanI will tell you what Launce his man told me he loved her out of all nickwhere is Launcegone to seek his dog which to-morrow by his masters command he must carry for a present to his ladypeace stand aside the company partssir Thurio fear not you I will so pleadthat you shall say my cunning drift excelswhere meet weat Saint Gregorys wellfarewellmadam good even to your ladyshipI thank you for your music gentlemenwho is that that spakeone lady if you knew his pure hearts truthyou would quickly learn to know him by his voicesir Proteus as I take itsir Proteus gentle lady and your servantwhat is your willthat I may compass yoursyou have your wish my will is even thisthat presently you chide you home to bedthou subtle perjured false disloyal manthinkest thou I am so shallow so conceitlessto be seduced by thy flatterythat hast deceived so many with thy vowsreturn return and make thy love amendsfor me by this pale queen of night I swearI am so far from granting thy requestthat I despise thee for thy wrongful suitand by and by intend to chide myselfeven for this time I spend in talking to theeI grant sweet love that I did love a ladybut she is deadtware false if I should speak itfor I am sure she is not buriedsay that she be yet Valentine thy friendsurvives to whom thyself art witnessI am betrothed and art thou not ashamedto wrong him with thy importunacyI likewise hear that Valentine is deadand so suppose am I for in his grave Assure thyself my love is buriedsweet lady let me rake it from the earthgo to thy ladys grave and call hers thenceor at the least in hers sepulchre thinehe heard not thatmadam if your heart be so obduratevouchsafe me yet your picture for my lovethe picture that is hanging in your chamberto that iull speak to that iull sigh and weepfor since the substance of your perfect selfis else devoted I am but a shadowand to your shadow will I make true loveif itwere a substance you would sure deceive itand make it but a shadow as I amI am very loath to be your idol sirbut since your falsehood shall become you wellto worship shadows and adore false shapessend to me in the morning and iull send itand so good restas wretches have oer nightthat wait for execution in the mornhost will you goby my halidom I was fast asleeppray you where lies sir Proteusmarry at my house trust me I think itis almost daynot so but it hath been the longest nightthat eer I watched and the most heaviestthis is the hour that madam Silviaentreated me to call and know her mindtheres some great matter sheed employ me inmadam

thus early come to know what serviceit is your pleasure to command me inO Eglamour thou art a gentlemanthink not I flatter for I swear I do notvaliant wise remorseful well-accomplishedthou art not ignorant what dear good willI bear unto the banished Valentinenor how my father would enforce me marryvain Thurio whom my very soul abhorsthyself hast loved and I have heard thee sayno grief did ever come so near thy heartas when thy lady and thy true love diedupon whose grave thou vowedst pure chastitysir Eglamour I would to Valentineto mantua where I hear he makes abodeand for the ways are dangerous to passI do desire thy worthy companyupon whose faith and honour I reposeurge not my fathers anger Eglamourbut think upon my grief a ladys griefand on the justice of my flying henceto keep me from a most unholy matchwhich heaven and fortune still rewards with plaguesI do desire thee even from a heartas full of sorrows as the sea of sandsto bear me company and go with meif not to hide what I have said to theethat I may venture to depart alonemadam I pity much your grievanceswhich since I know they virtuously are placedI give consent to go along with yourecking as little what betideth meas much I wish all good befortune youwhen will you gothis evening comingwhere shall I meet youat Friar Patricks cellwhere I intend holy confessionI will not fail your ladyshipgood morrow gentle ladygood morrow kind sir Eglamourwhen a mans servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that I brought up of a puppy one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say presely thus would I teach a dog I was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg O itis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things if I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hanged forit sure as I live he had suffered forit you shall judge he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the dukes table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing-while but all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says one what cur is that says another whip him out says the third hang him up says the duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs friend quoth I you mean to whip the dog Ay marry do I quoth he you do him the more wrong quoth I itwas I did the thing you wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber how many masters would do this for his servant nay iull be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered forit thou thinkest not of this now nay I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of madam Silvia did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale didst thou ever see me do such a tricksebastian is thy name I like thee welland will employ thee in some service presentlyin what you please I will do what I canI hope thou wilthow now you whoreson peasantwhere have you been these two days loiteringmarry sir I carried mistress Silvia the dog you bade meand what says she to my little jewelmarry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a presentbut she received my dogno indeed did she not here have I brought him back againwhat didst thou offer her this from meay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace and then I offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greatergo get thee hence and find my dog againor neer return again into my sightaway I say Stayest thou to vex me herea slave that still an end turns me to shamesebastian I have entertained theepartly that I have need of such a youththat can with some discretion do my businessforit is no trusting to yond foolish loutbut chiefly for thy face and thy behaviourwhich if my augury deceive me notwitness good bringing up fortune and truththerefore know thou for this I entertain theego presently and take this ring with theedeliver it to madam Silviashe loved me well delivered it to meit seems you loved not her to leave her tokenshes dead belikenot so I think she livesalaswhy dost thou cry alas I cannot choosebut pity herwherefore shouldest thou pity herbecause methinks that she loved you as wellas you do love your lady Silviashe dreams on him that has forgot her loveyou dote on her that cares not for your loveitis pity love should be so contraryand thinking on it makes me cry alas well well give her that ring and therewithalthis letter thats her chamber Tell my ladyI claim the promise for her heavenly pictureyour message done chide home unto my chamberwhere thou shalt find me sad and solitaryhow many women would do such a messagealas poor Proteus thou hast entertaineda fox to be the shepherd of thy lambsalas poor fool why do I pity himthat with his very heart despiseth mebecause he loves her he despiseth mebecause I love him I must pity himthis ring I gave him when he parted from meto bind him to remember my good willand now am I unhappy messengerto plead for that which I would not obtainto carry that which I would have refusedto praise his faith which I would have dispraisedI am my masters true-confirmed lovebut cannot be true servant to my masterunless I prove false traitor to myselfyet will I woo for him but yet so coldlyas heaven it knows I would not have him speedgentlewoman good day I pray you be my meanto bring me where to speak with madam Silviawhat would you with her if that I be sheif you be she I do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message I am sent onfrom whomfrom my master sir Proteus madamO he sends you for a pictureay madamursula bring my picture therego give your master this tell him from meone Julia that his changing thoughts forgetwould better fit his chamber than this shadowmadam please you peruse this letterpardon me madam I have unadviseddelivered you a paper that I should notthis is the letter to your ladyshipI pray thee let me look on that againit may not be good madam pardon methere holdI will not look upon your masters linesI know they are stuffed with protestationsand full of new-found oaths which he will breakas easily as I do tear his papermadam he sends your ladyship this ringthe more shame for him that he sends it mefor I have heard him say a thousand timeshis Julia gave it him at his departurethough his false finger have profaned the ringmine shall not do his Julia so much wrongshe thanks youwhat sayest thouI thank you madam that you tender herpoor gentlewoman my master wrongs her muchdost thou know heralmost as well as I do know myselfto think upon her woes I do protestthat I have wept a hundred several timesbelike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook herI think she doth and thats her cause of sorrowis she not passing fairshe hath been fairer madam than she iswhen she did think my master loved her wellshe in my judgment was as fair as youbut since she did neglect her looking-glassand threw her sun-expelling mask awaythe air hath starved the roses in her cheeksand pinched the lily-tincture of her facethat now she is become as black as Ihow tall was sheabout my stature for at Pentecostwhen all our pageants of delight were playedour youth got me to play the womans partand I was trimmed in madam Julias gownwhich served me as fit by all mens judgmentsas if the garment had been made for metherefore I know she is about my heightand at that time I made her weep agoodfor I did play a lamentable partmadam itwas Ariadne passioningfor Theseus perjury and unjust flightwhich I so lively acted with my tearsthat my poor mistress moved therewithalwept bitterly and would I might be deadif I in thought felt not her very sorrowshe is beholding to thee gentle youthalas poor lady desolate and leftI weep myself to think upon thy wordshere youth there is my purse I give thee thisfor thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovest herfarewelland she shall thank you forit if eer you know hera virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautifulI hope my masters suit will be but coldsince she respects my mistress love so muchalas how love can trifle with itselfhere is her picture let me see I thinkif I had such a tire this face of minewere full as lovely as is this of hersand yet the painter flattered her a littleunless I flatter with myself too muchher hair is auburn mine is perfect yellowif that be all the difference in his loveiull get me such a coloured periwigher eyes are grey as glass and so are mineay but her foreheads low and mines as highwhat should it be that he respects in herbut I can make respective in myselfif this fond love were not a blinded godcome shadow come and take this shadow upfor itis thy rival O thou senseless formthou shalt be worshipped kissed loved and adoredand were there sense in his idolatrymy substance should be statue in thy steadiull use thee kindly for thy mistress sakethat used me so or else by Jove I vowI should have scratched out your unseeing eyesto make my master out of love with theethe sun begins to gild the western skyand now it is about the very hourthat Silvia at Friar Patricks cell should meet meshe will not fail for lovers break not hoursunless it be to come before their timeso much they spur their expeditionsee where she comeslady a happy eveningamen amen go on good Eglamourout at the postern by the abbey-wallI fear I am attended by some spiesfear not the forest is not three leagues offif we recover that were sure enoughsir Proteus what says Silvia to my suitO sir I find her milder than she wasand yet she takes exceptions at your personwhat that my leg is too longno that it is too littleiull wear a boot to make it somewhat rounderbut love will not be spurred to what it loatheswhat says she to my faceshe says it is a fair onenay then the wanton lies my face is blackbut pearls are fair and the old saying isblack men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes itis true such pearls as put out ladies eyesfor I had rather wink than look on themhow likes she my discourseill when you talk of warbut well when I discourse of love and peacebut better indeed when you hold your peacewhat says she to my valourO sir she makes no doubt of thatshe needs not when she knows it cowardicewhat says she to my birththat you are well derivedtrue from a gentleman to a foolconsiders she my possessionsO ay and pities themwhereforethat such an ass should owe themthat they are out by leasehere comes the dukehow now sir Proteus how now Thuriowhich of you saw sir Eglamour of latenot Inor Isaw you my daughterneitherwhy thenshes fled unto that peasant Valentineand Eglamour is in her companyitis true for Friar Laurence met them bothas he in penance wandered through the foresthim he knew well and guessed that it was shebut being masked he was not sure of itbesides she did intend confessionat Patricks cell this even and there she was notthese likelihoods confirm her flight from hencetherefore I pray you stand not to discoursebut mount you presently and meet with meupon the rising of the mountain-footthat leads towards mantua whither they are fleddispatch sweet gentlemen and follow mewhy this it is to be a peevish girlthat flies her fortune when it follows heriull after more to be revenged on Eglamourthan for the love of reckless Silviaand I will follow more for Silvias lovethan hate of Eglamour that goes with herand I will follow more to cross that lovethan hate for Silvia that is gone for lovecome comebe patient we must bring you to our captaina thousand more mischances than this onehave learned me how to brook this patientlycome bring her awaywhere is the gentleman that was with herbeing nimble-footed he hath outrun usbut Moyses and Valerius follow himgo thou with her to the west end of the woodthere is our captain well follow him thats fledthe thicket is beset he cannot scapecome I must bring you to our captains cavefear not he bears an honourable mindand will not use a woman lawlesslyO Valentine this I endure for theehow use doth breed a habit in a manthis shadowy desart unfrequented woodsI better brook than flourishing peopled townshere can I sit alone unseen of anyand to the nightingales complaining notestune my distresses and record my woesO thou that dost inhabit in my breastleave not the mansion so long tenantlesslest growing ruinous the building falland leave no memory of what it wasrepair me with thy presence Silviathou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swainwhat halloing and what stir is this to-daythese are my mates that make their wills their lawhave some unhappy passenger in chasethey love me well yet I have much to doto keep them from unvil outrageswithdraw thee Valentine whos this comes heremadam this service I have done for youthough you respect not aught your servant dothto hazard life and rescue you from himthat would have forced your honour and your lovevouchsafe me for my meed but one fair looka smaller boon than this I cannot begand less than this I am sure you cannot givehow like a dream is this I see and hearlove lend me patience to forbear awhileO miserable unhappy that I amunhappy were you madam ere I camebut by my coming I have made you happyby thy approach thou makest me most unhappyand me when he approacheth to your presencehad I been seized by a hungry lionI would have been a breakfast to the beastrather than have false Proteus rescue meO heaven be judge how I

sayingplease you iull tell you as we pass alongthat you will wonder what hath fortunedcome Proteus itis your penance but to hearthe story of your loves discoveredthat done our day of marriage shall be yoursone feast one house one mutual happinessif you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your SiliaI think this coming summer the king of Silia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes himwherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeedbeseech youverily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we cannot with such magnificence in so rare I know not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insuffience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse usyou pay a great deal too dear for whats given freelybelieve me I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterancesilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their lovesI think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamilhus it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my noteI very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a manwould they else be content to dieyes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to liveif the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had onenine changes of the watery star have beenthe shepherds note since we have left our thronewithout a burden time as long againwould be filled up my brother with our thanksand yet we should for

trusted thee Camillowith all the nearest things to my heart as wellmy chamber-counls wherein priest-like thouhast cleansed my bosom I from thee departedthy penitent reformed but we have beendeceived in thy integrity deceivedin that which seems sobe it forbid my lordto bide uponit thou art not honest orif thou inclinest that way thou art a cowardwhich hoxes honesty behind restrainingfrom course required or else thou must be counteda servant grafted in my serious trustand therein negligent or else a foolthat seest a game played home the rich stake drawnand takest it all for jestmy gracious lordI may be negligent foolish and fearfulin every one of these no man is freebut that his negligence his folly fearamong the infinite doings of the worldsometime puts forth in your affairs my lordif ever I were wilful-negligentit was my folly if industriouslyI played the fool it was my negligencenot weighing well the end if ever fearfulto do a thing where I the issue doubtedwhereof the execution did cry outagainst the non-performance itwas a fearwhich oft infects the wisest these my lordare such allowed infirmities that honestyis never free of but beseech your gracebe plainer with me let me know my trespassby its own visage if I then deny ititis none of mineha not you seen Camillobut thats past doubt you have or your eyeglassis thicker than a cuckolds horn or heardfor to a vision so apparent rumourcannot be mute or thought for cogitationresides not in that man that does not thinkmy wife is slippery if thou wilt confessor else

not be a stander-by to hearmy sovereign mistress clouded so withoutmy present vengeance taken shrew my heartyou never spoke what did become you lessthan this which to reiterate were sinas deep as that though trueis whispering nothingis leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noseskissing with inside lip stopping the careerof laughter with a sigh a note infallibleof breaking honesty horsing foot on footskulking in corners wishing clocks more swifthours minutes noon midnight and all eyesblind with the pin and web but theirs theirs onlythat would unseen be wicked is this nothingwhy then the world and all thats init is nothingthe covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothingmy wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothingsif this be nothinggood my lord be curedof this diseased opinion and betimesfor itis most dangeroussay it be itis trueno no my lordit is you lie you lieI say thou liest Camillo and I hate theepronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slaveor else a hovering temporizer thatcanst with thine eyes at once see good and evilinclining to them both were my wifes liverinfected as her life she would not livethe running of one glasswho does infect herwhy he

thatwhich should undo more doing ay and thouhis cup-bearer whom I from meaner formhave benched and reared to worship who mayst seeplainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heavenhow I am galled mightst bespice a cupto give mine enemy a lasting winkwhich draught to me were cordialsir my lordI could do this and that with no rash potionbut with a lingering dram that should not

unsettledto appoint myself in this vexation sullythe purity and whiteness of my sheetswhich to preserve is sleep which being spottedis goads thorns nettles tails of waspsgive scandal to the blood ofthe prince my sonwho I do think is mine and love as minewithout ripe moving toit would I do thiscould man so blenchI must believe you sirI do and will fetch off Bohemia foritprovided that when hes removed your highnesswill take again your queen as yours at firsteven for your sons sake and thereby for sealingthe injury of tongues in courts and kingdomsknown and allied to yoursthou dost advise meeven so as I mine own course have set downiull give no blemish to her honour nonemy lordgo then and with a countenance as clearas friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemiaand with

lordI will seem friendly as thou hast advised meO miserable lady but for mewhat case stand I in I must be the poisonerof good Polixenes and my ground to doitis the obedience to a master onewho in rebellion with himself will haveall that are his so too to do this deedpromotion follows if I could find exampleof thousands that had struck anointed kingsand flourished after id not doit but sincenor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not onelet villany itself forsweart I mustforsake the court to doit or no is certainto me a break-neck Happy star reign nowhere comes Bohemiathis is strange methinksmy favour here begins to warp not speakgood day Camillohail most royal sirwhat is the news inthe courtnone rare my lordthe king hath on him such a countenanceas he had lost some province and a regionloved as he loves himself even now I met himwith customary compliment when hewafting his eyes to the contrary and fallinga lip of much contempt speeds from me andso leaves me to consider what is breedingthat changes thus his mannersI dare not know my lordhow dare not do not do you know and dare notbe intelligent to me itis thereaboutsfor to yourself what you do know you mustand cannot say you dare not Good Camilloyour changed complexions are to me a mirrorwhich shows me mine changed too for I must bea party in this alteration findingmyself thus altered

looked on thousands who have sped the betterby my regard but killed none so Camilloas you are certainly a gentleman theretoclerk-like experienced which no less adornsour gentry than our parents noble namesin whose success we are gentle I beseech youif you know aught which does behove my knowledgethereof to be informed imprison it notin ignorant concealmentI may not answera sickness caught of me and yet I wellI must be answered dost thou hear CamilloI conjure thee by all the parts of manwhich honour does acknowledge whereof the leastis not this suit of mine that thou declarewhat indency thou dost guess of harmis creeping toward me how far off how nearwhich way to be prevented if to beif not how best to bear itsir I will tell yousince I am charged in honour and by himthat I think honourable therefore mark my counselwhich must be even as swiftly followed asI mean to utter it or both yourself and mecry lost and so good nighton good CamilloI am appointed him to murder youby whom Camilloby the kingfor whathe thinks nay with all confidence he swearsas he had seent or been an instrumentto vice you toit that you have touched his queenforbiddenlyO then my best blood turnto an infected jelly and my namebe yoked with his that did betray the Bestturn then my freshest reputation toa savour that may strike the dullest nostrilwhere I arrive and my approach be shunnednay hated too worse than the greatest infectionthat eer was heard or readswear his thought overby each particular star in heaven andby all their influences you may as wellforbid the sea for to obey the moonas or by oath remove or counsel shakethe fabric of his folly whose foundationis piled upon his faith and will continuethe standing of his bodyhow should this growI know not but I am sure itis safer toavoid whats grown than question how itis bornif therefore you dare trust my honestythat lies enclosed in this trunk which youshall bear along impawned away to-nightyour followers I will whisper to the businessand will by twos and threes at several posternsclear them ofthe ty for myself iull putmy fortunes to your

thing condemned to lossno iull not rearanothers issueplease your highness postsfrom those you sent to the oracle are comean hour since Cleomenes and Dionbeing well arrived from Delphos are both landedhasting to the courtso please you sir their speedhath been beyond accounttwenty-three daysthey have been absent itis good speed foretellsthe great Apollo suddenly will havethe truth of this appear Prepare you lordssummon a session that we may arraignour most disloyal lady for as she hathbeen publicly accused so shall she havea just and open trial while she livesmy heart will be a burden to me Leave meand think upon my biddingthe climates delicate the air most sweetfertile the isle the temple much surpassingthe common praise it bearsI shall reportfor most it caught me the celestial habitsmethinks I so should term them and the reverenceof the grave wearers O the sacrificehow ceremonious solemn and unearthlyit was inthe offeringbut of all the burstand the ear-deafening voice ofthe oraclekin to Joves thunder so surprised my sensethat I was nothingif the event ofthe journeyprove as successful to the queen O bet soas it hath been to us rare pleasant speedythe time is worth the use onitgreat Apolloturn all to the best these proclamationsso forng faults upon HermioneI little likethe violent carriage of itwill clear or end the business when the oraclethus by Apollos great divine sealed upshall the contents discover something rareeven then will rush to knowledge go fresh horsesand gracious be the issuethis sessions to our great grief we pronounceeven pushes gainst our heart the party triedthe daughter of a king our wife and oneof us too much beloved let us be clearedof being tyrannous since we so openlyproceed in justice which shall have due courseeven to the guilt or the purgationproduce the prisonerit is his highness pleasure that the queenappear in person here in court Silenceread the indictmentHermione queen to the worthy Leontes king of Silia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with Polixenes king of Bohemia and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by rcumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by nightsince what I am to say must be but thatwhich contradicts my accusation andthe testimony on my part no otherbut what comes from myself it shall scarce boot meto say not guilty mine integritybeing counted falsehood shall as I express itbe so received but thus if powers divinebehold our human actions as they doI doubt not then but innocence shall makefalse accusation blush and tyrannytremble at patience you my lord best knowwho least will seem to do so my past lifehath been as continent as chaste as trueas I am now unhappy which is morethan history can pattern though devisedand played to take spectators for behold mea fellow of the royal bed which owea moiety of the throne a great kings daughterthe mother to a hopeful prince here standingto prate and talk for life and honour forewho please to come and hear for life I prize itas I weigh grief which I would spare for honouritis a derivative from me to mineand only that I stand for I appealto your own consence sir before Polixenescame to your court how I was in your gracehow merited to be so since he camewith what encounter so uncurrent Ihave strained to appear thus if one jot beyondthe bound of honour or in act or willthat way inclining hardened be the heartsof all that hear me and my nearest of kincry fie upon my graveI neer heard yetthat any of these bolder vices wantedless impudence to gainsay what they didthan to perform it firstthats true enoughthough itis a saying sir not due to meyou will not own itmore than mistress ofwhich comes to me in name of fault I must notat all acknowledge for Polixeneswith whom I am accused I do confessI loved him as in honour he requiredwith such a kind of love as might becomea lady like me with a love even suchso and no other as yourself commandedwhich not to have done I think had been in meboth disobedience and ingratitudeto you and toward your friend whose love had spokeeven since it could speak from an infant freelythat it was yours now for conspiracyI know not how it tastes though it be dishedfor me to try how all I know of itis that Camillo was an honest manand why he left your court the gods themselveswotting no more than I are ignorantyou knew of his departure as you knowwhat you have undertaen to do ins absencesiryou speak a language that I understand notmy life stands in the level of your dreamswhich iull lay downyour actions are my dreamsyou had a bastard by Polixenesand I but dreamed it as you were past all shamethose of your fact are so so past all truthwhich to deny concerns more than avails for asthy brat hath been cast out like to itselfno father owning it which is indeedmore criminal in thee than it so thoushalt feel our justice in whose easiest passagelook for no less than deathsir spare your threatsthe bug which you would fright me with I seekto me can life be no commoditythe crown and comfort of my life your favourI do give lost for I do feel it gonebut know not how it went my second joyand first-fruits of my body from his presenceI am barred like one infectious my third comfortstarred most unluckily is from my breastthe innocent milk in its most innocent mouthhaled out to murder myself on every postproclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatredthe child-bed privilege denied which longsto women of all fashion lastly hurriedhere to this place inthe open air beforeI have got strength of limit now my liegetell me what blessings I have here alivethat I should fear to die therefore proceedbut yet hear this mistake me not no lifeI prize it not a straw but for mine honourwhich I would free if I shall be condemnedupon surmises all proofs sleeping elsebut what your jealousies awake I tell youitis rigour and not law your honours allI do refer me to the oracleApollo be my judgethis your requestis altogether just therefore bring forthand in Apollos name his oraclethe emperor of Russia was my fatherO that he were alive and here beholdinghis daughters trial that he did but seethe flatness of my misery yet with eyesof pity not revengeyou here shall swear upon this sword of justicethat you Cleomenes and Dion havebeen both at Delphos and from thence have broughtthis sealed-up oracle by the hand deliveredof great Apollos priest and that since thenyou have not dared to break the holy sealnor read the secrets initall this we swearall this we swearbreak up the seals and readHermione is chaste Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not foundnow blessed be the great Apollopraisedhast thou read truthay my lord even soas it is here set downthere is no truth at all inthe oraclethe sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehoodmy lord the king the kingwhat is the businessO sir I shall be hated to report itthe prince your son with mere conceit and fearof the queens speed is gonehow goneis deadApollos angry and the heavens themselvesdo strike at my injusticehow now therethis news is mortal to the queen look downand see what death is doingtake her henceher heart is but oercharged she will recoverI have too much believed mine own suspionbeseech you tenderly apply to hersome remedies for lifeApollo pardonmy great profaneness gainst thine oracleiull reconle me to Polixenesnew woo my queen recall the good Camillowhom I proclaim a man of truth of mercyfor being transported by my jealousiesto bloody thoughts and to revenge I choseCamillo for the minister to poisonmy friend Polixenes which had been donebut that the good mind of Camillo tardiedmy swift command though I with death and withreward did threaten and encourage himnot doing it and being done he most humaneand filled with honour to my kingly guestunclasped my practice quit his fortunes herewhich you knew great and to the certain hazardof all incertainties himself commendedno richer than his honour how he glistersthorough my rust and how his pietydoes my deeds make the blackerwoe the whileO cut my lace lest my heart cracking itbreak toowhat fit is this good ladywhat studied torments tyrant hast for mewhat wheels racks fires what flaying or what boilingin leads or oils what old or newer torturemust I receive whose every word deservesto taste of thy most worst thy tyrannytogether working with thy jealousiesfanes too weak for boys too green and idlefor girls of nine O think what they have doneand then run mad indeed stark mad for allthy by-gone fooleries were but spices of itthat thou betrayedst Polixenes itwas nothingthat did but show thee of a fool inconstantand damnable ingrateful nor wast muchthou wouldst have poisoned good Camillos honourto have him kill a king poor trespassesmore monstrous standing by whereof I reckonthe casting forth to crows thy baby daughterto be or none or little though a devilwould have shed water out of fire ere donetnor isit directly laid to thee the deathof the young prince whose honourable thoughtsthoughts high for one so tender cleft the heartthat could conceive a gross and foolish sireblemished his gracious dam this is not nolaid to thy answer but the last O lordswhen I have said cry woe the queen the queenthe sweetest dearest creatures dead and vengeance foritnot dropped down yetthe higher powers forbidI say shes dead iull sweart if word nor oathprevail not go and see if you can bringtincture or lustre in her lip her eyeheat outwardly or breath within iull serve youas I would do the gods but O thou tyrantdo not repent these things for they are heavierthan all thy woes can stir therefore betake theeto nothing but despair a thousand kneesten thousand years together naked fastingupon a barren mountain and still winterin storm perpetual could not move the godsto look that way thou wertgo on go onthou canst not speak too much I have deservedall tongues to talk their bitterestsay no morehoweer the business goes you have made faultinthe boldness of your speechI am sorry foritall faults I make when I shall come to know themI do repent Alas I have showed too muchthe rashness of a woman he is touchedto the noble heart whats gone and whats past helpshould be past grief do not receive afflictionat my petition I beseech you ratherlet me be punished that have minded youof what you should forget now good my liegesir royal sir forgive a foolish womanthe love I bore your queen lo fool againiull speak of her no more nor of your childreniull not remember you of my own lordwho is lost too take your patience to youand iull say nothingthou didst speak but wellwhen most the truth which I receive much betterthan to be pitied of thee Prithee bring meto the dead bodies of my queen and sonone grave shall be for both upon them shallthe causes of their death appear untoour shame perpetual Once a day iull visitthe chapel where they lie and tears shed thereshall be my recreation so long as naturewill bear up with this exerse so longI daily vow to use it come and lead meunto these sorrowsthou art perfect then our ship hath touched uponthe desarts of Bohemiaay my lord and fearwe have landed in ill time the skies look grimlyand threaten present blusters in my consencethe heavens with that we have in hand are angryand frown uponstheir sacred wills be done go get aboardlook

uponitgo thou awayiull follow instantlyI am glad at heartto be so rid of the businesscome poor babeI have heard but not believed the spirits ofthe deadmay walk again if such thing be thy motherappeared to me last night for neer was dreamso like a waking to me comes a creaturesometimes her head on one side some anotherI never saw a vessel of like sorrowso filled and so becoming in pure white robeslike very sanctity she did approachmy cabin where I lay thrice bowed before meand gasping to begin some speech her eyesbecame two spouts the fury spent anondid this break from her Good Antigonussince fate against thy better dispositionhath made thy person for the thrower-outof my poor babe according to thine oathplaces remote enough are in Bohemiathere weep and leave it crying and for the babeis counted lost for ever PerditaI prithee callt for this ungentle businessput on thee by my lord thou neer shalt seethy wife Paulina more and so with shrieksshe melted into air Affrighted muchI did in time collect myself and thoughtthis was so and no slumber Dreams are toysyet for this once yea superstitiouslyI will be squared by this I do believeHermione hath suffered death and thatApollo would this being indeed the issueof king Polixenes it should here be laideither for life or death upon the earthof its right father Blossom speed thee wellthere lie and there thy character there thesewhich may if fortune please both breed thee prettyand still rest thine the storm begins poor wretchthat for thy mothers fault art thus exposedto loss and what

thrust a cork into a hogshead and then for the land-service to see how the bear tore out his shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus a nobleman but to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap-dragoned it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or

sixteen years and leave the growth untriedof that wide gap since it is in my powerto oerthrow law and in one self-born hourto plant and oerwhelm custom let me passthe same I am ere anentest order wasor what is now received I witness tothe times that brought them in so shall I doto the freshest things now reigning and make stalethe glistering of this present as my talenow seems to it your patience this allowingI turn my glass and give my scene such growingas you had slept between Leontes leavingthe effects of his fond jealousies so grievingthat he shuts up himself imagine megentle spectators that I now may bein fair Bohemia and remember wellI mentioned a son ofthe kings which FlorizelI now name to you and with speed so paceto speak of Perdita now grown in graceequal with wondering what of her ensuesI list not prophesy but let Times newsbe known when itis brought forth a shepherds daughterand what to her adheres which follows afteris th argument of Time of this allowif ever you have spent time worse ere nowif never yet that Time himself doth sayhe wishes earnestly you never mayI pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate itis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant thisit is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I oerween to think so which is another spur to my departureas thou lovest me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can suffiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered as too much I cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships of that fatal country Silia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou callest him and reconled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when sawest thou the prince Florizel my son kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtuessir it is three days since I saw the prince what his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exerses than formerly he hath appearedI have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estateI have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottagethats likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of SiliaI willingly obey your commandmy best Camillo we must disguise ourselveswhen daffodils begin to peerwith heigh the doxy over the dalewhy then comes in the sweet ofthe yearfor the red blood reigns in the winters palethe white sheet bleaching on the hedgewith heigh the sweet birds O how they singdoth set my pugging tooth on edgefor a quart of ale is a dish for a kingthe lark that tirra-lirra chantswith heigh with heigh the thrush and the jayare summer songs for me and my auntswhile we lie tumbling in the hayI have served prince Florizel and in my time wore three-pile but now I am out of

my account I well may giveand in the stocks avouch itmy traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen my father named me Autolycus who being as I am littered under Mercury was likewise

them means and bases but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to hornpipes I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates none thats out of my note nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that I may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins ofthe sunO that ever I was borninthe name of meO help me help me pluck but off these rags and then death deathalack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these offO sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millionsalas poor man a million of beating may come to a great matterI am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel taen from me and these detestable things put upon mewhat by a horseman or a footmana footman sweet sir

tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the courthis vices you would say theres no virtue whipped out of the court they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abidevices I would say sir I know this man well he hath been since an ape-bearer then a process-server a bailiff then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinkers wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue some call him Autolycusout upon him Prig for my life prig he haunts

folly and the feedersdigest it with a custom I should blushto see you so attired swoon I thinkto show myself a glassI bless the timewhen my good falcon made her flight acrossthy fathers groundnow Jove afford you causeto me the difference forges dread your greatnesshath not been used to fear even now I trembleto think your father by some acdentshould pass this way as you did O the fateshow would he look to see his work so noblevilely bound up what would he say Or howshould I in these my borrowed flaunts beholdthe sternness of his presenceapprehendnothing but jollity the gods themselveshumbling their deities to love have takenthe shapes of beasts upon them Jupiterbecame a bull and bellowed the green Neptunea ram and bleated and the fire-robed godgolden Apollo a poor humble swainas I seem now Their transformationswere never for a piece of beauty rarernor in a way so chaste since my desiresrun not before mine honour nor my lustsburn hotter than my faithO but siryour resolution cannot hold when itisopposed as it must be by the power of the kingone of these two must be necessitieswhich then will speak that you must change this purposeor I

themfor I have heard it saidthere is an art which in their piedness shareswith great creating naturesay there beyet nature is made better by no meanbut nature makes that mean so over that

daughterI think so too for never gazed the moonupon the water as hell stand and readas itwere my daughters eyes and to be plainI think there is not half a kiss to choosewho loves another bestshe dances featlyso she does any thing though I report itthat should be silent if young Doriclesdo light upon her she shall bring him thatwhich he not dreams ofO master if you did but hear the pedlar

ears grew to his tuneshe could never come better he shall come in I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentablyhe hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he has the prettiest love-songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burthens of

man puts him off slights him with whoop do me no harm good man this is a brave fellowbelieve me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow Has he any unbraided wareshe hath ribands of all the colours inthe rainbow points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by the gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were a she-angel he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square onitprithee bring him in and let him approach singingforewarn him that he use no scurrilous words ins tunesyou have of these pedlars that have more in them than youed think sisteray good brother or go about to thinklawn as white as driven snowcyprus black as eer was

sceptres heirthat thus affectest a sheep-hook thou old traitorI am sorry that by hanging thee I canbut shorten thy life one week and thou fresh pieceof excellent witchcraft who of force must knowthe royal fool thou copest withO my heartiull have thy beauty scratched with briers and mademore homely than thy state for thee fond boyif I may ever know thou dost but sighthat thou no more shalt see this knack as neverI mean thou shalt well bar thee from successionnot hold thee of our blood no not our kinfar than Deucalion off mark thou my wordsfollow us to the court thou churl for this timethough full of our displeasure yet we free theefrom the dead blow of it and you enchantmentworthy enough a herdsman yea him toothat makes himself but for our honour thereinunworthy thee if ever henceforth thouthese rural latches to his entrance openor hoop his body more with thy embracesI will devise a death as cruel for theeas thou art tender toiteven here undoneI was not much afeard for once or twiceI was about to speak and tell him plainlythe self-same sun that shines upon his courthides not his visage from our cottage butlooks on alike willit please you sir be goneI told you what would come of this beseech youof your own state take care this dream of minebeing now awake iull queen it no inch furtherbut milk my ewes and weepwhy how now fatherspeak ere thou diestI cannot speak nor thinknor dare to know that which I know O siryou have undone a man of fourscore threethat thought to fill his grave in quiet yeato die upon the bed my father diedto lie close by his honest bones but nowsome hangman must put on my shroud and lay mewhere no priest shovels in dust O cursed wretchthat knewest this was the prince and wouldst adventureto mingle faith with him undoneif I might die within this hour I have livedto die when I desirewhy look you so upon meI am but sorry not afeard delayedbut nothing altered what I was I ammore straining on for plucking back not followingmy leash unwillinglygracious my lordyou know your fathers temper at this timehe will allow no speech which I do guessyou do not purpose to him and as hardlywill he endure your sight as yet I fearthen till the fury of his highness settlecome not before himI not purpose itI think Camilloeven he my lordhow often have I told you twould be thushow often said my dignity would lastbut till itwere knownit cannot fail but bythe violation of my faith and thenlet nature crush the sides ofthe earth togetherand mar the seeds within Lift up thy looksfrom my succession wipe me father Iam heir to my affectionbe advisedI am and by my fancy if my reasonwill thereto be obedient I have reasonif not my senses better pleased with madnessdo bid it welcomethis is desperate sirso call it but it does fulfil my vowI needs must think it honesty Camillonot for Bohemia nor the pomp that maybe thereat gleaned for all the sun sees orthe close earth wombs or the profound sea hidesin unknown fathoms will I break my oathto this my fair beloved therefore I pray youas you have ever been my fathers honoured friendwhen he shall miss me as in faith I mean notto see him any more cast your good counselsupon his passion let myself and fortunetug for the time to come this you may knowand so deliver I am put to seawith her whom here I cannot hold on shoreand most opportune to our need I havea vessel rides fast by but not preparedfor this design what course I mean to holdshall nothing benefit your knowledge norconcern me the reportingO my lordI would your spirit were easier for adviceor stronger for your needhark Perditaiull hear you by and byhes irremovableresolved for flight now were I happy ifhis going I could frame to serve my turnsave him from danger do him love and honourpurchase the sight again of dear Siliaand that unhappy king my master whomI so much thirst to seenow good CamilloI am so fraught with curious business thatI leave out ceremonysir I thinkyou have heard of my poor services inthe lovethat I have borne your fathervery noblyhave you deserved it is my fathers musicto speak your deeds not little of his careto have them recompensed as thought onwell my lordif you may please to think I love the kingand through him whats nearest to him which isyour gracious self embrace but my directionif your more ponderous and settled projectmay suffer alteration on mine honouriull point you where you shall have such receivingas shall become your highness where you mayenjoy your mistress from the whom I seetheres no disjunction to be made but byas heavens forfend your ruin marry herand with my best endeavours in your absenceyour discontenting father strive to qualifyand bring him up to likinghow Camillomay this almost a miracle be donethat I may call thee something more than manand after that trust to theehave you thought ona place whereto youll gonot any yetbut as the unthought-on acdent is guiltyto what we wildly do so we professourselves to be the slaves of chance and fliesof every wind that blowsthen list to methis follows if you will not change your purposebut undergo this flight make for Siliaand there present yourself and your fair princessfor so I see she must be fore Leontesshe shall be habited as it becomesthe partner of your bed Methinks I seeleontes opening his free arms and weepinghis welcomes forth asks thee the son forgivenessas itwere inthe fathers person kisses the handsof your fresh princess oer and oer divides himbtwixt his unkindness and his kindness the onehe chides to hell and bids the other growfaster than thought or timeworthy Camillowhat colour for my visitation shall Ihold up before himsent by the king your fatherto greet him and to give him comforts Sirthe manner of your bearing towards him withwhat you as from your father shall deliverthings known betwixt us three iull write you downthe which shall point you forth at every sittingwhat you must say that he shall not perceivebut that you have your fathers bosom thereand speak his very heartI am bound to youthere is some sap in thisa course more promisingthan a wild dedication of yourselvesto unpathed waters undreamed shores most certainto miseries enough no hope to help youbut as you shake off one to take anothernothing so certain as your anchors whodo their best office if they can but stay youwhere youll be loath to be besides you knowprosperitys the very bond of lovewhose fresh complexion and whose heart togetheraffliction altersone of these is trueI think affliction may subdue the cheekbut not take in the mindyea say you sothere shall not at your fathers house these seven yearsbe born another suchmy good Camilloshe is as forward of her breeding asshe is inthe rear o her birthI cannot say itis pityshe lacks instructions for she seems a mistressto most that teachyour pardon sir for thisiull blush you thanksmy prettiest Perditabut O the thorns we stand upon Camillopreserver of my father now of methe medne of our house how shall we dowe are not furnished like Bohemias sonnor shall appear in Silia my lordfear none of this I think you know my fortunesdo all lie there it shall be so my careto have you royally appointed as ifthe scene you

counterfeit stone not a ribandglass pomander brooch table-book balladknife tape glove shoe-tie bracelet horn-ring tokeep my pack from fasting they throng who shouldbuy first as if my trinkets had been hallowedand brought a benediction to the buyerby which means I saw whose purse was best inpicture and what I saw to my good useI remembered my clown who wants but somethingto be a reasonable man grew soin love with the wenches song that hewould not stir his pettitoes till he hadboth tune and words which so drew the rest ofthe herd to me that all their other sensesstuck in ears you might have pinched a placketit was senseless itwas nothing to geld acodpiece of a purse I would have filed keysoff that hung in chains no hearing no feelingbut my sirs song and admiring thenothing of it so that in this time oflethargy I picked and cut most of theirfestival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the kings son and scared my choughs from the chaff I had not left a purse alive in the whole armynay but my letters by this means being thereso soon as you arrive shall clear that doubtand those that youll procure from king Leontesshall satisfy your father Happy be youall that you speak shows fair whom have we herewell make an instrument of this omitnothing may give us aidif they have overheard me now why

Perdita what have we twain forgotpray you a wordwhat I do next shall be to tell the kingof this escape and whither they are boundwherein my hope is I shall so prevailto force him after in whose companyI shall review Silia for whose sightI have a womans longingfortune speed usthus we set on Camillo to the sea-sidethe swifter speed the betterI understand the business I hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut-purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal I would not doit I hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession Aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lanes end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man worksee see what a man you are now there is no other way but to tell the king shes a changeling and none of your flesh and bloodnay but hear menay but hear mego to thenshe being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him Show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle I warrant youI will tell the king all every word yea and his sons pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the kings brother-in-lawindeed brother-in-law was the furthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know not how much an ouncevery wisely puppieswell let us to the king there is that in this fardel will

know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to the speech of himage thou hast lost thy labourwhy sirthe king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of griefso itis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherds daughterif that shepherd be not now in hand-fast let him fly the curses he shall have the torture he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monsterthink you so sirnot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary An old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace Some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say I draw our throne into a sheep cote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easyhas the old man eer a son sir do you hear ant like you sirhe has a son who shall be flayed alive then nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasps nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua-vitor some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick-wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital Tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king being something gently considered iull bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is a man shall do ithe seems to be of great authority close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear

may say even blessedlets before as he bids us he was provided to do us goodif I had a mind to be honest I see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth I am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement I will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far offious for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs toit to him will I present them there may be matter in itsir you have done enough and have performeda saint-like sorrow no fault could you makewhich you have not redeemed indeed paid downmore penitence than done trespass At the lastdo as the heavens have done forget your evilwith them forgive yourselfwhilst I rememberher and her virtues I cannot forgetmy blemishes in them and so still think ofthe wrong I did myself which was so muchthat heirless it hath made my kingdom anddestroyed the sweetest companion that eer manbred his hopes out oftrue too true my lordif one by one you wedded all the worldor from the all that are took something goodto make a perfect woman she you killedwould be unparalleledI think so Killedshe I killed I did so but thou strikest mesorely to say I did it is as bitterupon thy tongue as in my thought now good nowsay so but seldomnot at all good ladyyou might have spoken a thousand things that wouldhave done the time more benefit and gracedyour kindness betteryou are one of thosewould have him wed againif you would not soyou pity not the state nor the remembranceof his most sovereign name consider littlewhat dangers by his highness fail of issuemay drop upon his kingdom and devourincertain lookers-on what were more holythan to rejoice the former queen is wellwhat holier than for royaltys repairfor present comfort and for future goodto bless the bed of majesty againwith a sweet fellow toitthere is none worthyrespecting her thats gone besides the godswill have fulfilled their secret purposesfor has not the divine Apollo saidisit not the tenour of his oraclethat king Leontes shall not have an heirtill his lost child be found which that it shallis all as monstrous to our human reasonas my Antigonus to break his graveand come again to me who on my lifedid perish with the infant itis your counselmy lord should to the heavens be contraryoppose against their willscare not for issuethe crown will find an heir great Alexanderleft his to the worthiest so his successorwas like to be the bestgood Paulinawho hast the memory of HermioneI know in honour O that ever Ihad squared me to thy counsel then even nowI might have looked upon my queens full eyeshave taken treasure from her lipsand left themmore rich for what they yieldedthou speakest truthno more such wives therefore no wife one worseand better used would make her sainted spiritagain possess her corpse and on this stagewhere were offenders now appear soul-vexedand begin why to me had she such powershe had just causeshe had and would incense meto murder her I marriedI should sowere I the ghost that walked id bid you markher eye and tell me for what dull part inityou chose her then id shriek that even your earsshould rift to hear me and the words that followedshould be Remember mine stars starsand all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wifeiull have no wife Paulinawill you swearnever to marry but by my free leavenever Paulina so be blessed my spiritthen good my lords bear witness to his oathyou tempt him over muchunless anotheras like Hermione as is her pictureaffront his eyegood

piece of earth I thinkthat eer the sun shone bright onO Hermioneas every present time doth boast itselfabove a better gone so must thy gravegive way to whats seen now sir you yourselfhave said

betterpardon madamthe one I have almost forgot your pardonthe other when she has obtained your eyewill have your tongue too this is a creaturewould she begin a sect might quench the zealof all professors else make proselytesof who she but bid followhow not womenwomen will love her that she is a womanmore worth than any man men that she isthe rarest of all womengo Cleomenesyourself assisted with your honoured friendsbring them to our embracement Still itis strangehe thus should steal upon ushad our princejewel of children seen this hour he had pairedwell with this lord there was not full a monthbetween their birthsprithee no more cease thou knowesthe dies to me again when talked of surewhen I shall see this gentleman thy speecheswill bring me to consider that which mayunfurnish me of reason they are comeyour mother was most true to wedlock princefor she did print your royal father offconceiving you were I but twenty-oneyour fathers image is so hit in youhis very air that I should call you brotheras I did him and speak of something wildlyby us performed before most dearly welcomeand you fair princess goddess O alasI lost a couple that btwixt heaven and earthmight thus have stood begetting wonder asyou gracious couple do and then I lostall mine own folly the societyamity too of your brave father whomthough bearing misery I desire my lifeonce more to look on himby his commandhave I here touched Silia and from himgive you all greetings that a king at friendcan send his brother and but infirmitywhich waits upon worn times hath something seizedhis wished ability he had himselfthe land and waters btwixt your throne and hismeasured to look upon you whom he loveshe bade me say so more than all the sceptresand those that bear them livingO my brothergood gentleman the wrongs I have done thee stirafresh within me and these thy officesso rarely kind are as interpretersof my behind-hand slackness welcome hitheras is the spring to the earth and hath he tooexposed this paragon to the fearful usageat least ungentle of the dreadful Neptuneto greet a man not worth her pains much lessthe adventure of her persongood my lordshe came from Libyawhere the war-like Smalusthat noble honoured lord is feared and lovedmost royal sir from thence from him whose daughterhis tears proclaimed his parting with her thencea prosperous south-wind friendly we have crossedto execute the charge my father gave mefor visiting your highness my best trainI have from your Silian shores dismissedwho for Bohemia bend to signifynot only my success in Libya sirbut my arrival and my wifes in safetyhere where we arethe blessed godspurge all infection from our air whilst youdo climate here you have a holy fathera graceful gentleman against whose personso sacred as it is I have done sinfor which the heavens taking angry notehave left me issueless and your fathers blessedas he from heaven merits it with youworthy his goodness what might I have beenmight I a son and daughter now have looked onsuch goodly things as youmost noble sirthat which I shall report will bear no creditwere not the proof so nigh please you great sirBohemia greets you from himself by medesires you to attach his son who hashis dignity and duty both cast offfled from his father from his hopes and witha shepherds daughterwheres Bohemia speakhere in your ty I now came from himI speak amazedly and it becomesmy marvel and my message to your courtwhiles he was hastening in the chase it seemsof this fair couple meets he on the waythe father of this seeming lady andher brother having both their country quittedwith this young princeCamillo has betrayed mewhose honour and whose honesty till nowendured all weatherslayt so to his chargehes with the king your fatherwho CamilloCamillo sir I spake with him who nowhas these poor men in question never saw Iwretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earthforswear themselves as often as they speakBohemia stops his ears and threatens themwith divers deaths in deathO my poor fatherthe heaven sets spies upon us will not haveour contract celebratedyou are marriedwe are not sir nor are we like to bethe stars I see will kiss the valleys firstthe odds for high and lows alikemy lordis this the daughter of a kingshe iswhen once she is my wifethat once I see by your good fathers speedwill come on very slowly I am sorrymost sorry you have broken from his likingwhere you were tied in duty and as sorryyour choice is not so rich in worth as beautythat you might well enjoy herdear look upthough fortune visible an enemyshould chase us with my father power no jothath she to change our loves Beseech you sirremember since you owed no more to timethan I do now with thought of such affectionsstep forth mine advocate at your requestmy father will grant precious things as trifleswould he do so id beg your precious mistresswhich he counts but a triflesir my liegeyour eye hath too much youth init not a monthfore your queen died she was more worth such gazesthan what you look on nowI thought of hereven in these looks I madebut your petitionis yet unanswered I will to your fatheryour honour not oerthrown by your desiresI am friend to them and you upon which errandI now go toward him therefore follow meand mark what way I make come good my lordbeseech you sir were you present at this relationI was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the childI would most gladly know the issue of itI make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs behere comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news Rogeronothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express ithere comes the lady Paulinas steward he can deliver you more how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspion has the king found his heirmost true if ever truth were pregnant by rcumstance that which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen Hermione her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the two kingsnothen have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries O thy mother thy mother then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son-in-law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do itwhat pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the childlike an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knowswhat became of his bark and his followerswracked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but O the noble combat that btwixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embrang as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losingthe dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it actedone of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas I would fain say bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swounded all sorrowed if all the world could have seent the woe had been universalare they returned to the courtno the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of Paulina a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to supI thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoingwho would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge lets alongnow had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea-sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but itis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits here come those I have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortunecome boy I am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen bornyou are well met sir you denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born see you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentleman born give me the lie do and try whether I am not now gentleman bornI know you are now sir a gentleman bornay and have been so any time these four hoursand so have I boyso you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the kings son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shedwe may live son to shed many moreay or else itwere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we areI humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my masterprithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlementhou wilt amend thy lifeay an it like your good worshipgive me thy hand I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemiayou may say it but not swear itnot swear it now I am a gentleman let boors and franklins say it iull swear ithow if it be false sonif it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and iull swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but iull swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy handsI will prove so sir to my poweray by any means prove a tall fellow if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queens picture come follow us well be thy good mastersO grave and good Paulina the great comfortthat I have had of theewhat sovereign sirI did not well I meant well All my servicesyou have paid home but that you have vouchsafedwith your crowned brother and these your contractedheirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visitit is a surplus of your grace which nevermy life may last to answerO Paulinawe honour you with trouble but we cameto see the statue of our queen your galleryhave we passed through not without much contentin many singularities but we saw notthat which my daughter came to look uponthe statue of her motheras she lived peerlessso her dead likeness I do well believeexcels whatever yet you looked uponor hand of man hath done therefore I keep itlonely apart but here it is prepareto see the life as lively mocked as everstill sleep mocked death behold and say itis wellI like your silence it the more shows offyour wonder but yet speak first you my liegecomes it not something nearher natural posturechide me dear stone that I may say indeedthou art Hermione or rather thou art shein thy not chiding for she was as tenderas infancy and grace but yet PaulinaHermione was not so much wrinkled nothingso aged as this seemsO not by muchso much the more our carvers excellencewhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes heras she lived nowas now she might have doneso much to my good comfort as it isnow pierng to my soul O thus she stoodeven with such life of majesty warm lifeas now it coldly stands when first I wooed herI am ashamed does not the stone rebuke mefor being more stone than it O royal piecetheres magic in thy majesty which hasmy evils conjured to remembrance andfrom thy admiring daughter took the spiritsstanding like stone with theeand give me leaveand do not say itis superstition thatI kneel and then implore her blessing Ladydear queen that ended when I but begangive me that hand of yours to kissO patiencethe statue is but newly fixed the coloursnot drymy lord your sorrow was too sore laid onwhich sixteen winters cannot blow awayso many summers dry scarce any joydid ever so long live no sorrowbut killed itself much soonerdear my brotherlet him that was the cause of this have powerto take off so much grief from you as hewill piece up in himselfindeed my lordif I had thought the sight of my poor imagewould thus have wrought you for the stone is mineied not have showed itdo not draw the curtainno longer shall you gaze onit lest your fancymay think anon it moveslet be let bewould I were dead but that methinks alreadywhat was he that did make it See my lordwould you not deem it breathed and that those veinsdid verily bear bloodmasterly donethe very life seems warm upon her lipthe fixure of her eye has motion initas we are mocked with artiull draw the curtainmy lords almost so far transported thathell think anon it livesO sweet Paulinamake me to think so twenty years togetherno settled senses of the world can matchthe pleasure of that madness lett aloneI am sorry sir I have thus far stirred you butI could afflict you furtherdo Paulinafor this affliction has a taste as sweetas any cordial comfort still methinksthere is an air comes from her what fine chiselcould ever yet cut breath let no man mock mefor I will kiss hergood my lord forbearthe ruddiness upon her lip is wetyoull mar it if you kiss it stain your ownwith oily painting shall I draw the curtainno not these twenty yearsso long could Istand by a looker-oneither forbearquit presently the chapel or resolve youfor more amazement if you can behold itiull make the statue move indeed descendand take you by the hand but then youll thinkwhich I protest against I am assistedby wicked powerswhat you can make her doI am content to look on what to speakI am content to hear for itis as easyto make her speak as moveit is requiredyou do awake your faith then all stand stillor those that think it is unlawful businessI am about let them departproceedno foot shall stirmusic awake her strikeitis time descend be stone no more approachstrike all that look upon with marvel comeiull fill your grave up

Perdita is foundyou gods look downand from your sacred vials pour your gracesupon my daughters head Tell me mine ownwhere hast thou been preserved where lived how foundthy fathers court for thou shalt hear that Iknowing by Paulina that the oraclegave hope thou wast in being have preservedmyself to see the issuetheres time enough for thatlest they desire upon this push to troubleyour joys with like relation go togetheryou precious winners all your exultationpartake to every one I an old turtlewill wing me to some withered bough and theremy mate thats never to be found againlament till I am lostO peace Paulinathou shouldst a husband take by my consentas I by thine a wife this is a matchand made betweens by vows thou hast found minebut how is to be questioned for I saw heras I thought dead and have in vain said manya prayer upon her grave iull not seek farfor him I partly know his mind to find theean honourable husband come Camilloand take her by the hand whose worth and honestyis richly noted and here justifiedby us a pair of kings lets from this placewhat look upon my brother both your pardonsthat eer I put between your holy looksmy ill suspion this your son-in-lawand son unto the king whom heavens directingis troth-plight to your daughter Good Paulinalead us from hence where we may leisurelyeach one demand and answer to his partperformed in this wide gap of time since firstwe were dissevered hastily lead awaytroilus and Cressidain Troy there lies the scene From isles of Greecethe princes orgulous their high blood chafedhave to the port of Athens sent their shipsfraught with the ministers and instrumentsof cruel war sixty and nine that woretheir crownets regal from the Athenian bayput forth toward Phrygia and their vow is madeto ransack Troy within whose strong immuresthe ravished Helen Menelaus queenwith wanton Paris sleeps and thats the quarrelto Tenedos they comeand the deep-drawing barks do there disgorgetheir war-like fraughtage now on Dardan plainsthe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitchtheir brave pavilions Priams six-gated tydardan and Tymbria Ilias Chetas Trojanand Antenorides with massy staplesand corresponsive and fulfilling boltssperr up the sons of Troynow expectation tickling skittish spiritson one and other side Trojan and Greeksets all on hazard and hither am I comea prologue armed but not in confidenceof authors pen or actors voice but suitedin like conditions as our argumentto tell you fair beholders that our playleaps oer the vaunt and firstlings of those broilsbeginning in the middle starting thence awayto what may be digested in a playlike or find fault do as your pleasures arenow good or bad itis but the chance of warcall here my varlet iull unarm againwhy should I war without the walls of Troythat find such cruel battle here withineach Trojan that is master of his heartlet him to field Troilus alas has nonewill this gear neer be mendedthe Greeks are strong and skilful to their strengthfierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiantbut I am weaker than a womans teartamer than sleep fonder than ignoranceless valiant than the virgin in the nightand skilless as unpractised infancywell I have told you enough of this for my part iull not meddle nor make no further he that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grindinghave I not tarrieday the grinding but you must tarry the boltinghave I not tarrieday the bolting but you must tarry the leaveningstill have I tarrieday to the leavening but heres yet in the word hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lipspatience herself what goddess eer she bedoth lesser blench at sufferance than I doat Priams royal table do I sitand when fair Cressid comes into my thoughtsso traitor when she comes when is she thencewell she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look or any woman elseI was about to tell thee when my heartas wedged with a sigh would rive in twainlest Hector or my father should perceive meI

Ilium and where she resideslet it be called the wild and wandering floodourself the merchant and this sailing Pandarour doubtful hope our convoy and our barkhow now prince Troilus wherefore not afieldbecause not there this womans answer sortsfor womanish it is to be from thencewhat news neas from the field to-daythat Paris is returned home and hurtby whom neastroilus by Menelauslet Paris bleed itis but a scar to scornparis is gored with Menelaus hornhark what good sport is out of town to-daybetter at home if would I might were may but to the sport abroad are you bound thitherin all swift hastecome go we then togetherwho were those went byqueen Hecuba and Helenand whither go theyup to the eastern towerwhose height commands as subject all the valeto see the battle Hector whose patienceis as a virtue fixed to-day was movedhe chid Andromache and struck his armourerand like as there were husbandry in warbefore the sun rose he was harnessed lightand to the field goes he where every flowerdid as a prophet weep what it foresawin Hectors wrathwhat was his cause of angerthe noise goes this there is among the Greeksa lord of Trojan blood nephew to Hectorthey call him Ajaxgood and what of himthey say he is a very man per seand stands aloneso do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legsthis man lady hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sightbut how should this man that makes me smile make Hector angrythey say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and wakingwho comes heremadam your uncle Pandarushectors a gallant manas may be in the world ladywhats that whats thatgood morrow uncle Pandarusgood morrow cousin Cressid what do you talk of Good morrow Alexanderhow do you cousin when were you at Iliumthis morning unclewhat were you talking of when I came was Hector armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium Helen was not up was shehector was gone but Helen was not upeen so Hector was stirring earlythat were we talking of and of his angerwas he angryso he says heretrue he was so I know the cause too hell lay about him to-day I can tell them that and theres Troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of Troilus I can tell them that toowhat is he angry toowho Troilus Troilus is the better man of the twoO Jupiter theres no comparisonwhat not between Troilus and Hectordo you know a man if you see himay if I ever saw him before and knew himwell I say Troilus is Troilusthen you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hectorno nor Hector is not Troilus in some degreesitis just to each of them he is himselfhimself Alas poor Troilus I would he wereso he iscondition I had gone bare-foot to Indiahe is not Hectorhimself no hes not himself would a were himself well the gods are above time must friend or end well Troilus well I would my heart were in her body no Hector is not a better man than Troilusexcuse mehe is elderpardon me pardon meth others not come toit you shall tell me another tale when the others come toit Hector shall not have his wit this yearhe shall not need it if he have his ownnor his qualitiesno matternor his beautytwould not become him his owns betteryou have no judgment niece Helen herself swore th other day that Troilus for a brown favour for so itis I must confess not brown neitherno but brownfaith to say truth brown and not brownto say the truth true and not trueshe praised his complexion above Pariswhy Paris hath colour enoughso he hasthen Troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helens golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper noseI swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paristhen shes a merry Greek indeednay I am sure she does she came to him th other day into the compassed window and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chinindeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a totalwhy he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hectoris he so young a man and so old a lifterbut to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chinjuno have mercy how came it clovenwhy you know itis dimpled I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all PhrygiaO he smiles valiantlydoes he notO yes an itwere a cloud in autumnwhy go to then but to prove to you that Helen loves Troilustroilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it sotroilus why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle eggif you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens inthe shellI cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin indeed she has a marvells white hand I must needs confesswithout the rackand she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chinalas poor chin many a wart is richerbut there was such laughing queen Hecuba laughed that her eyes ran oerwith millstonesand Cassandra laughedbut there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run oer tooand Hector laughedat what was all this laughingmarry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus chinant had been a green hair I should have laughed toothey laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answerwhat was his answerquoth she heres but one-and-fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white this is her questionthats true make no question of that one-and-fifty hairs quoth he and one white that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons Jupiter quoth she which of these hairs is Paris my husband the forked one quoth he pluckt out and give it him but there was such laughing and Helen so blushed and Paris so chafed and all the rest so laughed that it passedso let it now for it has been a great while going bywell cousin I told you a thing yesterday think onitso I doiull be sworn itis true he will weep you an itwere a man born in Apriland iull spring up in his tears an itwere a nettle against

be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greecethere is among the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilusachilles a drayman a porter a very camelwell wellwell well why have you any discretion have you any eyes do you know what a man is is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and so forth the spice and salt that season a manay

wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards I lie at a thousand watchessay one of your watchesnay iull watch you for that and thats one of the chiefest of them too if I cannot ward what I would not have hit I can watch you for telling how I took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then its past watchingyou are such anothersir my lord would instantly speak with youwhereat your own house there he unarms himgood boy tell him I comeI doubt he be hurt fare ye well good nieceadieu uncleiull be with you niece by and byto bring uncleay a token from Troilusby the same token you are a bawdwords vows gifts tears and loves full sacrificehe offers in anothers enterprisebut more in Troilus thousand-fold I seethan in the glass of Pandars praise may beyet hold I off Women are angels wooingthings won are done joys soul lies in the doingthat she beloved knows nought that knows not thismen prize the thing ungained more than it isthat she was never yet that ever knewlove got so sweet as when desire did suetherefore this maxim out of love I teachachievement is command ungained beseechthen though my hearts content firm love doth bearnothing of that shall from mine eyes appearprinceswhat grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeksthe ample proposition that hope makesin all designs begun on earth belowfails in the promised largeness checks and disastersgrow in the veins of actions highest rearedas knots by the conflux of meeting sapinfect the sound pine and divert his graintortive and errant from his course of growthnor princes is it matter new to usthat we come short of our suppose so farthat after seven years siege yet Troy walls standsith every action that hath gone beforewhereof we have record trial did drawbias and thwart not answering the aimand that unbodied figure of the thoughtthat gavet surmised shape why then you princesdo you with cheeks abashed behold our worksand call them shames which are indeed nought elsebut the protractive trials of great Joveto find persistive constancy in menthe fineness of which metal is not foundin fortunes love for then the bold and cowardthe wise and fool the artist and unreadthe hard and soft seem all affined and kinbut in the wind and tempest of her frowndistinction with a broad and powerful fanpuffing at all winnows the light awayand what hath mass or matter by itselflies rich in virtue and unmingledwith due observance of thy god-like seatgreat Agamemnon Nestor shall applythy latest words in the reproof of chancelies the true proof of men the sea being smoothhow many shallow bauble boats dare sailupon her patient breast making their waywith those of nobler bulkbut let the ruffian Boreas once enragethe gentle Thetis and anon beholdthe strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cutbounding between the two moist elementslike Perseus horse wheres then the saucy boatwhose weak untimbered sides but even nowco-rivalled greatness either to harbour fledor made a toast for Neptune even sodoth valours show and valours worth dividein storms of fortune for in her ray and brightnessthe herd hath more annoyance by the breesethan by the tiger but when the splitting windmakes flexible the knees of knotted oaksand flies fled under shade why then the thing of courageas roused with rage with rage doth sympathizeand with an accent tuned in self-same keyretorts to chiding fortuneagamemnonthou great commander nerve and bone of Greeceheart of our numbers soul and only spiritin whom the tempers and the minds of allshould be shut up hear what Ulysses speaksbesides the applause and approbationthe whichmost mighty for thy place and swayand thou most reverend for thy stretched-out lifeI give to both your speeches which were suchas Agamemnon and the hand of Greeceshould hold up high in brass and such againas venerable Nestor hatched in silvershould with a bond of air strong as the axle-treeon which heaven rides knit all the Greekish earsto his experienced tongue yet let it please hoththou great and wise to hear Ulysses speakspeak prince of Ithaca and bet of less expectthat matter needless of importless burdendivide thy lips than we are confidentwhen rank Thersites opes his mastick jawswe shall hear music wit and oracletroy yet upon his basis had been downand the great Hectors sword had lacked a masterbut for these instancesthe spealty of rule hath been neglectedand look how many Grean tents do standhollow upon this plain so many hollow factionswhen that the general is not like the hiveto whom the foragers shall all repairwhat honey is expected Degree being vizardedthe unworthiest shows as fairly in the maskthe heavens themselves the planets and this centreobserve degree priority and placeinsisture course proportion season formoffice and custom in all line of orderand therefore is the glorious planet Solin noble eminence enthroned and spheredamidst the other whose mednable eyecorrects the ill aspects of planets eviland posts like the commandment of a kingsans check to good and bad but when the planetsin evil mixture to disorder wanderwhat plagues and what portents what mutinywhat raging of the sea shaking of earthcommotion in the winds frights changes horrorsdivert and crack rend and deranatethe unity and married calm of statesquite from their fixure O when degree is shakedwhich is the ladder to all high designsthe enterprise is sick how could communitiesdegrees in schools and brotherhoods in tiespeaceful commerce from dividable shoresthe primogenitive and due of birthprerogative of age crowns sceptres laurelsbut by degree stand in authentic placetake but degree away untune that stringand hark what discord follows each thing meetsin mere oppugnancy the bounded watersshould lift their bosoms higher than the shoresand make a sop of all this solid globestrength should be lord of imbelityand the rude son should strike his father deadforce should be right or rather right and wrongbetween whose endless jar justice residesshould lose their names and so should justice toothen every thing includes itself in powerpower into will will into appetiteand appetite a universal wolfso doubly seconded with will and powermust make perforce a universal preyand last eat up himself great Agamemnonthis chaos when degree is suffocatefollows the chokingand this neglection of degree it isthat by a pace goes backward with a purposeit hath to climb the generals disdainedby him one step below he by the nextthat next by him beneath so every stepexampled by the first pace that is sickof his superior grows to an envious feverof pale and bloodless emulationand itis this fever that keeps Troy on footnot her own sinews to end a tale of lengthtroy in our weakness lives not in her strengthmost wisely hath Ulysses here discoveredthe fever whereof all our power is sickthe nature of the sickness found Ulysseswhat is the remedythe great Achilles whom opinion crownsthe sinew and the forehand of our hosthaving his ear full of his airy famegrows dainty of his worth and in his tentlies mocking our designs With him Patroclusupon a lazy bed the livelong daybreaks scurril jestsand with ridiculous and awkward actionwhich slanderer he imitation callshe pageants us Sometime great Agamemnonthy topless deputation he puts onand like a strutting player whose conceitlies in his hamstring and doth think it richto hear the wooden dialogue and soundbtwixt his stretched footing and the scaffoldagesuch to-be-pitied and oer-wrested seeminghe acts thy greatness in and when he speaksitis like a chime a mending with terms unsquaredwhich from the tongue of roaring Typhon droppedwould seem hyperboles At this fusty stuffthe large Achilles on his pressed bed lollingfrom his deep chest laughs out a loud applausecries Excellent itis Agamemnon justnow play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beardas he being drest to some oration thats done as near as the extremest endsof parallels like as Vulcan and his wifeyet good Achilles still cries Excellentitis Nestor right now play him me Patroclusarming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of agemust be the scene of mirth to cough and spitand with a palsy-fumbling on his gorgetshake in and out the rivet and at this sportsir Valour dies cries O enough Patroclusor give me ribs of steel I shall split allin pleasure of my spleen and in this fashionall our abilities gifts natures shapesseverals and generals of grace exactachievements plots orders preventionsextements to the field or speech for trucesuccess or loss what is or is not servesas stuff for these two to make paradoxesand in the imitation of these twainwhom as Ulysses says opinion crownswith an imperial voice many are infectajax is grown self-willed and bears his headin such a rein in full as proud a placeas broad Achilles keeps his tent like himmakes factious feasts rails on our state of warbold as an oracle and sets Thersitesa slave whose gall coins slanders like a mintto match us in comparison with dirtto weaken and discredit our exposurehow rank soever rounded in with dangerthey tax our policy and call it cowardicecount wisdom as no member of the warforestall presence and esteem no actbut that of hand the still and mental partsthat do contrive how many hands shall strikewhen fitness calls them on and know by measureof their observant toil the enemies weightwhy this hath not a fingers dignitythey call this bed-work mappery closet-warso that the ram that batters down the wallfor the great swing and rudeness of his poisethey place before his hand that made the engineor those that with the fineness of their soulsby reason guides his executionlet this be granted and Achilles horsemakes many Thetis sonswhat trumpet look Menelausfrom Troywhat would you fore our tentis this great Agamemnons tent I pray youeven thismay one that is a herald and a princedo a fair message to his kingly earswith surety stronger than Achilles armfore all the Greekish heads which with one voicecall Agamemnon head and generalfair leave and large security how maya stranger to those most imperial looksknow them from eyes of other mortalshowayI ask that I might waken reverenceand bid the cheek be ready with a blushmodest as morning when she coldly eyesthe youthful Phoebuswhich is that god in office guiding menwhich is the high and mighty Agamemnonthis Trojan scorns us or the men of Troyare ceremonious courtierscourtiers as free as debonair unarmedas bending angels thats their fame in peacebut when they would seem soldiers they have gallsgood arms strong joints true swords and Joves accordnothing so full of heart but peace neaspeace Trojan lay thy finger on thy lipsthe worthiness of praise distains his worthif that the praised himself bring the praise forthbut what the repining enemy commendsthat breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcendssir you of Troy call you yourselfneasay Greek that is my namewhats your affair I pray yousir pardon itis for Agamemnons earshe hears nought privately that comes from Troynor I from Troy come not to whisper himI bring a trumpet to awake his earto set his sense on the attentive bentand then to speakspeak frankly as the windit is not Agamemnons sleeping hourthat thou shalt know Trojan he is awakehe tells thee so himselftrumpet blow aloudsend thy brass voice through all these lazy tentsand every Greek of mettle let him knowwhat Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloudwe have great Agamemnon here in Troya prince called Hector Priam is his fatherwho in this dull and long-continued truceis rusty grown he bade me take a trumpetand to this purpose speak kings princes lordsif there be one among the fairest of Greecethat holds his honour higher than his easethat seeks his praise more than he fears his perilthat knows his valour and knows not his fearthat loves his mistress more than in confessionwith truant vows to her own lips he lovesand dare avow her beauty and her worthin other arms than hers to him this challengehector in view of Trojans and of Greeksshall make it good or do his best to do ithe hath a lady wiser fairer truerthan ever Greek did compass in his armsand will to-morrow with his trumpet callmid-way between your tents and walls of Troyto rouse a Grean that is true in loveif any come Hector shall honour himif none hell say in Troy when he retiresthe Grean dames are sunburnt and not worththe splinter of a lance even so muchthis shall be told our lovers lordneasif none of them have soul in such a kindwe left them all at home but we are soldiersand may that soldier a mere recreant provethat means not hath not or is not in loveif then one is or hath or means to bethat one meets Hector if none else I am hetell him of Nestor one that was a manwhen Hectors grandsire sucked he is old nowbut if there be not in our Grean hostone noble man that hath one spark of fireto answer for his love tell him from meiull hide my silver beard in a gold beaverand in my vantbrace put this withered brawnand meeting him will tell him that my ladywas fairer than his grandam and as chasteas may be in the world his youth in floodiull prove this truth with my three drops of bloodnow heavens forbid such scarty of youthamenfair lordneas let me touch your handto our pavilion shall I lead you firstachilles shall have word of this intentso shall each lord of Greece from tent to tentyourself shall feast with us before you goand find the welcome of a noble foenestorwhat says UlyssesI have a young conception in my brainbe you my time to bring it to some shapewhat isitthis itisblunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pridethat hath to this maturity blown upin rank Achilles must or now be croppedor shedding breed a nursery of like evilto overbulk us allwell and howthis challenge that the gallant Hector sendshowever it is spread in general namerelates in purpose only to Achillesthe purpose is perspicuous even as substancewhose grossness little characters sum upand in the publication make no strainbut that Achilles were his brain as barrenas banks of Libya though Apollo knowsitis dry enough will with great speed of judgmentay with celerity find Hectors purposepointing on himand wake him to the answer think youyes itis most meet whom may you else opposethat can from Hector bring those honours offif not Achilles Thought be a sportful combatyet in the trial much opinion dwellsfor here the Trojans taste our dearest reputewith their finest palate and trust to me Ulyssesour imputation shall be oddly poisedin this wild action for the successalthough particular shall give a scantlingof good or bad unto the generaland in such indexes although small pricksto their subsequent volumes there is seenthe baby figure of the giant massof things to come at large it is supposedhe that meets Hector issues from our choiceand choice being mutual act of all our soulsmakes merit her election and doth boilas itwere from forth us all a man distilledout of our virtues who miscarryingwhat heart receives from bence the conquering partto steel a strong opinion to themselveswhich entertained limbs are his instrumentsin no less working than are swords and bowsdirective by the limbsgive pardon to my speechtherefore itis meet Achilles meet not Hectorlet us like merchants show our foulest waresand think perchance theyll sell if notthe lustre of the better yet to showshall show the better do not consentthat ever Hector and Achilles meetfor both our honour and our shame in thisare dogged with two strange followersI see them not with my old eyes what are theywhat glory our Achilles shares from Hectorwere he not proud we all should share with himbut he already is too insolentand we were better parch in Afric sunthan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyesshould he scape Hector fair if he were foiledwhy then we did our main opinion crushin taint of our best man no make a lotteryand by device let blockish Ajax drawthe sort to fight with Hector among ourselvesgive him allowance as the worthier manfor that will physic the great myrmidonwho broils in loud applause and make him fallhis crest that prouder than blue Iris bendsif the dull brainless Ajax come safe offwell dress him up in voices if he failyet go we under our opinion stillthat we have better men but hit or missour projects life this shape of sense assumesajax employed plucks down Achilles plumesulyssesnow I begin to relish thy adviceand I will give a taste of it forthwithto Agamemnon go we to him straighttwo curs shall tame each other pride alonemust tarre the mastiffs on as itwere their bonethersitesagamemnon how if he had boils full all over generallythersitesand those boils did run Say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy coredogthen would come some matter from him I see none nowthou bitch-wolfs son

railest every hour on Achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpinas beauty ay that thou barkest at himmistress Thersitesthou shouldst strike himcobloafhe would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuityou whoreson curdo dothou stool for a witchay do do thou sodden-witted lord thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows

whosoever you take him to be he is AjaxI know that foolay but that fool knows not himselftherefore I beat theelo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long I have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow this lord Achilles Ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head iull tell you what I say of himwhatI say this Ajaxnay good Ajaxhas not so much witnay I must hold youas will stop the eye of Helens needle for whom he comes to fightpeace foolI would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you thereO thou damned cur I shallwill you set your wit to a foolsno I warrant you for a fools will shame itgood words Thersiteswhats the quarrelI bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon meI serve thee notwell go to go toI serve here voluntaryyour last service was sufferance itwas not voluntary no man is beaten voluntary Ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impresseven so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars Hector shall have a great catch if he knock out either of your brains a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernelwhat with me too Thersitestheres Ulysses and old Nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draught-oxen and make you plough up the warswhat whatyes good sooth to Achilles to Ajax toI shall cut out your tongueitis no matter I shall speak as much as thou afterwardsno more words Thersites peaceI will hold my peace when Achilles brach bids me shall Itheres for you PatroclusI will see you hanged like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of foolsa good riddancemarry this sir is proclaimed through all our hostthat Hector by the fifth hour of the sunwill with a trumpet btwixt our tents and Troyto morrow morning call some knight to armsthat hath a stomach and such a one that daremaintain I know not what itis trash farewellfarewell who shall answer himI know not it is put to lottery otherwisehe knew his manO meaning you I will go learn more of itafter so many hours lives speeches spentthus once again says Nestor from the Greeksedeliver Helen and all damage elseas honour loss of time travail expensewounds friends and what else dear that is consumedin hot digestion of this cormorant warshall be struck off Hector what say you toitthough no man lesser fears the Greeks than Ias far as toucheth my particularyet dread Priamthere is no lady of more softer bowelsmore spongy to suck in the sense of fearmore ready to cry out who knows what follows than Hector is the wound of peace is suretysurety secure but modest doubt is calledthe beacon of the wise the tent that searchesto the bottom of the worst let Helen gosince the first sword was drawn about this questionevery tithe soul mongst many thousand dismeshath been as dear as Helen I mean of oursif we have lost so many tenths of oursto guard a thing not ours nor worth to ushad it our name the value of one tenwhat merits in that reason which deniesthe yielding of her upfie fie my brotherweigh you the worth and honour of a kingso great as our dread father in a scaleof common ounces will you with counters sumthe past proportion of his infiniteand buckle in a waist most fathomlesswith spans and inches so diminutiveas fears and reasons fie for godly shameno marvel though you bite so sharp at reasonsyou are so empty of them Should not our fatherbear the great sway of his affairs with reasonsbecause your speech hath none that tells him soyou are for dreams and slumbers brother priestyou fur your gloves with reason here are your reasonsyou know an enemy intends you harmyou know a sword employed is perilousand reason flies the object of all harmwho marvels then when Helenus beholdsa Grean and his sword if he do setthe very wings of reason to his heelsand fly like chidden Mercury from Joveor like a star disorbed nay if we talk of reasonlets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honourshould have hare-hearts would they but fat their thoughtswith this crammed reason reason and respectmake livers pale and lustihood dejectbrother she is not worth what she doth costthe holdingwhat is aught but as itis valuedbut value dwells not in particular willit holds his estimate and dignityas well wherein itis precious of itselfas in the prizer itis mad idolatryto make the service greater than the godand the will dotes that is inclinableto what infectiously itself affectswithout some image of the affected meritI take to-day a wife and my electionis led on in the conduct of my willmy will enkindled by mine eyes and earstwo traded pilots btwixt the dangerous shoresof will and judgment how may I avoidalthough my will distaste what it electedthe wife I chose there can be no evasionto blench from this and to stand firm by honourwe turn not back the silks upon the merchantwhen we have soiled them nor the remainder viandswe do not throw in unrespective sinkbecause we now are full it was thought meetparis should do some vengeance on the Greeksyour breath of full consent bellied his sailsthe seas and winds old wranglers took a truceand did him service he touched the ports desiredand for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captivehe brought a Grean queen whose youth and freshnesswrinkles Apollos and makes stale the morningwhy keep we her the Greans keep our auntis she worth keeping why she is a pearlwhose price hath launched above a thousand shipsand turned crowned kings to merchantsif youll avouch itwas wisdom Paris wentas you must needs for you all cried go go if youll confess he brought home noble prizeas you must needs for you all clapped your handsand cryed Inestimable why do you nowthe issue of your proper wisdoms rateand do a deed that fortune never didbeggar the estimation which you prizedricher than sea and land O theft most basethat we have stoln what we do fear to keepbut thieves unworthy of a thing so stolnthat in their country did them that disgracewe fear to warrant in our native placecry Trojans crywhat noise what shriekitis our mad sister I do know her voicecry Trojansit is Cassandracry Trojans cry lend me ten thousand eyesand I will fill them with prophetic tearspeace sister peacevirgins and boys mid-age and wrinkled eldsoft infancy that nothing canst but cryadd to my clamours let us pay betimesa moiety of that mass of moan to comecry Trojans cry practise your eyes with tearstroy must not be nor goodly Ilion standour firebrand brother Paris burns us allcry Trojans cry a Helen and a woecry cry Troy burns or else let Helen gonow youthful Troilus do not these high strainsof divination in our sister worksome touches of remorse or is your bloodso madly hot that no discourse of reasonnor fear of bad success in a bad causecan qualify the samewhy brother Hectorwe may not think the justness of each actsuch and no other than event doth form itnor once deject the courage of our mindsbecause Cassandras mad her brain-sick rapturescannot distaste the goodness of a quarrelwhich hath our several honours all engagedto make it gracious for my private partI am no more touched than all Priams sonsand Jove forbid there should be done amongst ussuch things as might offend the weakest spleento fight for and maintainelse might the world convince of levityas well my undertakings as your counselsbut I attest the gods your full consentgave wings to my propension and cut offall fears attending on so dire a projectfor what alas can these my single armswhat propugnation is in one mans valourto stand the push and enmity of thosethis quarrel would exte yet I protestwere I alone to pass the difficultiesand had as ample power as I have willparis should neer retract what he hath donenor faint in the pursuitparis you speaklike one besotted on your sweet delightsyou have the honey still but these the gallso to be valiant is no praise at allsir I propose not merely to myselfthe pleasure such a beauty brings with itbut I would have the soil of her fair rapewiped off in honourable keeping herwhat treason were it to the ransacked queendisgrace to your great worths and shame to menow to deliver her possession upon terms of base compulsion can it bethat so degenerate a strain as thisshould once set footing in your generous bosomstheres not the meanest spirit on our partywithout a heart to dare or sword to drawwhen Helen is defended nor none so noblewhose life were ill bestowed or death unfamedwhere Helen is the subject then I saywell may we fight for her whom we know wellthe worlds large spaces cannot parallelparis and Troilus you have both said welland on the cause and question now in handhave glozed but superfially not muchunlike young men whom Aristotle thoughtunfit to hear moral philosophythe reasons you allege do more conduceto the hot passion of distempered bloodthan to make up a free determinationbtwixt right and wrong for pleasure and revengehave ears more deaf than adders to the voiceof any true desion nature cravesall dues be rendered to their owners nowwhat nearer debt in all humanitythan wife is to the husband if this lawof nature be corrupted through affectionand that great minds of partial indulgenceto their benumbed wills resist the sainethere is a law in each well-ordered nationto curb those raging appetites that aremost disobedient and refractoryif Helen then be wife to Spartas kingas it is known she is these moral lawsof nature and of nations speak aloudto have her back returned thus to persistin doing wrong extenuates not wrongbut makes it much more heavy Hectors opinionis this in way of truth yet neerthelessmy spritely brethren I propend to youin resolution to keep Helen stillfor itis a cause that hath no mean dependanceupon our joint and several dignitieswhy there you touched the life of our designwere it not glory that we more affectedthan the performance of our heaving spleensI would not wish a drop of Trojan bloodspent more in her defence but worthy Hectorshe is a theme of honour and renowna spur to valiant and magnanimous deedswhose present courage may beat down our foesand fame in time to come canonize usfor I presume brave Hector would not loseso rich advantage of a promised gloryas smiles upon the forehead of this actionfor the wide worlds revenueI am yoursyou valiant offspring of great PriamusI have a roisting challenge sent amongstthe dull and factious nobles of the Greekswill strike amazement to their drowsy spiritsI was advertised their great general sleptwhilst emulation in the army creptthis I presume will wake himhow now Thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus he beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he railed at me Sfoot iull learn to conjure and raise devils but iull see some issue of my spiteful execrations then theres Achilles a rare enginer if Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in rcumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan bone-ache for that methinks is the curse dependant on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say amen what ho my lord Achilleswhos there Thersites Good Thersites come in and railif I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and displine come not near thee let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corpse iull be sworn and sworn uponit she never shrouded any but lazars amen wheres Achilleswhat art thou devout wast thou in prayeray the heavens hear mewhos therethersites my lordwhere where art thou come why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals come whats Agamemnonthy commander Achilles then tell me Patroclus whats Achillesthy lord Thersites then tell me I pray thee whats thyselfthy knower Patroclus then tell me Patroclus what art thouthou mayst tell that knowestO tell telliull decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus knower and Patroclus is a foolyou rascalpeace fool I have not donehe is a privileged man proceed Thersitesagamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a foolderive this comeagamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and Patroclus is a fool positivewhy am I a foolmake that demand to the Creator it suffices me thou art look you who comes herepatroclus iull speak with nobody come in with me Thersiteshere is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound allwhere is Achilleswithin his tent but ill-disposed my lordlet it be known to him that we are herehe shent our messengers and we lay byour appertainments visiting of himlet him be told so lest perchance he thinkwe dare not move the question of our placeor know not what we areI shall say so to himwe saw him at the opening of his tenthe is not sickyes lion-sick sick of proud heart you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head itis pride but why why let him show us a cause a word my lordwhat moves Ajax thus to bay at himachilles hath inveigled his fool from himwho Thersiteshethen will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argumentno you see he is his argument that has his argument Achillesall the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunitethe amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes Patroclusno Achilles with himthe elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexureachilles bids me say he is much sorryif any thing more than your sport and pleasuredid move your greatness and this noble stateto call upon him he hopes it is no otherbut for your health and your digestion sakean after-dinners breathhear you Patrocluswe are too well acquainted with these answersbut his evasion winged thus swift with scorncannot outfly our apprehensionsmuch attribute he hath and much the reasonwhy we ascribe it to him yet all his virtuesnot virtuously on his own part behelddo in our eyes begin to lose their glossyea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dishare like to rot untasted go and tell himwe come to speak with him and you shall not sinif you do say we think him over-proudand under-honest in self-assumption greaterthan in the note of judgment and worthier than himselfhere tend the savage strangeness he puts ondisguise the holy strength of their commandand underwrite in an observing kindhis humorous predominance yea watchhis pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as ifthe passage and whole carriage of this actionrode on his tide go tell him this and addthat if he overhold his price so muchwell none of him but let him like an enginenot portable lie under this reportbring action hither this cannot go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance givebefore a sleeping giant tell him soI shall and bring his answer presentlyin second voice well not be satisfiedwe come to speak with him Ulysses enter youwhat is he more than anotherno more than what he thinks he isis he so much do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I amno questionwill you subscribe his thought and say he isno noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractablewhy should a man be proud how doth pride grow I know not what pride isyour mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praiseI do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering of toadsyet he loves himself isit not strangeachilles will not to the field to-morrowwhats his excusehe doth rely on nonebut carries on the stream of his disposewithout observance or respect of anyin will peculiar and in self-admissionwhy will he not upon our fair requestuntent his person and share the air with usthings small as nothing for requests sake onlyhe makes important possessed he is with greatnessand speaks not to himself but with a pridethat quarrels at self-breath imagined worthholds in his blood such swoln and hot discoursethat btwixt his mental and his active partskingdomed Achilles in commotion ragesand batters down himself what should I sayhe is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of itcry no recovery let Ajax go to himdear lord go you and meet him in his tentitis said he holds you well and will be ledat your request a little from himselfO Agamemnon let it not be sowell consecrate the steps that Ajax makeswhen they go from Achilles shall the proud lordthat bastes his arrogance with his own seamand never suffers matter of the worldenter his thoughts save such as do revolveand ruminate himself shall he be worshippedof that we hold an idol more than heno this thrice-worthy and right valiant lordmust not so stale his palm nobly acquirednor by my will assubjugate his meritas amply titled as Achilles isby going to Achillesthat were to enlard his fat-already prideand add more coals to Cancer when he burnswith entertaining great Hyperionthis lord go to him Jupiter forbidand say in thunder Achilles go to him O this is well he rubs the vein of himand how his silence drinks up this applauseif I go to him with my armed fistiull pash him oer the faceO no you shall not goan a be proud with me iull pheeze his pridelet me go to himnot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrela paltry insolent fellowhow he describes himselfcan he not be soablethe raven chides blacknessiull let his humours bloodhe will be the physian that should be the patientan all men were o my mindwit would be out of fashiona should not bear it so a should eat swords first shall pride carry itant would youed carry halfa would have ten sharesI will knead him I will make him supplehes not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is drymy lord you feed too much on this dislikeour noble general do not do soyou must prepare to fight without Achilleswhy itis this naming of him does him harmhere is a man but itis before his faceI will be silentwherefore should you sohe is not emulous as Achilles isknow the whole world he is as valianta whoreson dog that shall palter thus with us would he were a Trojanwhat a vice were it in Ajax nowif he were proudor covetous of praiseay or surly borneor strange or self-affectedthank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composurepraise him that got thee her that gave thee suckfamed be thy tutor and thy parts of naturethrice-famed beyond all eruditionbut he that displined thy arms to fightlet Mars divide eternity in twainand give him half and for thy vigourbull-bearing Milo his addition yieldto sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdomwhich like a bourn a pale a shore confinesthy spaous and dilated parts heres Nestorinstructed by the antiquary timeshe must he is he cannot but be wisebut pardon father Nestor were your daysas green as Ajax and your brain so temperedyou should not have the eminence of himbut be as Ajaxshall I call you fatheray my good sonbe ruled by him lord Ajaxthere is no tarrying here the hart Achilleskeeps thicket please it our great generalto call together all his state of warfresh kings are come to Troy to-morrowwe must with all our main of power stand fastand heres a lord come

O be thou my Charonand give me swift transportance to those fieldswhere I may wallow in the lily-bedsproposed for the deserver O gentle Pandarusfrom Cupids shoulder pluck his painted wingsand fly with me to Cressidwalk here inthe orchard iull bring her straightI am giddy expectation whirls me roundthe imaginary relish is so sweetthat it enchants my sense what will it bewhen that the watery palate tastes indeedloves thrice-repured nectar death I fear meswounding destruction or some joy too finetoo subtle-potent tuned too sharp in sweetnessfor the capaty of my ruder powersI fear it much and I do fear besidesthat I shall lose distinction in my joysas doth a battle when they charge on heapsthe enemy flyingshes making her ready shell come straight you must be witty now she does so blush and fetches her wind so short as if she were frayed with a sprite iull fetch her it is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a new-taen sparroweven such a passion doth embrace my bosommy heart beats thicker than a fevrous pulseand all my powers do their bestowing loselike vassalage at unawares encounteringthe eye of majestycome come what need you blush shames a baby here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me what are you gone again you must be watched ere you be made tame must you come your ways come your ways an you draw backward well put you inthe fills why do you not speak to her come draw this curtain and lets see your picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend day-light an itwere dark youed close sooner so so rub on and kiss the mistress how now a kiss in fee-farm build there carpenter the air is sweet nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you the falcon as the tercel for all the ducks inthe

witness whereof the parties interchangeably come in come in iull go get a firewill you walk in my lordO Cressida how often have I wished me thuswished my lord the gods grant O my lordwhat should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our lovemore dregs than water if my fears have eyesfears make devils of cherubins they never see trulyblind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worseO let my lady apprehend no fear in all Cupids pageant there is presented no monsternor nothing monstrous neithernothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limitthey say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monstersare there such such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troiluswill you walk in my lordwhat blushing still have you not done talking yetwell uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to youI thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you youll give him me be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for ityou know now your hostages your uncles word and my firm faithnay iull give my word for her too our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burrs I can tell you theyll stick where they are thrownboldness comes to me now and brings me heartprince Troilus I have loved you night and dayfor many weary monthswhy was my Cressid then so hard to winhard to seem won but I was won my lordwith the first glance that ever pardon meif I confess much you will play the tyrantI love you now but till now not so muchbut I might master it in faith I liemy thoughts were like unbridled children growntoo headstrong for their mother See we foolswhy have I blabbed who shall be true to uswhen we are so unsecret to ourselvesbut though I loved you well I wooed you notand yet good faith I wished myself a manor that we women had mens privilegeof speaking first sweet bid me hold my tonguefor in this rapture I shall surely speakthe thing I shall repent See see your silencecunning in dumbness from my weakness drawsmy very soul of counsel Stop my mouthand shall albeit sweet music issues thencepretty infaithmy lord I do beseech you pardon meitwas not my purpose thus to beg a kissI am ashamed O heavens what have I donefor this time will I take my leave my lordyour leave sweet Cressidleave an you take leave till to-morrow morningpray you content youwhat offends you ladysir mine own companyyou cannot shun yourselflet me go and tryI have a kind of self resides with youbut an unkind self that itself will leaveto be anothers fool I would be gonewhere is my wit I speak I know not whatwell know they what they speak that speak so wiselyperchance my lord I show more craft than loveand fell so roundly to a large confessionto angle for your thoughts but you are wiseor else you love not for to be wise and loveexceeds mans might that dwells with gods aboveO that I thought it could be in a womanas if it can I will presume in youto feed for aye her lamp and flames of loveto keep her constancy in plight and youthoutliving beautys outward with a mindthat doth renew swifter than blood decaysor that persuasion could but thus convince methat my integrity and truth to youmight be affronted with the match and weightof such a winnowed purity in lovehow were I then uplifted but alasI am as true as truths simplityand simpler than the infancy of truthin that iull war with youO virtuous fightwhen right with right wars who shall be most righttrue swains in love shall in the world to comeapprove their truths by Troilus when their rimesfull of protest of oath and big comparewant similes truth tired with iterationas true as steel as plantage to the moonas sun to day as turtle to her mateas iron to adamant as earth to the centreyet after all comparisons of truthas truths authentic author to be tedas true as Troilus shall crown up the verseand sanctify the numbersprophet may you beif I be false or swerve a hair from truthwhen time is old and hath forgot itselfwhen waterdrops have worn the stones of Troyand blind oblivion swallowed ties upand mighty states characterless are gratedto dusty nothing yet let memoryfrom false to false among false maids in loveupbraid my falsehood when they have said as falseas air as water wind or sandy earthas fox to lamb as wolf to heifers calfpard to the hind or stepdame to her son yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehoodas false as Cressid go to a bargain made seal it seal it iull be the witness here I hold your hand here my cousins if ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers-between be called to the worlds end after my name call them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers-between Pandars say amenamenamenamen whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death awayand Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens herebed chamber Pandar to provide this gearnow princes for the service I have done youthe advantage of the time prompts me aloudto call for recompense Appear it to your mindthat through the sight I bear in things to comeI have abandoned Troy left my possessionincurred a traitors name exposed myselffrom certain and possessed conveniencesto doubtful fortunes sequestering from me allthat time acquaintance custom and conditionmade tame and most familiar to my natureand here to do you service have becomeas new into the world strange unacquaintedI do beseech you as in way of tasteto give me now a little benefitout of those many registered in promisewhich you say live to come in my behalfwhat wouldst thou of us Trojan make demandyou have a Trojan prisoner called Antenoryesterday took Troy holds him very dearoft have you often have you thanks thereforedesired my Cressid in right great exchangewhom Troy hath still denied but this AntenorI know is such a wrest in their affairsthat their negoations all must slackwanting his manage and they will almostgive us a prince of blood a son of Priamin change of him let him be sent great princesand he shall buy my daughter and her presenceshall quite strike off all service I have donein most accepted painlet Diomedes bear himand bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall havewhat he requests of us Good Diomedfurnish you fairly for this interchangewithal bring word if Hector will to-morrowbe answered in his challenge Ajax is readythis shall I undertake and itis a burdenwhich I am proud to bearachilles stands in the entrance of his tentplease it our general to pass strangely by himas if he were forgot and princes alllay negligent and loose regard upon himI will come last itis like hell question mewhy such unplausive eyes are bent on himif so I have derision mednableto use between your strangeness and his pridewhich his own will shall have desire to drinkit may do good pride hath no other glassto show itself but pride for supple kneesfeed arrogance and are the poor mans feeswell execute your purpose and put ona form of strangeness as we pass alongso do each lord and either greet him notor else disdainfully which shall shake him morethan if not looked on I will lead the waywhat comes the general to speak with meyou know my mind iull fight no more gainst Troywhat says Achilles would he aught with uswould you my lord aught with the generalnonothing my lordthe bettergood day good dayhow do you how do youwhat does the cuckold scorn mehow now Patroclusgood morrow Ajaxhagood morroway and good next day toowhat mean these fellows know they not Achillesthey pass by strangely they were used to bendto send their smiles before them to Achillesto come as humbly as they used to creepto holy altarswhat am I poor of lateitis certain greatness once falln out with fortunemust fall out with men too what the declined ishe shall as soon read in the eyes of othersas feel in his own fall for men like butterfliesshow not their mealy wings but to the summerand not a man for being simply manhath any honour but honour for those honoursthat are without him as places riches and favourprizes of acdent as oft as meritwhich when they fall as being slippery standersthe love that leaned on them as slippery toodo one pluck down another and togetherdie in the fall but itis not so with mefortune and I are friends I do enjoyat ample point all that I did possesssave these mens looks who do methinks find outsomething not worth in me such rich beholdingas they have often given here is Ulyssesiull interrupt his readinghow now Ulyssesnow great Thetis sonwhat are you readinga strange fellow herewrites methat man how dearly ever partedhow much in having or without or incannot make boast to have that which he hathnor feels not what he owes but by reflectionas when his virtues shining upon othersheat them and they retort that heat againto the first giverthis is not strange Ulyssesthe beauty that is borne here in the facethe bearer knows not but commends itselfto others eyes nor doth the eye itselfthat most pure spirit of sense behold itselfnot going from itself but eye to eye opposedsalutes each other with each others formfor speculation turns not to itselftill it hath travelled and is mirrored therewhere it may see itself this is not strange at allI do not strain at the positionit is familiar but at the authors driftwho in his rcumstance expressly provesthat no man is the lord of any thingthough in and of him there be much consistingtill he communicate his parts to othersnor doth he of himself know them for aughttill he behold them formed in the applausewhere theyre extended who like an arch reverberatesthe voice again or like a gate of steelfronting the sun receives and renders backhis figure and his heat I was much rapt in thisand apprehended here immediatelythe unknown Ajaxheavens what a man is there a very horsethat has he knows not what nature what things there aremost abject in regard and dear in usewhat things again most dear in the esteemand poor in worth now shall we see to-morrowan act that very chance doth throw upon himajax renowned O heavens what some men dowhile some men leave to dohow some men creep in skittish fortunes hallwhiles others play the idiots in her eyeshow one man eats into anothers pridewhile pride is fasting in his wantonnessto see these Grean lords why even alreadythey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulderas if his foot were on brave Hectors breastand great Troy shrinkingI do believe it for they passed by meas misers do by beggars neither gave to megood word or look what are my deeds forgottime hath my lord a wallet at his backwherein he puts alms for obliviona great-sized monster of ingratitudesthose scraps are good deeds past which are devouredas fast as they are made forgot as soonas done perseverance dear my lordkeeps honour bright to have done is to hangquite out of fashion like a rusty mailin monumental mockery take the instant wayfor honour travels in a strait so narrowwhere one but goes abreast keep then the pathfor emulation hath a thousand sonsthat one by one pursue if you give wayor hedge aside from the direct forthrightlike to an entered tide they all rush byand leave you hindmostor like a gallant horse falln in first ranklie there for pavement to the abject rearoerrun and trampled on then what they do in presentthough less than yours in past must oertop yoursfor time is like a fashionable hostthat slightly shakes his parting guest by the handand with his arms outstretched as he would flygrasps in the comer welcome ever smilesand farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seekremuneration for the thing it wasfor beauty withigh birth vigour of bone desert in servicelove friendship charity are subjects allto envious and calumniating timeone touch of nature makes the whole world kinthat all with one consent praise new-born gawdsthough they are made and moulded of things pastand give to dust that is a little giltmore laud than gilt oer-dustedthe present eye praises the present objectthen marvel not thou great and complete manthat all the Greeks begin to worship Ajaxsince things in motion sooner catch the eyethan what not stirs the cry went once on theeand still it might and yet it may againif thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveand case thy reputation in thy tentwhose glorious deeds but in these fields of latemade emulous missions mongst the gods themselvesand drave great Mars to factionof this my privacyI have strong reasonsbut gainst your privacythe reasons are more potent and heroicalitis known Achilles that you are in lovewith one of Priams daughtersha knownis that a wonderthe providence thats in a watchful stateknows almost every grain of Plutus goldfinds bottom in the uncomprehensive deepskeeps place with thought and almost like the godsdoes thoughts unveil in their dumb cradlesthere is a mystery with whom relationdurst never meddle in the soul of statewhich hath an operation more divinethan breath or pen can give expressure toall the commerce that you have had with Troyas perfectly is ours as yours my lordand better would it fit Achilles muchto throw down Hector than Polyxenabut it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at homewhen fame shall in our islands sound her trumpand all the Greekish girls shall tripping singgreat Hectors sister did Achilles winbut our great Ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord I as your lover speakthe fool slides oer the ice that you should breakto this effect Achilles have I moved youa woman impudent and mannish grownis not more loathed than an effeminate manin time of action I stand condemned for thisthey think my little stomach to the warand your great love to me restrains you thussweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupidshall from your neck unloose his amorous foldand like a dew-drop from the lions manebe shook to airshall Ajax fight with Hectoray and perhaps receive much honour by himI see my reputation is at stakemy fame is shrewdly goredO then bewarethose wounds heal ill that men do give themselvesomission to do what is necessaryseals a commission to a blank of dangerand danger like an ague subtly taintseven then when we sit idly in the sungo call Thersites hither sweet Patroclusiull send the fool to Ajax and desire himt invite the Trojan lords after the combatto see us here unarmed I have a womans longingan appetite that I am sick withalto see great Hector in his weeds of peaceto talk with him and to behold his visageeven to my full of view a labour saveda wonderwhatajax goes up and down the field asking for himselfhow sohe must fight singly to-morrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothinghow can that bewhy he stalks up and down like a peacock a stride and a stand ruminates like a hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the mans undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck inthe combat hell breakt himself in vainglory he knows not me I said Good morrow Ajax and he replies thanks Agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general Hes grown a very land-fish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like a leather jerkinthou must be my ambassador to him Thersiteswho I why hell answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in his arms I will put on his presence let Patroclus make demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajaxto him Patroclus tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured captain-general of the Grean army Agamemnon etcetera do thisjove bless great AjaxhumI come from the worthy Achilleshawho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tenthumand to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnonagamemnonay my lordhawhat say you toitgod be wityou with all my heartyour answer sirif to-morrow be a fair day by eleven oclock it will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has meyour answer sirfare you well with all my heartwhy but he is not in this tune is heno but hes out o tune thus what music will be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings oncome thou shalt bear a letter to him straightlet me bear another to his horse for thats the more capable creaturemy mind is troubled like a fountain stirredand I myself see not the bottom of itwould the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorancesee ho who is that thereit is the lordneasis the prince there in personhad I so good occasion to lie longas you prince Paris nothing but heavenly businessshould rob my bed-mate of my companythats my mind too Good morrow lordneasa valiant Greek neas take his handwitness the process of your speech whereinyou told how Diomed a whole week by daysdid haunt you in the fieldhealth to you valiant sirduring all question of the gentle trucebut when I meet you armed as black defianceas heart can think or courage executethe one and other Diomed embracesour bloods are now in calm and so long healthbut when contention and occasion meetby Jove iull play the hunter for thy lifewith all my force pursuit and policyand thou shalt hunt a lion that will flywith his face backward in humane gentlenesswelcome to Troy now by Anchises lifewelcome indeed by Venus hand I swearno man alive can love in such a sortthe thing he means to kill more excellentlywe sympathize Jove letneas liveif to my sword his fate be not the glorya thousand complete courses of the sunbut in mine emulous honour let him diewith every joint a wound and that to-morrowwe know each other wellwe do and long to know each other worsethis is the most despiteful gentle greetingthe noblest hateful love that eer I heard ofwhat business lord so earlyI was sent for to the king but why I know nothis purpose meets you itwas to bring this Greekto Calchas house and there to render himfor the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressidlets have your company or if you pleasehaste there before us I constantly do thinkor rather call my thought a certain knowledgemy brother Troilus lodges there to-nightrouse him and give him note of our approachwith the whole quality wherefore I fearwe shall be much unwelcomethat I assure youtroilus had rather Troy were borne to Greecethan Cressid borne from Troythere is no helpthe bitter disposition of the timewill have it so on lord well follow yougood morrow alland tell me noble Diomed faith tell me trueeven in the soul of sound good-fellowshipwho in your thoughts merits fair Helen bestmyself or Menelausboth alikehe merits well to have her that doth seek hernot making any scruple of her soilurewith such a hell of pain and world of chargeand you as well to keep her that defend hernot palating the taste of her dishonourwith such a costly loss of wealth and friendshe like a puling cuckold would drink upthe lees and dregs of a flat tamed pieceyou like a lecher out of whorish loinsare pleased to breed out your inheritorsboth merits poised each weighs nor less nor morebut he as he the heavier for a whoreyou are too bitter to your country-womanshes bitter to her country Hear me Parisfor every false drop in her bawdy veinsa Greans life hath sunk for every scrupleof her contaminated carrion weighta Trojan hath been slain Since she could speakshe hath not given so many good words breathas for her Greeks and Trojans suffered deathfair Diomed you do as chapmen dodispraise the thing that you desire to buybut we in silence hold this virtue wellwell not commend what we intend to sellhere lies our waydear trouble not yourself the morn is coldthen sweet my lord iull call mine uncle downhe shall unbolt the gatestrouble him notto bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyesand give as soft attachment to thy sensesas infants empty of all thoughtgood morrow thenI prithee now to bedare you aweary of meO Cressida but that the busy daywaked by the lark hath roused the ribald crowsand dreaming night will hide our joys no longerI would not from theenight hath been too briefbeshrew the witch with venomous wights she staysas tediously as hell but flies the grasps of

more my grief in such a precious losshere here here he comes ah sweet ducksO Troilus Troiluswhat a pair of spectacles is here let me embrace too O heart as the goodly saying isO heart heavy heartwhy sighest thou without breakingwhen he answers againbecause thou canst not ease thy smartby friendship nor by speakingthere was never a truer rime let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse we see it we see it how now lambscressid I love thee in so strained a puritythat the blessed gods as angry with my fancymore bright in zeal than the devotion whichcold lips blow to their deities take thee from mehave the gods envyay ay ay ay itis too plain a caseand is it true that I must go from Troya hateful truthwhat and from Troilus toofrom Troy and Troilusis it possibleand suddenly where injury of chanceputs back leave-taking justles roughly byall time of pause rudely beguiles our lipsof all rejoindure forbly preventsour locked embrasures strangles our dear vowseven in the birth of our own labouring breathwe two that with so many thousand sighsdid buy each other must poorly sell ourselveswith the rude brevity and discharge of oneinjurious time now with a robbers hastecrams his rich thievery up he knows not howas many farewells as be stars in heavenwith distinct breath and consigned kisses to themhe fumbles up into a loose adieuand scants us with a single famished kissdistasted with the salt of broken tearsmy lord is the lady readyhark you are called some say the genius socries come to him that instantly must diebid them have patience she shall come anonwhere are my tears rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by the rootI must then to the Greansno remedya woeful Cressid mongst the merry Greekswhen shall we see againhear me my love be thou but true of heartI true how now what wicked deem is thisnay we must use expostulation kindlyfor it is parting from usI speak not be thou true as fearing theefor I will throw my glove to death himselfthat theres no maculation in thy heartbut be thou true say I to fashion inmy sequent protestation be thou trueand I will see theeO you shall be exposed my lord to dangersas infinite as imminent but iull be trueand iull grow friend with danger wear this sleeveand you this glove when shall I see youI will corrupt the Grean sentinelsto give thee nightly visitationbut yet be trueO heavens be true againhear why I speak it lovethe Grean youths are full of qualitytheyre loving well composed with gifts of natureflowing and swelling oer with arts and exersehow novelty may move and parts with personalas a kind of godly jealousywhich I beseech you call a virtuous sinmakes me afearedO heavens you love me notdie I a villain thenin this I do not call your faith in questionso mainly as my merit I cannot singnor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talknor play at subtle games fair virtues allto which the Greans are most prompt and pregnantbut I can tell that in each grace of thesethere lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devilthat tempts most cunningly but be not tempteddo you think I willnobut something may be done that we will notand sometimes we are devils to ourselveswhen we will tempt the frailty of our powerspresuming on their changeful potencynay good my lordcome kiss and let us partbrother Troilusgood brother come you hitherand bringneas and the Grean with youmy lord will you be truewho I alas it is my vice my faultwhile others fish with craft for great opinionI with

reach of itwelcome sir Diomed here is the ladywhich for Antenor we deliver youat the port lord iull give her to thy handand by the way possess thee what she isentreat her fair and by my soul fair Greekif eer thou stand at mercy of my swordname Cressid and thy life shall be as safeas Priam is in Ilionfair Lady Cressidso please you save the thanks this prince expectsthe lustre in your eye

Nestoriull take that winter from your lips fair ladyachilles bids you welcomeI had good argument for kissing oncebut thats no argument for kissing nowfor thus popped Paris in his hardimentand

coasting welcome ere it comesand wide unclasp the tables of their thoughtsto every tickling reader set them downfor sluttish spoils of opportunityand daughters of the gamehail all you state of Greece what shall be doneto him that victory commands or do you purposea victor shall be known will you the knightsshall to the edge of all extremitypursue each other or shall be dividedby any voice or order of the fieldhector bade askwhich way would Hector have ithe cares not hell obey conditionsitis done like Hector but securely donea little proudly and great deal misprisingthe knight opposedif not Achilles sirwhat is your nameif not Achilles nothingtherefore Achilles but whateer know thisin the extremity of great and littlevalour and pride excel themselves in Hectorthe one almost as infinite as allthe other blank as nothing Weigh him welland that which looks like pride is courtesythis Ajax is half made of Hectors bloodin love whereof half Hector stays at homehalf heart half hand half Hector comes to seekthis blended knight half Trojan and half Greeka maiden battle then O I perceive youhere is sir Diomed go gentle knightstand by our Ajax as you and lordneasconsent upon the order of their fightso be it either to the uttermostor else a breath the combatants being kinhalf stints their strife before their strokes beginthey are opposed alreadywhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavythe youngest son of Priam a true knightnot yet mature yet matchless firm of wordspeaking in deeds and deedless in his tonguenot soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmedhis heart and hand both open and both freefor what he has he gives what thinks he showsyet gives he not till judgment guide his bountynor dignifies an impure thought with breathmanly as Hector but more dangerousfor Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribesto tender objects but he in heat of actionis more vindicative than jealous lovethey call him Troilus and on him erecta second hope as fairly built as Hectorthus saysneas one that knows the youtheven to his inches and with private souldid in great Ilion thus translate him to methey are in actionnow Ajax hold thine ownhector thou sleepest awake theehis blows are well disposed there Ajaxyou must no moreprinces enough so please youI am not warm yet let us fight againas Hector pleaseswhy then will I no morethou art great lord my fathers sisters sona cousin-german to great Priams seedthe obligation of our blood forbidsa gory emulationitwixt us twainwere thy commixtion Greek and Trojan sothat thou couldst say this hand is Grean alland this is Trojan the sinews of this legall Greek and this all Troy my mothers bloodruns on the dexter cheek and this sinisterbounds in my fathers by Jove multipotentthou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish memberwherein my sword had not impressure madeof our rank feud but the just gods gainsaythat any drop thou borrowedst from thy mothermy sacred aunt should by my mortal swordbe drained let me embrace thee Ajaxby him that thunders thou hast lusty armshector would have them fall upon him thuscousin all honour to theeI thank thee Hectorthou art too gentle and too free a manI came to kill thee cousin and bear hencea great addition earned in thy deathnot Neoptolemus so mirableon whose bright crest fame with her loudest byescries this is he could promise to himselfa thought of added honour torn from Hectorthere is expectance here from both the sideswhat further you will dowell answer itthe issue is embracement Ajax farewellif I might in entreaties find successas seld I have the chance I would desiremy famous cousin to our Grean tentsitis Agamemnons wish and great Achillesdoth long to see unarmed the valiant Hectorneas call my brother Troilus to meand signify this loving interviewto the expecters of our Trojan partdesire them home give me thy hand my cousinI will go eat with thee and see your knightsgreat Agamemnon comes to meet us herethe worthiest of them tell me name by namebut for Achilles mine own searching eyesshall find him by his large and portly sizeworthy of arms as welcome as to onethat would be rid of such an enemybut thats no welcome understand more clearwhats past and whats to come is strewed with husksand formless ruin of oblivionbut in this extant moment faith and trothstrained purely from all hollow bias-drawingbids thee with most divine integrityfrom heart of very heart great Hector welcomeI thank thee most imperious Agamemnonmy well-famed lord of Troy no less to youlet me confirm my princely brothers greetingyou brace of war-like brothers welcome hitherwhom must we answerthe noble MenelausO you my lord by Mars his gauntlet thanksmock not that I affect the untraded oathyour quondam wife swears still by Venus gloveshes well but bade me not commend her to youname her not now sir shes a deadly themeO pardon I offendI have thou gallant Trojan seen thee oftlabouring for destiny make cruel waythrough ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen theeas hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steeddespising many forfeits and subduementswhen thou hast hung thy advanced sword inthe airnot letting it decline on the declinedthat I have said to some my standers-bylo Jupiter is yonder dealing life and I have seen thee pause and take thy breathwhen that a ring of Greeks have hemmed thee inlike an Olympian wrestling this have I seenbut this thy countenance still locked in steelI never saw till now I

seeah poor our sex this fault in us I findthe error of our eye directs our mindwhat error leads must err O then concludeminds swayed by eyes are full of turpitudea proof of strength she could not publish moreunless she said my mind is now turned whore alls done my lordit iswhy stay we thento make a recordation to my soulof every syllable that here was spokebut if I tell how these two did co-actshall I not lie in publishing a truthsith yet there is a credence in my heartan esperance so obstinately strongthat doth invert the attest of eyes and earsas if those organs had deceptions functionscreated only to calumniatewas Cressid hereI cannot conjure Trojanshe was not suremost sure she waswhy my negation hath no taste of madnessnor mine my lord Cressid was here but nowlet it not be believed for womanhoodthink we had mothers do not give advantageto stubborn critics apt without a themefor depravation to square the general sexby Cressids rule rather think this not Cressidwhat hath she done prince that can soil our mothersnothing at all unless that this were shewill he swagger himself out ons own eyesthis she no this is Diomeds Cressidaif beauty have a soul this is not sheif souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonyif sanctimony be the gods delightif there be rule in unity itselfthis is not she O madness of discoursethat cause sets up with and against itselfbi-fold authority where reason can revoltwithout perdition and loss assume all reasonwithout revolt this is and is not Cressidwithin my soul there doth conduce a fightof this strange nature that a thing inseparatedivides more wider than the sky and earthand yet the spaous breadth of this divisionadmits no orifice for a point as subtleas Ariachnes broken woof to enterinstance O instance strong as Plutos gatescressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaveninstance O instance strong as heaven itselfthe bonds of heaven are slipped dissolved and loosedand with another knot five-finger-tiedthe fractions of her faith orts of her lovethe fragments scraps the bits and greasy reliquesof her oer-eaten faith are bound to Diomedmay worthy Troilus be half attachedwith that which here his passion doth expressay Greek and that shall be divulged wellin characters as red as Mars his heartinflamed with Venus never did young man fancywith so eternal and so fixed a soulhark Greek as much as I do Cressid loveso much by weight hate I her Diomedthat sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helmwere it a casque composed by Vulcans skillmy sword should bite it not the dreadful spoutwhich shipmen do the hurricano callconstringed in mass by the almighty sunshall dizzy with more clamour Neptunes earin his descent than shall my prompted swordfalling on Diomedhell tickle it for his concupyO Cressid O false Cressid false false falselet all untruths stand by thy stained nameand theyll seem gloriousO contain yourselfyour passion draws ears hitherI have been seeking you this hour my lordhector by this is arming him in Troyajax your guard stays to conduct you homehave with you prince my courteous lord adieufarewell revolted fair and Diomedstand fast and wear a castle on thy headiull bring you to the gatesaccept distracted thankswould I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus would give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery lechery still wars and lechery nothing else holds fashion a burning devil take themwhen was my lord so much ungently temperedto stop his ears against admonishmentunarm unarm and do not fight to-dayyou train me to offend you get you inby all the everlasting gods iull gomy dreams will sure prove ominous to the dayno more I saywhere is my brother Hectorhere sister armed and bloody in intentconsort with me in loud and dear petitionpursue we him on knees for I have dreamedof bloody turbulence and this whole nighthath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughterO itis trueho bid my trumpet soundno notes of sally for the heavens sweet brotherbe gone I say the gods have heard me swearthe gods are deaf to hot and peevish vowsthey are polluted offerings more abhorredthan spotted livers in the sacrificeO be persuaded do not count it holyto hurt by being just it is as lawfulfor we would give much to use violent theftsand rob in the behalf of charityit is the purpose that makes strong the vowbut vows to every purpose must not holdunarm sweet Hectorhold you still I saymine honour keeps the weather of my fatelife every man holds dear but the dear manholds honour far more precious-dear than lifehow now young man meanest thou to fight to-daycassandra call my father to persuadeno faith young Troilus doff thy harness youthI am to-day inthe vein of chivalrylet grow thy sinews till their knots be strongand tempt not yet the brushes of the warunarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boyiull stand to-day for thee and me and Troybrother you have a vice of mercy in youwhich better fits a lion than a manwhat vice is that good Troilus chide me for itwhen many times the captive Grean fallseven in the fan and wind of your fair swordyou bid them rise and liveO itis fair playfools play by heaven Hectorhow now how nowfor the love of all the godslets leave the hermit pity with our mothersand when we have our armours buckled onthe venomed vengeance ride upon our swordsspur them to ruthful work rein them from ruthfie savage fiehector then itis warstroilus I would not have you fight to-daywho should withhold menot fate obedience nor the hand of Marsbeckoning with fiery truncheon my retirenot Priamus and Hecuba on kneestheir eyes oergalled with recourse of tearsnor you my brother with your true sword drawnopposed to hinder me should stop my waybut by my ruinlay hold upon him Priam hold him fasthe is thy crutch now if thou lose thy staythou on him leaning and all Troy on theefall all togethercome Hector come go backthy wife hath dreamed thy mother hath had visionscassandra doth foresee and I myselfam like a prophet suddenly enraptto tell thee that this day is ominoustherefore come backneas is a-fieldand I do stand engaged to many Greekseven in the faith of valour to appearthis morning to themay but thou shalt not goI must not break my faithyou know me dutiful therefore dear sirlet me not shame respect but give me leaveto take that course by your consent and voicewhich you do here forbid me royal PriamO Priam yield not to himdo not dear fatherandromache I am offended with youupon the love you bear me get you inthis foolish dreaming superstitious girlmakes all these bodementsO farewell dear Hectorlook how thou diest look how thy eye turns palelook how thy wounds do bleed at many ventshark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries outhow poor Andromache shrills her dolours forthbehold distraction frenzy and amazementlike witless anticks one another meetand all cry Hector Hectors dead O Hectoraway awayfarewell yet soft Hector I take my leavethou dost thyself and all our Troy deceiveyou are amazed my liege at her exclaimgo in and cheer the town well forth and fightdo deeds worth praise and tell you them at nightfarewell the gods with safety stand about theethey are at it hark proud Diomed believeI come to lose my arm or win my sleevedo you hear my lord do you hearwhat

leave you one ofthese days and I have a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were cursed I cannot tell what to think onit what says she therewords words mere words no matter from the heartthe effect doth operate another waygo wind to wind there turn and change togethermy love with words and errors still she feedsbut edifies another with her deedsnow they are clapper-clawing one another iull go look on that dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knaves sleeve of Troy there in his helm I would fain see them meet that that same young Trojan ass that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab on a sleeveless errand ofthe other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese Nestor and that same dog-fox Ulysses is not proved worth a blackberry they set me up in policy that mongrel cur Ajax against that dog of as bad a kind Achilles and now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles and will not arm to-day whereupon the Greans begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinion Soft here comes sleeve and'totherfly not for shouldst thou take the river StyxI would swim afterthou dost miscall retireI do not fly but advantageous carewithdrew me from the odds of multitudehave at theehold thy whore Grean now for thy whore Trojan now the sleeve now the sleevewhat art thou Greek art thou for Hectors matchart thou of blood and honourno no I am a rascal a

what you Willif music be the food of love play ongive me excess of it that surfeitingthe appetite may sicken and so diethat strain again it had a dying fallO it came oer my ear like the sweet soundthat breathes upon a bank of violetsstealing and giving odour Enough no moreitis not so sweet now as it was beforeO spirit of love how quick and fresh art thouthat notwithstanding thy capatyreceiveth as the sea nought enters thereof what validity and pitch soeerbut falls into abatement and low priceeven in a minute so full of shapes is fancythat it alone is high fantasticalwill you go hunt my lordwhat Curiothe hartwhy so I do the noblest that I haveO when mine eyes did see Olivia firstmethought she purged the air of pestilencethat instant was I turned into a hartand my desires like fell and cruel houndseer since pursue mehow now what news from herso please my lord I might not be admittedbut from her handmaid do return this answerthe element itself till seven years heatshall not behold her face at ample viewbut like a cloistress she will veiled walkand water once a day her chamber roundwith eve-offending brine all this to seasona brothers dead love which she would keep freshand lasting in her sad remembranceO she that hath a heart of that fine frameto pay this debt of love but to a brotherhow will she love when the rich golden shafthath killed the flock of all affections elsethat live in her when liver brain and heartthese sovereign thrones are all supplied and filledher sweet perfections with one self kingaway before me to sweet beds of flowerslove-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowerswhat country friends is thisthis is Illyria ladyand what should I do in Illyriamy brother he is in Elysiumperchance he is not drowned what think you sailorsit is perchance that you yourself were savedO my poor brother and so perchance may he betrue madam and to comfort you with chanceassure yourself after our ship did splitwhen you and those poor number saved with youhung on our driving boat I saw your brothermost provident in peril bind himselfcourage and hope both teaching him the practiceto a strong mast that lived upon the seawhere like Arion on the dolphins backI saw him hold acquaintance with the wavesso long as I could seefor saying so theres goldmine own escape unfoldeth to my hopewhereto thy speech serves for authoritythe like of him knowest thou this countryay madam well for I was bred and bornnot three hours travel from this very placewho governs herea noble duke in nature as in namewhat is his nameorsinoorsino I have heard my father name himhe was a bachelor thenand so is now or was so very latefor but a month ago I went from henceand then itwas fresh in murmur as you knowwhat great ones do the less will prattle ofthat he did seek the love of fair Oliviawhats shea virtuous maid the daughter of a countthat died some twelvemonth since then leaving herin the protection of his son her brotherwho shortly also died for whose dear lovethey say she hath abjured the companyand sight of menO that I served that ladyand might not be delivered to the worldtill I had made mine own occasion mellowwhat my estate isthat were hard to compassbecause she will admit no kind of suitno not the dukesthere is a fair behaviour in thee

master loves you O such lovecould be but recompensed though you were crownedthe nonpareil of beautyhow does he love mewith adorations with fertile tearswith groans that thunder love with sighs of fireyour lord does know my mind I cannot love himyet I suppose him virtuous know him nobleof great estate of fresh and stainless youthin voices well divulged free learned and valiantand in dimension and the shape of naturea gracious person but yet I cannot love himhe might have took his answer long agoif I did love you in my masters flamewith such a suffering such a deadly lifein your denial I would find no senseI would not understand itwhy what would youmake me a willow cabin at your gateand call upon my soul within the housewrite loyal cantons of contemned loveand sing them loud even in the dead of nightholla your name to the reverberate hillsand make the babbling gossip of the aircry out Olivia O you should not restbetween the elements of air and earthbut you

I feel this youths perfectionswith an invisible and subtle stealthto creep in at mine eyes well let it bewhat ho Malvoliohere madam at your servicerun after that same peevish messengerthe countys man he left this ring behind himwould I or not tell him iull none of itdesire him not to flatter with his lordnor hold him up with hopes im not for himif that the youth will come this way to-morrowiull give him reasons forit chide thee Malvoliomadam I willI do I know not what and fear to findmine eye too great a flatterer for my mindfate show thy force ourselves we do not owewhat is decreed must be and be this sowill you stay no longer nor will you not that I go with youby your patience no my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on youlet me yet know of you whither you are boundno sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy but I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the

publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair she is drowned already sir with salt water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with morepardon me sir your bad entertainmentO good Antonio forgive me your troubleif you will not murder me for my love let me be your servantif you will not undo what you have done that is kill him whom you have recovered desire it not fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me I am bound to the Count Orsinos court farewellthe gentleness of all the gods go with theeI have many enemies in Orsinos courtelse would I very shortly see thee therebut come what may I do adore thee sothat danger shall seem sport and I will gowere not you even now with the Countess Oliviaeven now sir on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hithershe returns this ring to you sir you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself she adds moreover that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him and one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lords taking of this receive it soshe took the ring of me iull none of itcome sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned if it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be it his that finds itI left no ring with her what means this ladyfortune forbid my outside have not charmed hershe made good view of me indeed so muchthat sure methought her eyes had lost her tonguefor she did speak in starts distractedlyshe loves me sure the cunning of her passioninvites me in this churlish messengernone of my lords ring why he sent her

know to be up late is to be up latea false conclusion I hate it as an unfilled can to be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes

patient for to-night since the youth of the counts was to-day with my lady she is much out of quiet for Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him if I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed I know I can do itpossess us possess us tell us something of himmarry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritanO if I thought that id beat him like a dogwhat for being a puritan thy exquisite reason dear knightI have no exquisite reason forit but I have reason good enoughthe devil a puritan that he is or anything constantly but a time-pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself so crammed as he thinks with excellences that it is his ground of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to workwhat wilt thou doI will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated I can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our handsexcellent I smell a deviceI havet in my nose toohe shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she is in love with himmy purpose is indeed a horse of that colourand your horse now would make him an assass I doubt notO itwill be admirablesport royal I warrant you I know my physic will work with him I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it for this night to bed and dream on the event farewellgood night Penthesileabefore me shes a good wenchshes a beagle true-bred and one that adores me what o thatI was adored once toolets to bed knight thou hadst need send for more moneyif I cannot recover your

now come knight come knightgive me some music now good morrow friendsnow good Cesario but that piece of songthat old and antique song we heard last nightmethought it did relieve my passion muchmore than light airs and recollected termsof these most brisk and giddy-paced timescome but one versehe is not here so please your lordship that should sing itwho was itfeste the jester my lord a fool that the Lady Olivias father took much delight in he is about the houseseek him out and play the tune the whilecome hither boy if ever thou shalt lovein the sweet pangs of it remember mefor such as I am all true lovers areunstaid and skittish in all motions elsesave in the constant image of the creaturethat is beloved how dost thou like this tuneit gives a very echo to the seatwhere love is thronedthou dost speak masterlymy life uponit young though thou art thine eyehath stayed upon some favour that it loveshath it not boya little by your favourwhat kind of woman isitof your complexionshe is not worth thee then what years infaithabout your years my lordtoo old by heaven let still the woman takean elder than herself so wears she to himso sways she level in her husbands heartfor boy however we do praise ourselvesour fanes are more giddy and unfirmmore longing wavering sooner lost and wornthan womens areI think it well my lordthen let thy love be younger than thyselfor thy affection cannot hold the bentfor women are as roses whose fair flowerbeing once displayed doth fall that very hourand so they are alas that they are soto die even when they to perfection growO fellow come the song we had last nightmark it Cesario it is old and plainthe spinsters and the knitters in the sunand the free maids that weave their thread with bonesdo use to chant it it is silly soothand dallies with the innocence of lovelike the old ageare you ready siray prithee singcome away come away deathand in sad cypress let me be laidfly away fly away breathI am slain by a fair cruel maidmy shroud of white stuck all with yewO prepare itmy part of death no one so truedid share itnot a flower not a flower sweeton my black coffin let there be strownnot a friend not a friend greetmy poor corse where my bones shall be throwna thousand thousand sighs to savelay me O wheresad true lover never find my graveto weep theretheres for thy painsno pains sir I take pleasure in singing siriull pay thy pleasure thentruly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or anothergive me now leave to leave theenow the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal I would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere for thats it that always makes a good voyage of nothing farewelllet all the rest give placeonce more Cesarioget thee to yond same sovereign crueltytell her my love more noble than the worldprizes not quantity of dirty landsthe parts that fortune hath bestowed upon hertell her I hold as giddily as fortunebut itis that miracle and queen of gemsthat nature pranks her in attracts my soulbut if she cannot love you sirI cannot be so answeredsooth but you mustsay that some lady as perhaps there ishath for your love as great a pang of heartas you have for Olivia you cannot love heryou tell her so must she not then be answeredthere is no womans sidescan bide the beating of so strong a passionas love doth give my heart no womans heartso big to hold so much they lack retentionalas their love may be called appetiteno motion of the liver but the palatethat suffer surfeit cloyment and revoltbut mine is all as hungry as the seaand can digest as much make no comparebetween that love a woman can bear meand that I owe Oliviaay but I knowwhat dost thou knowtoo well what love women to men may owein faith they are as true of heart as wemy father had a daughter loved a manas it might be perhaps were I a womanI should your lordshipand whats her historya blank my lord she never told her lovebut let concealment like a worm inthe budfeed on her damask cheek she pined in thoughtand with a green and yellow melancholyshe sat like Patience on a monumentsmiling at grief was not this love indeedwe men may say more swear more but indeedour shows are more than will for still we provemuch in our vows but little in our lovebut died thy sister of her love my boyI am all the daughters of my fathers houseand all the brothers too and yet I

him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him Close in the name of jesting Lie thou therefor here comes the trout that must be caught with ticklingitis but fortune all is fortune Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her what should I think onitheres an over-weening rogueO peace Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him how he jets under his advanced plumesslight I could so beat the roguepeace I sayto be Count Malvolioah roguepistol him pistol himpeace peacethere is example forit the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobefie on him JezebelO peace now hes deeply in look how imagination blows himhaving been three months married to her sitting in my stateO for a stone-bow to hit him in the eyecalling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a daybed where I have left Olivia sleepingfire and brimstoneO peace peaceand then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman Tobybolts and shacklesO peace peace peace now nowseven of my people with an obedient start make out for him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my some rich jewel Toby approaches curtsies there to meshall this fellow livethough our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peaceI extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of controland does not Toby take you a blow ofthe lips thensaying Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech what whatyou must amend your drunkenness out scabnay patience or we break the sinews of our plotbesides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight thats me I

formal capaty there is no obstruction in this and the end what should that alphabetical position portend if I could make that resemble something in me Softly M O a IO ay make up that he is now at a cold scentsowter will cry uponit for all this though it be as rank as a foxm Malvolio M why that begins my namedid not I say he would work it out the cur is excellent at faultsm but then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation a should follow but O doesand O shall end I hopeay or iull cudgel him and make him cry Oand then I comes behinday an you had any eye behind you you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before youm O a I this simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters

thrust upon them thy fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity she thus advises thee that sighs for thee Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered I say remember go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortunes fingers farewell she that would alter services with theedaylight and champian discovers not more this is open I will be proud I will read politic authors I will baffle sir Toby I will wash off gross acquaintance I will be point-devise the very man I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason extes to this that my lady loves me she did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross-gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking I thank my stars I am happy I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross-gartered even with the swiftness of putting on Jove and my stars be praised here is yet a postscriptthou canst not choose but know who I am if thou entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet I pritheejove I thank thee I will smile I will do everything that thou wilt have meI will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the SophyI could marry this wench for this deviceso could I tooand ask no other dowry with her but such another jestnor I neitherhere comes my noble gull-catcherwilt thou set thy foot o my neckor o mine eithershall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become thy bond-slaveinfaith or I eitherwhy thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run madnay but say true does it work upon himlike aqua-vitwith a midwifeif you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and itis a colour she abhors and cross-gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt if you will see it follow meto the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of witiull make one toosave thee friend and thy music dost thou live by thy taborno sir I live by the churchart thou a churchmanno such matter sir I do live by the church for I do live at my house and my house doth stand by the churchso thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the churchyou have said sir to see this agea sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the wrong side may be turned outwardnay thats certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wantonI would therefore my sister had had no name sirwhy manwhy sir her names a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton but indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced themthy reason mantroth sir I can yield you none without words and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with themI warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothingnot so sir I do care for something but in my consence sir I do not care for you if that be to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisibleart not thou the Lady Olivias foolno indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husbands the bigger I am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of wordsI saw

come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say element but the word is overwornthis fellows wise enough to play the fooland to do that well craves a kind of withe must observe their mood on whom he jeststhe quality of persons and the timeand like the haggard check at every featherthat comes before his eye this is a practiceas full of labour as a wise mans artfor folly that he wisely shows is fitbut wise men folly-falln quite taint their witsave you gentlemanand you sirdieu vous garde monsieuret vous aussI votre serviteurI hope sir you are and I am yourswill

cypress not a bosomhideth my heart so let me hear you speakI pity youthats a degree to loveno not a grize for itis a vulgar proofthat very oft we pity enemieswhy then methinks itis time to smile

not what I amI would you were as I would have you bewould it be better madam than I amI wish it might for now I am your foolO what a deal of scorn looks beautifulin the contempt and anger of his lipa murderous guilt shows not itself more soonthan love that would seem hid loves night is nooncesario by the roses of the springby maidhood honour truth and every thingI love thee so that maugre all thy pridenor wit nor reason can my passion hidedo not extort thy reasons from this clausefor that I woo thou therefore hast no causebut rather reason thus with reason fetterlove sought is good but givn unsought is betterby innocence I swear and by my youthI have one heart one bosom and one truthand that no woman has nor never noneshall mistress be of it save I aloneand so adieu good madam never morewill I my masters tears to you deploreyet come again for thou perhaps mayst movethat heart which now abhors to like his loveno faith iull not stay a jot longerthy reason dear

the while old boy tell me thatas plain as I see you nowthis was a great argument of love in her toward youslight will you make an ass o meI will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reasonand they have been grand-jurymen since before noah was a sailorshe did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness this was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icle on a Dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policyant be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politianwhy then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour challenge me the counts youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valourthere is no way but this sir Andrewwill either of you bear me a challenge to himgo write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention taunt him with the licence of ink if thou thouest him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England set em down go about it let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goose-pen no matter about itwhere shall I find youwell call thee at the cubiculo gothis is a dear manakin to you sir TobyI have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or sowe shall have a rare letter from him but youll not deliver itnever trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together for Andrew if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea iull eat the rest of the anatomyand his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of crueltylook where the youngest wren of nine comesif you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness Hes in yellow stockingsand cross-garteredmost villanously like a pedant that keeps a school inthe church I have dogged him like his murderer he does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him he does smile his face into more lines than are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies you have not seen such a thing as itis I can hardly forbear hurling things at him I know my lady will strike him if she do hell smile and taket for a great favourcome bring us bring us where he isI would not by my will have troubled youbut since you make your pleasure of your painsI will no further chide youI could not stay behind you my desiremore sharp than filed steel did spur me forthand not all love to see you though so muchas might have drawn one to a longer voyagebut jealousy what might befall your travelbeing skilless in these parts which to a strangerunguided and unfriended often proverough and unhospitable my willing lovethe rather by these arguments of fearset forth in your pursuitmy kind AntonioI can no other answer make but thanksand thanks and ever thanks for oft good turnsare shuffled off with such uncurrent paybut were

naturealbeit the quality of the time and quarrelmight well have given us bloody argumentit might have since been answered in repayingwhat we took from them which for traffics sakemost of our ty

him I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowryoh ho do you come near me now no worse man than sir Toby to look to me this concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him for she intes me to that in the letter Cast thy humble slough says she be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth I have limed her but it is Joves doing and Jove make me thankful and when she went away now let this fellow be looked to fellow not Malvolio nor after my degree but fellow why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe rcumstance what can be said nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be thankedwhich way is he in the name of sanctity if all the devils in hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possessed him yet iull speak to himhere he is here he is how isit with you

for more than iull sayhow now mistressO lordprithee hold thy peace this is not the way do you not see you move him let me alone with himno way but gentleness gently gently the fiend is rough and will not be roughly usedwhy how now my bawcock how dost thou chucksiray Biddy come with me what man itis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan hang him foul collierget him to say his prayers good sir Toby get him to praymy prayers minxno I warrant you he will not hear of godlinessgo hang yourselves all you are idle shallow things I am not of your element you shall know more hereafterisit possibleif this were played upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fictionhis very genius hath taken the infection of the device mannay pursue him now lest the device take air and taintwhy we shall make him mad indeedthe house will be the quietercome well have him in a dark room and bound my niece is already in the belief that hes mad we may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime tired out of breath prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen but see but seemore matter for a May morningheres the challenge read it I warrant theres vinegar and pepper initisit so saucyay isit I warrant him do but readgive me youth whatsoever thou art thou art but a scurvy fellowgood and valiantwonder not nor admire not in thy mind why I do call thee so for I will show thee no reason forita good note that keeps you from the blow of the lawthou comest to the Lady Olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter I challenge thee forvery brief and to exceeding good sense lessI will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill megoodthou killest me like a rogue and a villainstill you keep ofthe windy side of the law goodfare thee well and God have mercy upon one of our souls he may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better and so look to thyself thy friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemyif this letter move him not his legs cannotiull givet himyou may have very fit occasion for forit he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by departgo sir Andrew scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him awaynay let me alone for swearingnow will not I deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capaty and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole but sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as I know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatriceshere he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after himI will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challengeI have said too much unto a heart of stoneand laid mine honour too unchary outtheres something in me that reproves my faultbut such a headstrong potent fault it isthat it but mocks reproofwith the same haviour that your passion bearsgoes on my masters griefshere wear this jewel for me itis my picturerefuse it not it hath no tongue to vex youand I beseech you come again to-morrowwhat shall you ask of me that iull denythat honour saved may upon asking givenothing but this your true love for my masterhow with mine honour may I give him thatwhich I have given to youI will acquit youwell come again to-morrow fare thee wella fiend like thee might bear my soul to hellgentleman God save theeand you sirthat defence thou hast betake thee toit of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard-end Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skilful and deadlyyou mistake sir I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any manyoull find it otherwise I assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withalI pray you sir what is hehe is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre Hob nob is his word givet or taketI will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady I am no fighter I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirksir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must thats certain or forswear to wear iron about youthis is as unvil as strange I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purposeI will do so Signior fabian stay you by this gentleman till my returnpray you sir do you know of this matterI know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the rcumstance moreI beseech you what manner of man is henothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour he is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria Will you walk towards him I will make your peace with him if I canI shall be much bound to you forit I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight I care not who knows so much of my mettlewhy man hes a very devil I have not seen such a firago I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on they say he has been fencer to the Sophypox onit iull not meddle with himay but he will not now be pafied fabian can scarce hold him yonderplague onit an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence id have seen him damned ere id have challenged him let him let the matter slip and iull give him my horse grey Capiletiull make the motion Stand here make a good show onit this shall end without the perdition of soulsmarry iull ride your horse as well as I ride youI have his horse to take up the quarrel I have persuaded him the youths a devilhe is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heelstheres no remedy sir he will fight with you for his oaths sake Marry he hath better bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he will not hurt youpray God defend me a little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a mangive ground if you see him furiouscome sir Andrew theres no remedy the gentleman will for his honours sake have one bout with you he cannot by the duello avoid it but he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you come on toitpray God he keep his oathI do assure you itis against my willput up your sword if this young gentlemanhave done offence I take the fault on meif you offend him I for him defy youyou sir why what are youone sir that for his love dares yet do morethan you have heard him brag to you he willnay if you be an undertaker I am for youO good sir Toby hold here come the officersiull be with you anonpray sir put your sword up if you pleasemarry will I sir and for that I promised you iull be as good as my word he will bear you easily and reins wellthis is the man do thy officeantonio I arrest thee at the suitof Count Orsinoyou do mistake me sirno sir no jot I know your favour wellthough now you have no sea-cap on your headtake him away he knows I know him wellI must obeythis comes with seeking youbut theres no remedy I shall answer itwhat will you do now my necessitymakes me to ask you for my purse it grieves memuch more for what I cannot do for youthan what befalls myself you stand amazedbut be of comfortcome sir awayI must entreat of you some of that moneywhat money sirfor the fair kindness you have showed me hereand part being prompted by your present troubleout of my lean and low abilityiull lend you something my having is not muchiull make division of my present with youhold there is half my

sakedid I expose myself pure for his loveinto the danger of this adverse towndrew to defend him when he was besetwhere being apprehended his false cunningnot meaning to partake with me in dangertaught him to face me out of his acquaintanceand grew a twenty years removed thingwhile one would wink denied me mine own pursewhich I had recommended to his usenot half an hour beforehow can this bewhen came he to this townto-day my lord and for three months beforeno interim not a minutes vacancyboth day and night did we keep companyhere comes the countess now heaven walks on

offerings hath breathed outthat eer devotion tendered what shall I doeven what it please my lord that shall become himwhy should I not had I the heart to do itlike to the Egyptian thief at point

must have done no less with wit and safetyyou throw a strange regard upon me and by thatI do perceive it hath offended youpardon me sweet one even for the vowswe made each other but so late agoone face one voice one habit and two personsa natural perspective that is and is notantonio O my dear Antoniohow have the hours racked and tortured mesince I have lost theesebastian are youfearest thou that Antoniohow have you made division of yourselfan apple cleft in two is not more twinthan these two creatures Which is Sebastianmost wonderfuldo I stand there I never had a brothernor can there be that deity in my natureof here and every where I had a sisterwhom the blind waves and surges have devouredof charity what kin are you to mewhat countryman what name what parentageof Messaline Sebastian was my fathersuch a Sebastian was my brother tooso went he suited to his watery tombif spirits can assume both form and suityou come to fright usa spirit I am indeedbut am in that dimension grossly cladwhich from the womb I did partipatewere you a woman as the rest goes evenI should my tears let fall upon your cheekand say Thrice welcome drowned Viola my father had a mole upon his browand so had mineand died that day when Viola from her birthhad numbered thirteen yearsO that record is lively in my soulhe finished indeed his mortal actthat day that made my sister thirteen yearsif nothing lets to make us happy bothbut this my masculine usurped attiredo not embrace me till each rcumstanceof place time fortune do cohere and jumpthat I am Viola which to confirmiull bring you to a captain in this townwhere lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle helpI was preserved to serve this noble countall the occurrence of my fortune sincehath been between this lady and this lordso comes it lady you have been mistookbut nature to her bias drew in thatyou would have been contracted to a maidnor are you therein by my life deceivedyou are betrothed both to a maid and manbe not amazed right noble is his bloodif this be so as yet the glass seems trueI shall have share in this most happy wrackboy thou hast said to me a thousand timesthou never shouldst love woman like to meand all those sayings will I over-swearand all those swearings keep as true in soulas doth that orbed continent the firethat severs day from nightgive me thy handand let me see thee in thy womans weedsthe captain that did bring me first on shorehath my maids garments he upon some actionis now in durance at Malvolios suita gentleman and follower of my ladyshe shall enlarge him fetch Malvolio hitherand yet alas now I remember methey say poor gentleman hes much distracta most extracting frenzy of mine ownfrom my remembrance clearly banished hishow does he sirrahtruly madam he holds Belzebub at the staves end as well as a man in his case may do he has here writ a letter to you I should have given it to you to-day morning but as a madmans epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are deliveredopen it and read itlook then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madmanby the lord madamhow now art thou madno madam I do but read madness an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow voxprithee read inthy right witsso I do madonna but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my princess and give earread it you sirrahby the lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame think of me as you please I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injurydid he write thisay madamthis savours not much of distractionsee him delivered fabian bring him hithermy lord so please you these things further thought onto think me as well a sister as a wifeone day shall crown the alliance onit so please youhere at my house and at my proper costmadam I am most apt to embrace your offeryour master quits you and for your service done himso much against the mettle of your sexso far beneath your soft and tender breedingand since you called me master for so longhere is my hand you shall from this time beyour masters mistressa sister you are sheis this the madmanay my lord this samehow now Malvoliomadam you have done me wrongnotorious wronghave I Malvolio nolady you have pray you peruse that letteryou must not now deny it is your handwrite from it if you can in hand or phraseor say itis not your seal nor your inventionyou can say none of this well grant it thenand tell me in the modesty of honourwhy you have given me such clear lights of favourbade me come smiling and cross-gartered to youto put on yellow stockings and to frownupon sir Toby and the lighter peopleand acting this in an obedient hopewhy have you suffered me to be imprisonedkept in a dark house visited by the priestand made the most notorious geck and gullthat eer invention played on tell me whyalas Malvolio this is not my writingthough I confess much like the characterbut out of question itis Marias handand now I do bethink me it was shefirst told me thou wast mad then camest in smilingand in such forms which here were presupposedupon thee in the letter Prithee be contentthis practice hath most shrewdly passed upon theebut when we know the grounds and authors of itthou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judgeof thine own causegood madam hear me speakand let no quarrel nor no brawl to cometaint the condition of this present hourwhich I have wondered at in hope it shall notmost freely I confess myself and Tobyset this device against Malvolio hereupon some stubborn and uncourteous partswe had conceived against him Maria writthe letter at sir Tobys great importancein recompense whereof he hath married herhow with a sportful malice it was followedmay rather pluck on laughter than revengeif that the injuries be justly weighedthat have on both sides pastalas poor fool how have they baffled theewhy some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them I was one sir in this interlude one sir Topas sir but thats all one by the lord fool I am not mad but do you remember madam why laugh you at such a barren rascal an you smile not hes gagged and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges iull be revenged on the whole pack of youhe hath been most notoriously abusedpursue him and entreat him to a peacehe hath not told us of the captain yetwhen that is known and golden time conventsa solemn combination shall be madeof our dear souls Meantime sweet sisterwe will not part from hence Cesario comefor so you shall be while you are a manbut when in other habits you are seenorsinos mistress and his fancys queenwhen that I was and a little tiny boywith hey ho the wind and the raina foolish thing was but a toyfor the rain it raineth every daybut when I came to mans estatewith hey ho the wind and the raingainst knaves and thieves men shut their gatesfor the rain it raineth every daybut when I came alas to wivewith hey ho the wind and the rainby swaggering could I never thrivefor the rain it raineth every daybut when I came unto my bedswith hey ho the wind and the rainwith toss-pots still had drunken headsfor the rain it raineth every daya great while ago the world begunwith hey ho the wind and the rainbut thats all one our play is doneand well strive to please you every dayI come no more to make you laugh things nowthat bear a weighty and a serious browsad high and working full of state and woesuch noble scenes as draw the eye to flowwe now present those that can pity heremay if they think it well let fall a tearthe subject will deserve it such as givetheir money out of hope they may believemay here find truth too those that come to seeonly a show or two and so agreethe play may pass if they be still and willingiull undertake may see away their shillingrichly in two short hours Only theythat come to hear a merry bawdy playa noise of targets or to see a fellowin a long molley coat guarded with yellowwill be deceived for gentle hearers knowto rank our chosen truth with such a showas fool and fight is besides forfeitingour own brains and the opinion that we bringto make that only true we now intendwill leave us never an understanding friendtherefore for goodness sake and as you are knownthe first and happiest hearers of the townbe sad as we would make ye think ye seethe very persons of our noble storyas they were living think you see them greatand followed with the general throng and sweatof thousand friends then in a moment seehow soon this mightiness meets miseryand if you can be merry then iull saya man may weep upon his wedding daygood morrow and well met how have you donesince last we saw in FranceI thank your gracehealthful and ever since a fresh admirerof what I saw therean untimely aguestayed me a prisoner in my chamber whenthose suns of glory those two lights of menmet in the vale of Andrenbtwixt guynes and ArdeI was then present saw them salute on horsebackbeheld them when they lighted how they clungin their embracement as they grew togetherwhich had they what four throned ones could have weighedsuch a compounded oneall the whole timeI was my chambers prisonerthen you lostthe view of earthly glory men might saytill this time pomp was single but now marriedto one above itself Each following daybecame the next days master till the lastmade former wonders its to-day the Frenchall clinquant all in gold like heathen godsshone down the English and to-morrow theymade Britain India every man that stoodshowed like a mine Their dwarfish pages wereas cherubins all gilt the madams toonot used to toil did almost sweat to bearthe pride upon them that their very labourwas to them as a painting now this masquewas cried incomparable and the ensuing nightmade it a fool and beggar the two kingsequal in lustre were now best now worstas presence did present them him in eyestill him in praise and being present bothitwas said they saw but one and no discernerdurst wag his tongue in censure when these sunsfor so they phrase em by their heralds challengedthe noble spirits to arms they did performbeyond thoughts compass that former fabulous storybeing now seen possible enough got creditthat Bevis was believedO you go faras I belong to worship and affectin honour honesty the tract of every thingwould by a good discourser lose some lifewhich actions self was tongue to All was royalto the disposing of it nought rebelledorder gave each thing view the office diddistinctly his full functionwho did guideI mean who set the body and the limbsof this great sport together as you guessone certes that promises no elementin such a businessI pray you who my lordall this was ordered by the good discretionof the right reverend Cardinal of Yorkthe devil speed him no mans pie is freedfrom his ambitious finger what had heto do in these fierce vanities I wonderthat such a keech can with his very bulktake up the rays ofthe benefial sunand keep it from the earthsurely sirtheres in him stuff that puts him to these endsfor being not propped by ancestry whose gracechalks successors their way nor called uponfor high feats done to the crown neither alliedto eminent assistants but spider-likeout of his self-drawing web he gives us notethe force of his own merit makes his waya gift that heaven gives for him which buysa place next to the kingI cannot tellwhat heaven hath given him let some graver eyepierce into that but I can see his pridepeep through each part of him whence has he thatif not from hell the devil is a niggardor has given all before and he beginsa new hell in himselfwhy the devilupon this French going-out took he upon himwithout the privity ofthe king to appointwho should attend on him he makes up the fileof all the gentry for the most part suchto whom as great a charge as little honourhe meant to lay upon and his own letterthe honourable board of counseloutmust fetch him in he papersI do knowkinsmen of mine three at the least that haveby this so sickened their estates that neverthey shall abound as formerlyO manyhave broke their backs with laying manors on emfor this great journey what did this vanitybut minister communication ofa most poor issuegrievingly I thinkthe peace between the French and us not valuesthe cost that did conclude itevery manafter the hideous storm that followed wasa thing inspired and not consulting brokeinto a general prophecy that this tempestdashing the garment of this peace abodedthe sudden breach onitwhich is budded outfor France hath flawed the league and hath attachedour merchants goods at Bourdeauxis it thereforethe ambassador is silencedmarry isita proper title of a peace and purchasedat a superfluous ratewhy all this businessour reverend cardinal carriedlike it your gracethe state takes notice of the private differencebetwixt you and the cardinal I advise youand take it from a heart that wishes towards youhonour and plenteous safety that you readthe cardinals malice and his potencytogether to consider further thatwhat his high hatred would effect wants nota minister in his power you know his naturethat hes revengeful and I know his swordhath a sharp edge its long and'tmay be saidit reaches far and where itwill not extendthither he darts it Bosom up my counselyoull find it wholesome Lo where comes that rockthat I advise your shunningthe duke of Buckinghams surveyor hawheres his examinationhere so please youis he in person readyay please your gracewell we shall then know more and Buckinghamshall lessen this big lookthis butchers cur is venom-mouthed and Ihave not the power to muzzle him therefore bestnot wake him in his slumber a beggars bookoutworths a nobles bloodwhat are you chafedask God for temperance thats the appliance onlywhich your disease requiresI read ins looksmatter against me and his eye reviledme as his abject object at this instanthe bores me with some trick hes gone to the kingiull follow and out-stare himstay my lordand let your reason with your choler questionwhat itis you go about to climb steep hillsrequires slow pace at first anger is likea full-hot horse who being allowed his wayself-mettle tires him not a man in Englandcan advise me like you be to yourselfas you would to your friendiull to the kingand from a mouth of honour quite cry downthis Ipswich fellows

make my vouch as strongas shore of rock Attend this holy foxor wolf or both for he is equal ravenousas he is subtle and as prone to mischiefas able to perform'this mind and placeinfecting one another yea reprocallyonly to show his pomp as well in Franceas here at home suggests the king our masterto this last costly treaty the interviewthat swallowed so much treasure and like a glassdid break inthe rinsingfaith and so it didpraygive me favour sir this cunning cardinalthe articles ofthe combination drewas himself pleased and they were ratifiedas he cried thus let be to as much endas give a crutch to the dead but our count-cardinalhas done this and itis well for worthy Wolseywho cannot err he did it now this followswhich as I take it is a kind of puppyto the old dam treason Charles the emperorunder pretence to see the queen his auntfor itwas indeed his colour but he cameto whisper Wolsey here makes visitationhis fears were that the interview betwixtengland and France might through their amitybreed him some prejudice for from this leaguepeeped harms that menaced him he privilydeals with our cardinal and as I trowwhich I do well for I am sure the emperorpaid ere he promised whereby his suit was grantedere it was asked but when the way was madeand paved with gold the emperor thus desiredthat he would please to alter the kings courseand break the foresaid peace let the king knowas soon he shall by me that thus the cardinaldoes buy and sell his honour as he pleasesand for his own advantageI am sorryto hear this of him and could wish he weresomething mistaken initno not a syllableI do pronounce him in that very shapehe shall appear in proofyour office sergeant execute itsirmy lord the duke of Buckingham and

honour northe dignity of your office is the pointof my petitionlady mine proceedI am solited not by a fewand those of true condition that your subjectsare in great grievance there have been commissionssent down among em which hath flawed the heartof all their loyalties wherein althoughmy good lord Cardinal they vent reproachesmost bitterly on you as putter-onof these exactions yet the king our masterwhose honour heaven shield from soil even he escapes notlanguage unmannerly yea such which breaksthe sides of loyalty and almost appearsin loud rebellionnot almost appearsit doth appear for upon these taxationsthe clothiers all not able to maintainthe many to them longing have put offthe spinsters carders fullers weavers whounfit for other life compelled by hungerand lack of other means in desperate mannerdaring the event to the teeth are all in uproarand danger serves among themtaxationwherein and what taxation my lord Cardinalyou that are blamed for it alike with usknow you of this taxationplease you sirI know but of a single part in aughtpertains to the state and front but in that filewhere others tell steps with meno my lordyou know no more than others but you framethings that are known alike which are not wholesometo those which would not know them and yet mustperforce be their acquaintance these exactionswhereof my sovreign would have note they aremost pestilent to the hearing and to bear emthe back is sacrifice to the load they saythey are devised by you or else you suffertoo hard an exclamationstill exactionthe nature of it in what kind lets knowis this exactionI am much too venturousin tempting of your patience but am boldenedunder your promised pardon the subjects griefcomes through commissions which compel from eachthe sixth part of his substance to be leviedwithout delay and the pretence for thisis named your wars in France this makes bold mouthstongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freezeallegiance in them their curses nowlive where their prayers did and its come to passthis tractable obedience is a slaveto each incensed will I would your highnesswould give it quick consideration forthere is no primer businessby my lifethis is against our pleasureand for meI have no further gone in this than bya single voice and that not passed me butby learned approbation of the judges if I amtraduced by ignorant tongues which neither knowmy faculties nor person yet will bethe chronicles of my doing let me sayitis but the fate of place and the rough brakethat virtue must go through we must not stintour necessary actions in the fearto cope malious censurers which everas ravnous fishes do a vessel followthat is new-trimmed but benefit no furtherthan vainly longing what we oft do bestby sick interpreters once weak ones isnot ours or not allowed what worst as ofthitting a grosser quality is cried upfor our best act if we shall stand stillin fear our motion will be mocked or carped atwe should take root here where we sit or sitstate-statues onlythings done welland with a care exempt themselves from fearthings done without example in their issueare to be feared have you a precedentof this commission I believe not anywe must not rend our subjects from our lawsand stick them in our will Sixth part of eacha trembling contribution why we takefrom every tree lop bark and part ofthe timberand though we leave it with a root thus hackedthe air will drink the sap to every countywhere this is questioned send our letters withfree pardon to each man that has deniedthe force of this commission pray look to tI put it to your carea word with youlet there be letters writ to every shireof the kings grace and pardon the grieved commonshardly conceive of me let it be noisedthat through our intercession this revokementand pardon comes I shall anon advise youfurther in the proceedingI am sorry that the duke of Buckinghamis run in your displeasureit grieves manythe gentleman is learned and a most rare speakerto nature none more bound his training suchthat he may furnish and instruct great teachersand never seek for aid out of himself yet seewhen these so noble benefits shall provenot well disposed the mind growing once corruptthey turn to vious forms ten times more uglythan ever they were fair this man so completewho was enrolled mongst wonders and when wealmost with ravished listening could not findhis hour of speech a minute he my ladyhath into monstrous habits put the gracesthat once were his and is become as blackas if besmeared in hell Sit by us you shall hearthis was his gentleman in trust of himthings to strike honour sad Bid him recountthe fore-reted practices whereofwe cannot feel too little hear too muchstand forth and with bold spirit relate what youmost like a careful subject have collectedout of the duke of Buckinghamspeak freelyfirst it was usual with him every dayit would infect his speech that if the kingshould without issue die heed carry it soto make the sceptre his these very wordsive heard him utter to his son-in-lawlord Abergavenny to whom by oath he menacedrevenge upon the cardinalplease your highness notethis dangerous conception in this pointnot friended by his wish to your high personhis will is most malignant and it stretchesbeyond you to your friendsmy learned lord Cardinaldeliver all with charityspeak onhow grounded he his title to the crownupon our fail to this point hast thou heard himat any time speak aughthe was brought to thisby a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkinswhat was that Hopkinssir a Chartreux friarhis confessor who fed him every minutewith words of sovereigntyhow knowest thou thisnot long before your highness sped to Francethe duke being at the Rose within the parishsaint Lawrence Poultney did of me demandwhat was the speech among the Londonersconcerning the French journey I repliedmen feared the French would prove perfidiousto the kings danger presently the dukesaid itwas the fear indeed and that he doubtedtwould prove the verity of certain wordsspoke by a holy monk that oft says hehath sent to me wishing me to permitjohn de la Car my chaplain a choice hourto hear from him a matter of some momentwhom after under the confessions sealhe solemnly had sworn that what he spokemy chaplain to no creature living butto me should utter with demure confidencethis pausingly ensued neither the king nor s heirstell you the duke shall prosper bid him striveto gain the love ofthe commonalty the dukeshall govern England if I know you wellyou were the dukes surveyor and lost your officeon the complaint ofthe tenants take good heedyou charge not in your spleen a noble personand spoil your nobler soul I say take heedyes heartily beseech youlet him ongo forwardon my soul iull speak but truthI told my lord the duke by the devils illusionsthe monk might be deceived and that itwas dangerous for himto ruminate on this so far untilit forged him some design which being believedit was much like to do he answered Tushit can do me no damage adding furtherthat had the king in his last sickness failedthe cardinals and sir Thomas lovells headsshould have gone offha what so rank ah hatheres mischief in this man Canst thou say furtherI can my liegeproceedbeing at Greenwichafter your highness had reproved the dukeabout sir William BlomerI rememberof such a time being my sworn servantthe duke retained him his but on what henceif quoth he I for this had been committedas to the Tower I thought I would have playedthe part my father meant to act uponthe usurper Richard who being at Salisburymade suit to come in s presence which if grantedas he made semblance of his duty wouldhave put his knife into him a giant traitornow madam may his highness live in freedomand this man out of prisongod mend alltheres something more would out of thee what saystafter the duke his father with the knife he stretched him and with one hand on his daggeranother spread ons breast mounting his eyeshe did discharge a horrible oath whose tenourwas were he evil used he would outgohis father by as much as a performancedoes an irresolute purposetheres his periodto sheathe his knife in us he is attachedcall him to present trial if he mayfind mercy in the law itis his if nonelet him not seekt of us by day and nighthes traitor to the heightisit possible the spells of France should jugglemen into such strange mysteriesnew customsthough they be never so ridiculousnay let em be unmanly yet are followedas far as I see all the good our Englishhave got by the late voyage is but merelya fit or two ofthe face but they are shrewd onesfor when they hold em you would swear directlytheir very noses had been counsellorsto Pepin or Clotharius they keep state sothey have all new legs and lame ones one would take itthat never saw em pace before the spavinor springhalt reigned among emdeath my lordtheir clothes are after such a pagan cut toothat sure theyve worn out Christendomhow nowwhat news sir Thomas lovellfaith my lordI hear of none but the new proclamationthats clapped upon the court-gatewhat isit forthe reformation of our travelled gallantsthat fill the court with quarrels talk and tailorsI am glad itis there now I would pray our monsieursto think an English courtier may be wiseand never see the Louvrethey must eitherfor so run the conditions leave those remnantsof fool and feather that they got in Francewith all their honourable points of ignorancepertaining thereunto as fights and fireworksabusing better men than they can beout of a foreign wisdom renounng cleanthe faith they have in tennis and tall stockingsshort blistered breeches and those types of traveland understand again like honest menor pack to their old playfellows there I take itthey may cum privilegio wear awaythe lag end of their lewdness and be laughed atitis time to give em physic their diseasesare grown so catchingwhat a loss our ladieswill have of these trim vanitiesay marrythere will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresonshave got a speeding trick to lay down ladiesa French song and a fiddle has

favour let the music knock itwhither away so fastO God save yeeen to the hall to hear what shall becomeof the great duke of Buckinghamiull save youthat labour sir Alls now done but the ceremonyof bringing back the prisonerwere you thereyes indeed was Ipray speak what has happenedyou may guess quickly whatis he found guiltyyes truly is he and condemned uponitI am sorry foritso are a number morebut pray how passed itiull tell you in a little the great dukecame to the bar where to his accusationshe pleaded still not guilty and allegedmany sharp reasons to defeat the lawthe kings attorney on the contraryurged on the examinations proofs confessionsof divers witnesses which the duke desiredto have brought vivvoce to his faceat which appeared against him his surveyorsir gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Carconfessor to him with that devil-monkhopkins that made this mischiefthat was hethat fed him with his propheesthe sameall these accused him strongly which he fainwould have flung from him but indeed he could notand so his peers upon this evidencehave found him guilty of high treason Muchhe spoke and learnedly for life but allwas either pitied in him or forgottenafter all this how did he bear himselfwhen he was brought again to the bar to hearhis knell rung out his judgment he was stirredwith such an agony he sweat extremelyand something spoke in choler ill and hastybut he fell to himself again and sweetlyin all the rest showed a most noble patienceI do not think he fears deathsure he does nothe never was so womanish the causehe may a little grieve atcertainlythe cardinal is the end of thisitis likelyby all conjectures first Kildares attainderthen deputy of Ireland who removedearl Surrey was sent thither and in haste toolest he should help his fatherthat trick of statewas a deep envious oneat his returnno doubt he will requite it this is notedand generally whoever the king favoursthe cardinal instantly will find employmentand far enough from court tooall the commonshate him perniously and o my consencewish him ten fathom deep this duke as muchthey love and dote on call him bounteous Buckinghamthe mirror of all courtesystay there sirand see the noble ruined man you speak oflets stand close and behold himall good peopleyou that thus far have come to pity mehear what I say and then go home and lose meI have this day received a traitors judgmentand by that name must die yet heaven bear witnessand if I have a consence let it sink meeven as the axe falls if I be not faithfulthe law I bear no malice for my deatht has done upon the premises but justicebut those that sought it I could wish more christiansbe what they will I heartily forgive emyet let em look they glory not in mischiefnor build their evils on the graves of great menfor then my guiltless blood must cry against emfor further life in this world I neer hopenor will I sue although the king have meresmore than I dare make faults you few that loved meand dare be bold to weep for Buckinghamhis noble friends and fellows whom to leaveis only bitter to him only dyinggo with me like good angels to my endand as the long divorce of steel falls on memake of your prayers one sweet sacrificeand lift my soul to heaven Lead on o Gods nameI do beseech your grace for charityif ever any malice in your heartwere hid against me now to forgive me franklysir Thomas lovell I as free forgive youas I would be forgiven I forgive allthere cannot be those numberless offencesgainst me that I cannot take peace with no black envyshall mark my grave commend me to his graceand if he speak of Buckingham pray tell himyou met him half in heaven my vows and prayersyet are the kings and till my soul forsakeshall cry for blessings on him may he livelonger than I have time to tell his yearsever beloved and loving may his rule beand when old time shall lead him to his endgoodness and he fill up one monumentto the water side I must conduct your gracethen give my charge up to sir Nicholas Vauxwho undertakes you to your endprepare therethe duke is coming see the barge be readyand fit it with such furniture as suitsthe greatness of his personnay sir Nicholaslet it alone my state now will but mock mewhen I came hither I was lord high Constableand duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohunyet I am richer than my base accusersthat never knew what truth meant I now seal itand with that blood will make them one day groan foritmy noble father Henry of Buckinghamwho first raised head against usurping Richardflying for succour to his servant Banisterbeing distressed was by that wretch betrayedand without trial fell Gods peace be with himhenry the Seventh succeeding truly pityingmy fathers loss like a most royal princerestored me to my honours and out of ruinsmade my name once more noble now his sonhenry the Eighth life honour name and allthat made me happy at one stroke has takenfor ever from the world I had my trialand must needs say a noble one which makes mea little happier than my wretched fatheryet thus far we are one in fortunes bothfell by our servants by those men weloved mosta most unnatural and faithless serviceheaven has an end in all yet you that hear methis from a dying man receive as certainwhere you are liberal of your loves and counselsbe sure you be not loose for those you make friendsand give your hearts to when they once perceivethe least rub in your fortunes fall awaylike water from ye never found againbut where they mean to sink ye All good peoplepray for me I must now forsake ye the last hourof my long weary life is come upon mefarewelland when you would say something that is sadspeak how I fell I have done and God forgive meO this is full of pity sir it callsI fear too many curses on their headsthat were the authorsif the duke be guiltlessitis full of woe yet I can give you inklingof an ensuing evil if it fallgreater than thisgood angels keep it from uswhat may it be you do not doubt my faith sirthis secret is so weighty itwill requirea strong faith to conceal itlet me have itI do not talk muchI am confidentyou shall sir did you not of late days heara buzzing of a separationbetween the king and Katharineyes but it held notfor when the king once heard it out of angerhe sent command to the lord mayor straightto stop the rumour and allay those tonguesthat durst disperse itbut that slander siris found a truth now for it grows againfresher than eer it was and held for certainthe king will venture at it Either the cardinalor some about him near have out of maliceto the good queen possessed him with a scruplethat will undo her to confirm this toocardinal Campeius is arrived and latelyas all think for this businessitis the cardinaland merely to revenge him on the emperorfor not bestowing on him at his askingthe archbishopric of Toledo this is purposedI think you have hit the mark but isit not cruelthat she should feel the smart of this the cardinalwill have his will and she must fallitis woefulwe are too open here to argue thislets think in private moremy lord the horses your lordship sent for with all the care I had I saw well chosen ridden and furnished they were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north when they were ready to set out for London a man of my lord Cardinals by commission and main power took them from me with this reason his master would be served before a subject if not before the king which stopped our mouths sirI fear he will indeed well let him have themhe will have all I thinkwell met my lord Chamberlaingood day to both your graceshow is the king employedI left him privatefull of sad thoughts and troubleswhats the causeit seems the marriage with his brothers wifehas crept too near his consenceno his consencehas crept too near another ladyitis sothis is the cardinals doing the king-cardinalthat blind priest like the eldest son of fortuneturns what he list the king will know him one daypray God he do hell never know himself elsehow holily he works in all his businessand with what zeal for now he has cracked the leaguebetween us and the emperor the queens great nephewhe dives into the kings soul and there scattersdangers doubts wringing of the consencefears and despairs and all these for his marriageand out of all these to restore the kinghe counsels a divorce a loss of herthat like a jewel has hung twenty yearsabout his neck yet never lost her lustreof her that loves him with that excellencethat angels love good men with even of herthat when the greatest stroke of fortune fallswill bless the king and is not this course piousheaven keep me from such counsel itis most truethese news are every where every tongue speaks emand every true heart weeps forit All that darelook into these affairs see this main endthe French kings sister Heaven will one day openthe kings eyes that so long have slept uponthis bold bad manand free us from his slaverywe had need prayand heartily for our deliveranceor this imperious man will work us allfrom princes into pages All mens honourslie like one lump before him to be fashionedinto what pitch he pleasefor me my lordsI love him not nor fear him theres my creedas I am made without him so iull standif the king please his curses and his blessingstouch me alike theyre breath I not believe inI knew him and I know him so I leave himto him that made him proud the popelets inand with some other business put the kingfrom these sad thoughts that work too much upon himmy lord youll bear us companyexcuse methe king hath sent me otherwhere besidesyoull find a most unfit time to disturb himhealth to your lordshipsthanks my good lord Chamberlainhow sad he looks sure he is much afflictedwho is there hapray God he be not angrywhos there I say how dare you thrust yourselvesinto my private meditationswho am I haa gracious king that pardons all offencesmalice neer meant our breach of duty this wayis business of estate in which we cometo know your royal pleasureye are too boldgo to iull make ye know your times of businessis this an hour for temporal affairs hawhos there my good lord Cardinal O my Wolseythe quiet of my wounded consencethou art a cure fit for a kingyoure welcomemost learned reverend sir into our kingdomuse us and itmy good

scruple to the voice of Christendomwho can be angry now what envy reach youthe Spaniard tied by blood and favour to hermust now confess if they have any goodnessthe trial just and noble All the clerksI mean the learned ones in christian kingdomshave their free voices Rome the nurse of judgmentinvited by your noble self hath sentone general tongue unto us this good manthis just and learned priest Cardinal Campeiuswhom once more I present unto your highnessand once more in my arms I bid him welcomeand thank the holy conclave for their lovesthey have sent me such a man I would have wished foryour grace must needs deserve all strangers lovesyou are so noble to your highness handI tender my commission by whose virtuethe court of Rome commanding you my lordcardinal of York are joined with me their servantin the impartial judging of this businesstwo equal men the queen shall be acquaintedforthwith for what you come wheres gardinerI know your majesty has always

judgment ferdinandmy father king of Spain was reckoned onethe wisest prince that there had reigned by manya year before it is not to be questionedthat they had gathered a wise counselto themof every realm that did debate this businesswho deemed our marriage lawful wherefore I humblybeseech you sir to spare me till I maybe by my friends in Spain advised whose counselI will implore if not inthe name of Godyour pleasure be fulfilledyou have here ladyand of your choice these reverend fathers menof singular integrity and learningyea the elect ofthe land who are assembledto plead

I say againI utterly abhor yea from my soulrefuse you for my judge whom yet once moreI hold my most malious foe and think notat all a friend to truthI do professyou speak not like yourself who ever yethave stood to charity and displayed the effectsof disposition gentle and of wisdomoertopping womans power madam you do me wrongI have no spleen against you nor injusticefor you or any how far I have proceededor how far further shall is warrantedby a commission from the consistoryyea the whole consistory of Rome you charge methat I have blown this coal I do deny itthe king is present if it be known to himthat I gainsay my deed how may he woundand worthily my falsehood yea as muchas you have done my truth if he knowthat I am free of your report he knowsI am not of your wrong therefore in himit lies to cure me and the cure is toremove these thoughts from you the which beforehis highness shall speak in I do beseechyou gracious madam to unthink your speakingand to say so no moremy lord my lordI am a simple woman much too weakto oppose your cunning youre meek and humble-mouthedyou sign your place and calling in full seemingwith meekness and humility but your heartis crammed with arrogancy spleen and prideyou have by fortune and his highness favoursgone slightly oer low steps and now are mountedwhere powers are your retainers and your wordsdomestics to you serve your will ast pleaseyourself pronounce their office I must tell youyou tender more your persons honour thanyour high profession spiritual that againI do refuse you for my judge and herebefore you all appeal unto the popeto bring my whole cause fore his holinessand to be judged by himthe queen is obstinatestubborn to justice apt to accuse it anddisdainful to be tried byt itis not wellshes going awaycall her againkatharine queen of England come into the courtmadam you are called backwhat need you note it pray you keep your waywhen you are called return now the lord helpthey vex me past my patience pray you pass onI will not tarry no nor ever moreupon this business my appearance makein any of their courtsgo thy ways Katethat man inthe world who shall report he hasa better wife let him in nought be trustedfor speaking false in that thou art aloneif thy rare qualities sweet gentlenessthy meekness saint-like wife-like governmentobeying in commanding and thy partssovereign and pious else could speak thee outthe queen of earthly queens Shes noble bornand like her true nobility she hascarried herself towards memost gracious sirin humblest manner I require your highnessthat it shall please you to declare in hearingof all these ears for where I am robbed and boundthere must I be unloosed although not thereat once and fully satisfied whether ever Idid broach this business to your highness orlaid any scruple in your way which mightinduce you to the question onit or everhave to you but with thanks to God for sucha royal lady spake one the least word that mightbe to the prejudice of her present stateor touch of her good personmy lord CardinalI do excuse you yea upon mine honourI free you fromt you are not to be taughtthat you have many enemies that know notwhy they are so but like to village cursbark when their fellows do by some of thesethe queen is put in anger youre excusedbut will you be more justified you everhave wished the sleeping of this business neverdesired it to be stirred but oft have hindered oftthe passages made toward it on my honourI speak my good lord Cardinal to this pointand thus far clear him now what moved me toitI will be bold with time and your attentionthen mark the inducement thus it came give heed toitmy consence first received a tendernessscruple and prick on certain speeches utteredby the Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassadorwho had been hither sent on the debatinga marriage btwixt the duke of Orleans andour daughter Mary inthe progress of this businessere a determinate resolution heI mean the bishop did require a respitewherein he might the king his lord advertisewhether our daughter were legitimaterespecting this our marriage with the dowagersometimes our brothers wife this respite shookthe bosom of my consence entered meyea with a splitting power and made to tremblethe region of my breast which forced such waythat many mazed considerings did throngand pressed in with this caution first methoughtI stood not in the smile of heaven who hadcommanded nature that my ladys wombif it conceived a male child by me shoulddo no more offices of life toit thanthe grave does to the dead for her male issueor died where they were made or shortly afterthis world had aired them hence I took a thoughtthis was a judgment on me that my kingdomwell worthy the best heir ofthe world should notbe gladded init by me then follows thatI weighed the danger which my realms stood inby this my issues fail and that gave to memany a groaning throe thus hulling inthe wild sea of my consence I did steertoward this remedy whereupon we arenow present here together thats to sayI meant to rectify my consence whichI then did feel full sick and yet not wellby all the revrend fathers of the landand doctors learned first I began in privatewith you my lord of Lincoln you rememberhow under my oppression I did reekwhen I first moved youvery well my liegeI have spoke long be pleased yourself to sayhow far you satisfied meso please your highnessthe question did at first so stagger mebearing a state of mighty moment initand consequence of dread that I committedthe daringest counsel that I had to doubtand did entreat your highness to this coursewhich you are running herethen I moved youmy lord of Canterbury and got your leaveto make this present summons unsolitedI left no reverend person in this courtbut by particular consent proceededunder your hands and seals therefore go onfor no dislike inthe world against the personof the good queen but the sharp thorny pointsof my alleged reasons drive this forwardprove but our marriage lawful by my lifeand kingly dignity we are contentedto wear our mortal state to come with herkatharine our queen before the primest creaturethats paragoned ofthe worldso please your highnessthe queen being absent itis a needful fitnessthat we adjourn this court till further daymean while must be an earnest motionmade to the queen to call back her appealshe intends unto his holinessI may perceivethese cardinals trifle with me I abhorthis dilatory sloth and tricks of Romemy learned and well-beloved servant Cranmerprithee return with thy approach I knowmy comfort comes along break up the courtI say set ontake thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troublessing and disperse em if thou canst Leave workingorpheus with his lute made treesand the mountain tops that freezebow themselves when he did singto his music plants and flowersever sprung as sun and showersthere had made a lasting springevery thing that heard him playeven the billows of the seahung their heads and then lay byin sweet music is such artkilling care and grief of heartfall asleep or hearing diehow nowant please your grace the two great cardinalswait in the presencewould they speak with methey willed me say so madampray their gracesto come nearwhat can be their businesswith me a poor weak woman falln from favourI do not like their coming now I think onitthey should be good men their affairs as righteousbut all hoods make not monkspeace to your highnessyour graces find me here part of a housewifeI would be all against the worst may happenwhat are your pleasures with me reverend lordsmay it please you noble madam to withdrawinto your private chamber we shall give youthe full cause of our comingspeak it heretheres nothing I have done yet o my consencedeserves a corner

set against emI know my life so even if your businessseek me out and that way I am wife inout with it boldly truth loves open dealingtanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenissimaO good

youif you speak truth for their poor mistress sakebelieve me she has had much wrong lord Cardinalthe willingest sin I ever yet committedmay be absolved in Englishnoble ladyI am sorry my

causealas I am a woman friendless hopelessmadam you wrong the kings love with these fearsyour hopes and friends are infinitein Englandbut little for my profit can you think lordsthat any Englishman dare give me counselor be a known friend gainst his highness pleasurethough he be grown so desperate to be honestand live a subject nay forsooth my friendsthey that must weigh out my afflictionsthey that my trust must grow to live not herethey are as all my other comforts far hencein mine own country lordsI would your gracewould leave your griefs and take my counselhow

sake lords convey my tristful queenfor tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyesO Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I seepeace good pint-pot peace good tickle-brain Harry I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears that thou art my son I have partly thy mothers word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me if then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries a question not to be asked Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses a question to be asked there is a thing Harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch as anent writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest for Harry now I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company but I know not his namewhat manner of man an it like your majestya goodly portly man infaith and a corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think his age some fifty or byr lady inclining to threescore and now I remember me his name is Falstaff if that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his looks if then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in that Falstaff him keep with the rest banish and tell me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this monthdost thou speak like a king do thou stand for me and iull play my fatherdepose me if thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulters harewell here I am setand here I stand Judge my mastersnow Harry whence come youmy noble lord from Eastcheapthe complaints I hear of thee are grievoussblood my lord they are false nayiull tickle ye for a young prince infaithswearest thou ungracious boy henceforth neer look on me thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of a fat old man a tun of man is thy companion why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that bolting-hutch of beastliness that swoln parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed cloak-bag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in years wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in nothingI would your grace would take me with you whom means your gracethat villanous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff that old white-bearded Satanmy lord the man I knowI know thou dostbut to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know that he is old the more the pity his white hairs do witness it but that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster that I utterly deny if sack and sugar be a fault God help the wicked if to be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that I know is damned if to be fat be to be hated then Pharaohs lean kine are to be loved no my good lord banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff valiant Jack Falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff banish not him thy Harrys company banish not him thy Harrys company banish plump Jack and banish all the worldI do I willO my lord my lord the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the doorout ye rogue play out the play I have much to say in the behalf of that FalstaffO Jesu my lord my lordheigh heigh the devil rides upon a fiddle-stick whats the matterthe sheriff and all the watch are at the door they are come to search the house Shall I let them indost thou hear Hal never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially mad without seeming soand thou a natural coward without instinctI deny your major if you will deny the sheriff so if not let him enter if I become not a cart as well as another man a plague on my bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as anothergo hide thee behind the arras the rest walk up above now my masters for a true face and good consenceboth which I have had but their date is out and therefore iull hide mecall in the sheriffnow master sheriff whats your will with mefirst pardon me my lord a hue and cryhath followed certain men unto this housewhat menone of them is well known my gracious lorda gross fat manas fat as butterthe man I do assure you is not herefor I myself at this time have employed himand sheriff I will engage my word to theethat I will by to-morrow dinner-timesend him to answer thee or any manfor anything he shall be charged withaland so let me entreat you leave the houseI will my lord there are two gentlemenhave in this robbery lost three hundred marksit may be so if he have robbed these menhe shall be answerable and so farewellgood night my noble lordI think it is good morrow is it notindeed my lord I think it be two oclockthis oily rascal is known as well as Paulsgo call him forthfalstaff fast asleep behind the arras and snorting like a horsehark how hard he fetches breathsearch his pocketswhat hast thou foundnothing but papers my lordlets see what they be read themO monstrous but one half-pennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack what there is else keep close well read it at more advantage there let him sleep till day iull to the court in the morning we must all to the wars and thy place shall be honourable iull procure this fat rogue a charge of foot and I know his death will be a march of twelve-score the money shall be paid back again with advantage be with me betimes in the morning and so good morrow Petogood morrow good my lordthese promises are fair the parties sureand our induction full of prosperous hopelord Mortimer and cousin Glendowerwill you sit downand uncle Worcester a plague upon itI have forgot the mapno here it issit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspurfor by that name as oft as Lancasterdoth speak of you his cheek looks pale and witha rising sigh he wishes you in heavenand you in hell as often as he hearsowen Glendower spoke ofI cannot blame him at my nativitythe front of heaven was full of fiery shapesof burning cressets and at my birththe frame and huge foundation of the earthshaked like a cowardwhy so it would have done at the same season if your mothers cat had but kittened though yourself had never been bornI say the earth did shake when I was bornand I say the earth was not of my mindif you suppose as fearing you it shookthe heavens were all on fire the earth did trembleO then the earth shook to see the heavens on fireand not in fear of your nativitydiseased nature oftentimes breaks forthin strange eruptions oft the teeming earthis with a kind of colic pinched and vexedby the imprisoning of unruly windwithin her womb which for enlargement strivingshakes the old beldam earth and topples downsteeples and moss-grown towers At your birthour grandam earth having this distemperaturein passion shookcousin of many menI do not bear these crossings give me leaveto tell you once again that at my birththe front of heaven was full of fiery shapesthe goats ran from the mountains and the herdswere strangely clamorous to the frighted fieldsthese signs have marked me extraordinaryand all the courses of my life do showI am not in the roll of common menwhere is he living clipped in with the seathat chides the banks of England Scotland Waleswhich calls me pupil or hath read to meand bring him out that is but womans soncan trace me in the tedious ways of artand hold me pace in deep experimentsI think theres no man speaks better Welshiull to dinnerpeace cousin Percy you will make him madI can call spirits from the vasty deepwhy so can I or so can any manbut will they come when you do call for themwhy I can teach thee cousin to commandthe deviland I can teach thee coz to shame the devilby telling truth tell truth and shame the devilif thou have power to raise him bring him hitherand iull be sworn I have power to shame him henceO while you live tell truth and shame the devilcome comeno more of this unprofitable chatthree times hath Henry Bolingbroke made headagainst my power thrice from the banks of Wyeand sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent himbootless home and weather-beaten backhome without boots and in foul weather toohow scapes he agues in the devils namecome heres the map shall we divide our rightaccording to our threefold order taenthe archdeacon hath divided itinto three limits very equallyengland from Trent and Severn hithertoby south and east is to my part assignedall westward Wales beyond the Severn shoreand all the fertile land within that boundto Owen Glendower and dear coz to youthe remnant northward lying off from Trentand our indentures tripartite are drawnwhich being sealed interchangeablya business that this night may executeto-morrow cousin Percy you and Iand my good lord of Worcester will set forthto meet your father and the Scottish poweras is appointed us at Shrewsburymy father Glendower is not ready yetnor shall we need his help these fourteen dayswithin that space you may have drawn togetheryour tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemena shorter time shall send me to you lordsand in my conduct shall your ladies comefrom whom you now must steal and take no leavefor there will be a world of water shedupon the parting of your wives and youmethinks my moiety north from Burton herein quantity equals not one of yourssee how this river comes me cranking inand cuts me from the best of all my landa huge half-moon a monstrous cantle outiull have the current in this place dammed upand here the smug and silver Trent shall runin a new channel fair and evenlyit shall not wind with such a deep indentto rob me of so rich a bottom herenot wind it shall it must you see it dothyea butmark how he bears his course and runs me upwith like advantage on the other sidegelding the opposed continent as muchas on the other side it takes from youyea but a little charge will trench him hereand on this north side win this cape of landand then he runs straight and eveniull have it so a little charge will do itI will not have it alteredwill not youno nor you shall notwho shall say me naywhy that will Ilet me not understand you thenspeak it in WelshI can speak English lord as well as youfor I was trained up in the English courtwhere being but young I framed to the harpmany an English ditty lovely welland gave the tongue an helpful ornamenta virtue that was never seen in youmarry and im glad of it with all my heartI had rather be a kitten and cry mewthan one of these same metre ballad-mongersI had rather hear a brazen canstick turnedor a dry wheel grate on the axle-treeand that would set my teeth nothing on edgenothing so much as minng poetryitis like the forced gait of a shuffling nagcome you shall have Trent turnedI do not care iull give thrice so much landto any well-deserving friendbut in the way of bargain mark you meiull cavil on the ninth part of a hairare the indentures drawn shall we be gonethe moon shines fair you may away by nightiull haste the writer and withalbreak with your wives of your departure henceI am afraid my daughter will run madso much she doteth on her Mortimerfie cousin Percy how you cross my fatherI cannot choose sometimes he angers mewith telling me of the moldwarp and the antof the dreamer Merlin and his propheesand of a dragon and a finless fisha clip-winged griffin and a moulten ravena couching lion and a ramping catand such a deal of skimble-skamble stuffas puts me from my faith iull tell thee whathe held me last night at least nine hoursin reckoning up the several devils namesthat were his lackeys I cried hum and well go to but marked him not a word O hes as tediousas a tired horse a railing wifeworse than a smoky house I had rather livewith cheese and garlick in a windmill farthan feed on cates and have him talk to mein any summer-house in Christendomin faith he is a worthy gentlemanexceedingly well read and profitedin strange concealments valiant as a lionand wondrous affable and as bountifulas mines of India Shall I tell you cousinhe holds your temper in a high respectand curbs himself even of his natural scopewhen you do cross his humour faith he doesI warrant you that man is not alivemight so have tempted him as you have donewithout the taste of danger and reproofbut do not use it oft let me entreat youin faith my lord you are too wilfulblameand since your coming hither have done enoughto put him quite beside his patienceyou must needs learn lord to amend this faultthough sometimes it show greatness courage bloodand thats the dearest grace it renders youyet oftentimes it doth present harsh ragedefect of manners want of governmentpride haughtiness opinion and disdainthe least of which haunting a noblemanloseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stainupon the beauty of all parts besidesbeguiling them of commendationwell I am schooled good manners be your speedhere come our wives and let us take our leavethis is the deadly spite that angers memy wife can speak no English I no Welshmy daughter weeps she will not part with youshell be a soldier too shell to the warsgood father tell her that she and my aunt Percyshall follow in your conduct speedilyshes desperate here a peevish self-willed harlotry one that no persuasion can do good uponI understand thy looks that pretty Welshwhich thou pourest down from these swelling heavensI am too perfect in and but for shamein such a parley would I answer theeI understand thy kisses and thou mineand thats a feeling disputationbut I will never be a truant lovetill I have learned thy language for thy tonguemakes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennedsung by a fair queen in a summers bowerwith ravishing division to her lutenay if you melt then will she run madO I am ignorance itself in thisshe bids youupon the wanton rushes lay you downand rest your gentle head upon her lapand she will sing the song that pleaseth youand on your eye-lids crown the god of sleepcharming your blood with pleasing heavinessmaking such difference btwixt wake and sleepas is the difference between day and nightthe hour before the heavenly-harnessed teambegins his golden progress in the eastwith all my heart iull sit and hear her singby that time will our book I think be drawndo soand those musians that shall play to youhang in the air a thousand leagues from henceand straight they shall be here sit and attendcome Kate thou art perfect in lying down come quick quick that I may lay my head in thy lapgo ye giddy goosenow I perceive the devil understands Welshand itis no marvel he is so humorousbyr lady hes a good musianthen should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours Lie still ye thief and hear the lady sing in WelshI had rather hear Lady my brach how in Irishwouldst thou have thy head brokennothen be stillneither itis a womans faultnow God help theeto the Welsh ladys bedwhats thatpeace she singscome Kate iull have your song toonot mine in good soothnot yours in good sooth heart you swear like a comfit-makers wife not you in good sooth and as true as I live and as God shall mend me and as sure as day and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oathsas if thou never walkedst further than finsburyswear me Kate like a lady as thou arta good mouth-filling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper-gingerbreadto velvet-guards and Sunday-tizenscome singI will not singitis the next way to turn tailor or be red-breast teacher An the indentures be drawn iull away within these two hours and so come in when ye willcome come lord Mortimer you are as slowas hot lord Percy is on fire to goby this our book is drawn we will but sealand then to horse immediatelywith all my heartlords give us leave the prince of Wales and Imust have some private conference but be near at handfor we shall presently have need of youI know not whether God will have it sofor some displeasing service I have donethat in his secret doom out of my bloodhell breed revengement and a scourge for mebut thou dost in thy passages of lifemake me believe that thou art only markedfor the hot vengeance and the rod of heavento punish my mistreadings Tell me elsecould such inordinate and low desiressuch poor such bare such lewd such mean attemptssuch barren pleasures rude societyas thou art matched withal and grafted toaccompany the greatness of thy bloodand hold their level with thy princely heartso please your majesty I would I couldquit all offences with as clear excuseas well as I am doubtless I can purgemyself of many I am charged withalyet such extenuation let me begas in reproof of many tales devisedwhich oft the ear of greatness needs must hearby smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongersI may for some things true wherein my youthhath faulty wandered and irregularfind pardon on my true submissiongod pardon thee yet let me wonder Harryat thy affections which do hold a wingquite from the flight of all thy ancestorsthy place in counselthou hast rudely lostwhich by thy younger brother is suppliedand art almost an alien to the heartsof all the court and princes of my bloodthe hope and expectation of thy timeis ruined and the soul of every manprophetically do forethink thy fallhad I so lavish of my presence beenso common-hackneyed in the eyes of menso stale and cheap to vulgar companyopinion that did help me to the crownhad still kept loyal to possessionand left me in reputeless banishmenta fellow of no mark nor likelihoodby being seldom seen I could not stirbut like a comet I was wondered atthat men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is Bolingbroke and then I stole all courtesy from heavenand dressed myself in such humilitythat I did pluck allegiance from mens heartsloud shouts and salutations from their mouthseven in the presence of the crowned kingthus did I keep my person fresh and newmy presence like a robe pontificalneer seen but wondered at and so my stateseldom but sumptuous showed like a feastand won by rareness such solemnitythe skipping king he ambled up and downwith shallow jesters and rash bavin witssoon kindled and soon burnt carded his statemingled his royalty with capering foolshad his great name profaned with their scornsand gave his countenance against his nameto laugh at gibing boys and stand the pushof every beardless vain comparativegrew a companion to the common streetsenfeoffed himself to popularitythat being daily swallowed by mens eyesthey surfeited with honey and beganto loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a littlemore than a little is by much too muchso when he had occasion to be seenhe was but as the cuckoo is in Juneheard not regarded seen but with such eyesas sick and blunted with communityafford no extraordinary gazesuch as is bent on sun-like majestywhen it shines seldom in admiring eyesbut rather drowsed and hung their eyelids downslept in his face and rendered such aspectas cloudy men use to their adversariesbeing with his presence glutted gorged and fulland in that very line Harry standest thoufor thou hast lost thy princely privilegewith vile partipation not an eyebut is aweary of thy common sightsave mine which hath desired to see thee morewhich now doth that I would not have it domake blind itself with foolish tendernessI shall hereafter my thrice gracious lordbe more myselffor all the worldas thou art to this hour was Richard thenwhen I from France set foot at Ravenspurghand even as I was then is Percy nownow by my sceptre and my soul to boothe hath more worthy interest to the statethan thou the shadow of successionfor of no right nor colour like to righthe doth fill fields with harness in the realmturns head against the lions armed jawsand being no more in debt to years than thouleads anent lords and reverend bishops onto bloody battles and to bruising armswhat never-dying honour hath he gotagainst renowned Douglas whose high deedswhose hot incursions and great name in armsholds from all soldiers chief majorityand military title capitalthrough all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christthrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothesthis infant warrior in his enterprisesdiscomfited great Douglas taen him onceenlarged him and made a friend of himto fill the mouth of deep defiance upand shake the peace and safety of our throneand what say you to this Percy northumberlandthe Archbishops grace of York Douglas Mortimercapitulate against us and are upbut wherefore do I tell these news to theewhy Harry do I tell thee of my foeswhich art my nearest and dearest enemythou that art like enough through vassal fearbase inclination and the start of spleento fight against me under Percys payto dog his heels and curtsy at his frownsto show how much thou art degeneratedo not think so you shall not find it soand God forgive them that so much have swayedyour majestys good thoughts away from meI will redeem all this on Percys headand in the closing of some glorious daybe bold to tell you that I am your sonwhen I will wear a garment all of bloodand stain my favours in a bloody maskwhich washed away shall scour my shame with itand that shall be the day wheneer it lightsthat this same child of honour and renownthis gallant Hotspur this all-praised knightand your unthought of Harry chance to meetfor every honour sitting on his helmwould they were multitudes and on my headmy shames redoubled for the time will comethat I shall make this northern youth exchangehis glorious deeds for my indignitiespercy is but my factor good my lordto engross up glorious deeds on my behalfand I will call him to so strict accountthat he shall render every glory upyea even the slightest worship of his timeor I will tear the reckoning from his heartthis in the name of God I promise herethe which if he be pleased I shall performI do beseech your majesty may salvethe long-grown wounds of my intemperanceif not the end of life cancels all bandsand I will die a hundred thousand deathsere break the smallest parcel of this vowa hundred thousand rebels die in thisthou shalt have charge and sovereign trust hereinhow now good Blunt thy looks are full of speedso hath the business that I come to speak oflord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent wordthat Douglas and the English rebels metthe eleventh of this month at Shrewsburya mighty and a fearful head they areif promises be kept on every handas ever offered foul play in a statethe earl of

wish this tavern were my drumwell said my noble Scot if speaking truthin this fine age were not thought flatterysuch attribution should the Douglas haveas not a soldier of this seasons stampshould go so general current through the worldby God I cannot flatter do defythe tongues of soothers but a braver placein my hearts love hath no man than yourselfnay task me to my word approve me lordthou art the king of honourno man so potent breathes upon the groundbut I will beard himdo so and itis wellwhat letters hast thou thereI can but thank youthese letters come from your fatherletters from him why comes he not himselfhe cannot come my lord hes grievous sickZounds how has he the leisure to be sickin such a justling time who leads his powerunder whose government come they alonghis letters bear his mind not I my lordI prithee tell me doth he keep his bedhe did my lord four days ere I set forthand at the time of my departure thencehe was much feared by his physiansI would the state of time had first been wholeere he by sickness had been visitedhis health was never better worth than nowsick now droop now this sickness doth infectthe very life-blood of our enterpriseitis catching hither even to our camphe writes me here that inward sicknessand that his friends by deputation could notso soon be drawn nor did he think it meetto lay so dangerous and dear a truston any soul removed but on his ownyet doth he give us bold advertisementthat with our small conjunction we should onto see how fortune is disposed to usfor as he writes there is no quailing nowbecause the king is certainly possessedof all our purposes what say you to ityour fathers sickness is a maim to usa perilous gash a very limb lopped offand yet in faith itis not his present wantseems more than we shall find it were it goodto set the exact wealth of all our statesall at one cast to set so rich a mainon the nice hazard of one doubtful hourit were not good for therein should we readthe very bottom and the soul of hopethe very list the very utmost boundof all our fortunesfaith and so we shouldwhere now remains a sweet reversionwe may boldly spend upon the hope of whatis to come ina comfort of retirement lives in thisa rendezvous a home to fly untoif that the devil and mischance look bigupon the maidenhead of our affairsbut yet I would your father had been herethe quality and hair of our attemptbrooks no division it will be thoughtby some that know not why he is awaythat wisdom loyalty and mere dislikeof our proceedings kept the earl from henceand think how such an apprehensionmay turn the tide of fearful factionand breed a kind of question in our causefor well you know we of the offering sidemust keep aloof from strict arbitrementand stop all sight-holes every loop from whencethe eye of reason may pry in upon usthis absence of your fathers draws a curtainthat shows the ignorant a kind of fearbefore not dreamt ofyou strain too farI rather of his absence make this useit lends a lustre and more great opiniona larger dare to our great enterprisethan if the earl were here for men must thinkif we without his help can make a headto push against the kingdom with his helpwe shall oerturn it topsy-turvy downyet all goes well yet all our joints are wholeas heart can think there is not such a wordspoke of in Scotland as this term of fearmy cousin Vernon welcome by my soulpray God my news be worth a welcome lordthe earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strongis marching hitherwards with him prince Johnno harm what moreand further I have learnedthe king himself in person is set forthor hitherwards intended speedilywith strong and mighty preparationhe shall be welcome too where is his sonthe nimble-footed madcap prince of Walesand his comrades that daffed the world asideand bid it passall furnished all in armsall plumed like estridges that wing the windbaited like eagles having lately bathedglittering in golden coats like imagesas full of spirit as the month of Mayand gorgeous as the sun at midsummerwanton as youthful goats wild as young bullsI saw young Harry with his beaver onhis cushes on his thighs gallantly armedrise from the ground like feathered Mercuryand vaulted with such ease into his seatas if an angel dropped down from the cloudsto turn and wind a fiery Pegasusand witch the world with noble horsemanshipno more no more worse than the sun in marchthis praise doth nourish agues let them comethey come like sacrifices in their trimand to the fire-eyed maid of smoky warall hot and bleeding will we offer themthe mailed Mars shall on his altar situp to the ears in blood I am on fireto hear this rich reprisal is so nighand yet not ours come let me taste my horsewho is to bear me like a thunderboltagainst the bosom of the prince of Walesharry to Harry shall hot horse to horsemeet and neer part till one drop down a corseO that Glendower were comethere is more newsI learned in Worcester as I rode alonghe cannot draw his power these fourteen daysthats the worst tidings that I hear of yetay by my faith that bears a frosty soundwhat may the kings whole battle reach untoto thirty thousandforty let it bemy father and Glendower being both awaythe powers of us may serve so great a daycome let us take a muster speedilydoomsday is near die all die merrilytalk not of dying I am out of fearof death or deaths hand for this one half yearbardolph get thee before to Coventry fill me a bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through well to Sutton-cofil to-nightwill you give me money captainlay out lay outthis bottle makes an angelan if it do take it for thy labour and if it make twenty take them all iull answer the coinage Bid my Lieutenant Peto meet me at the towns endI will captain farewellif I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused gurnet I have misused the kings press damnably I have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I press me none but good householders yeomens sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins heads and they have bought out their services and now my whole charge consists of anents corporals lieutenants gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth where the gluttons dogs licked his sores and such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust serving-men younger sons to younger brothers revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen the cankers of a calm world and a long peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced anent and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping from eating draff and husks a mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies no eye hath seen such scarecrows iull not march through Coventry with them thats flat nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed I had the most of them out of prison theres but a shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a heralds coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose inn-keeper of Daventry but thats all one theyll find linen enough on every hedgehow now blown Jack how now quiltwhat Hal how now mad wag what a devil dost thou in Warwickshire my good lord of Westmoreland I cry you mercy I thought your honour had already been at Shrewsburyfaith sir John itis more than time that I were there and you too but my powers are there already the king I can tell you looks for us all we must away all nighttut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to steal creamI think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter but tell me Jack whose fellows are these that come aftermine Hal mineI did never see such pitiful rascalstut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for powder theyll fill a pit as well as better tush man mortal men mortal menay but sir John methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarlyfaith for their poverty I know not where they had that and for their bareness I am sure they never learned that of meno iull be sworn unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare but sirrah make haste Percy is already in the fieldwhat is the king encampedhe is sir John I fear we shall stay too longwellto the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feastfits a dull fighter and a keen guestwell fight with him to-nightit may not beyou give him then advantagenot a whitwhy say you so looks he not for supplyso do wehis is certain ours is doubtfulgood cousin be advised stir not to-nightdo not my lordyou do not counsel wellyou speak it out of fear and cold heartdo me no slander Douglas by my lifeand I dare well maintain it with my lifeif well-respected honour bid me onI hold as little counsel with weak fearas you my lord or any Scot that this day liveslet it be seen to-morrow in the battlewhich of us fearsyea or to-nightcontentto-night say Icome come it may not be I wonder muchbeing men of such great leading as you arethat you foresee not what impedimentsdrag back our expedition certain horseof my cousin Vernons are not yet come upyour uncle Worcesters horse came but to-dayand now their pride and mettle is asleeptheir courage with hard labour tame and dullthat not a horse is half the half of himselfso are the horses of the enemyin general journey-bated and brought lowthe better part of ours are full of restthe number of the king exceedeth oursfor Gods sake cousin stay till all come inI come with gracious offers from the kingif you vouchsafe me hearing and respectwelcome sir Walter Blunt and would to Godyou were of our determinationsome of us love you well and even those someenvy your great deservings and good namebecause you are not of our qualitybut stand against us like an enemyand God defend but still I should stand soso long as out of limit and true ruleyou stand against anointed majestybut to my charge the king hath sent to knowthe nature of your griefs and whereuponyou conjure from the breast of civil peacesuch bold hostility teaching his duteous landaudaous cruelty if that the kinghave any way your good deserts forgotwhich he confesseth to be manifoldhe bids you name your griefs and with all speedyou shall have your desires with interestand pardon absolute for yourself and theseherein misled by your suggestionthe king is kind and well we know the kingknows at what time to promise when to paymy father and my uncle and myselfdid give him that same royalty he wearsand when he was not six-and-twenty strongsick in the worlds regard wretched and lowa poor unminded outlaw sneaking homemy father gave him welcome to the shoreand when he heard him swear and vow to Godhe came but to be duke of Lancasterto sue his livery and beg his peacewith tears of innocency and terms of zealmy father in kind heart and pity movedswore him assistance and performed it toonow when the lords and barons of the realmperceived northumberland did lean to himthe more and less came in with cap and kneemet him in boroughs ties villagesattended him on bridges stood in laneslaid gifts before him proffered him their oathsgave him their heirs as pages followed himeven at the heels in golden multitudeshe presently as greatness knows itselfsteps me a little higher than his vowmade to my father while his blood was poorupon the naked shore at Ravenspurghand now forsooth takes on him to reformsome certain edicts and some strait decreesthat lie too heavy on the commonwealthcries out upon abuses seems to weepover his countrys wrongs and by this facethis seeming brow of justice did he winthe hearts of all that he did angle forproceeded further cut me off the headsof all the favourites that the absent kingin deputation left behind him herewhen he was personal in the Irish wartut I came not to hear thisthen to the pointin short time after he deposed the kingsoon after that deprived him of his lifeand in the neck of that tasked the whole stateto make that worse suffered his kinsman marchwho is if every owner were well placedindeed his king to be engaged in Walesthere without ransom to lie forfeiteddisgraced me in my happy victoriessought to entrap me by intelligencerated my uncle from the counl-boardin rage dismissed my father from the courtbroke oath on oath committed wrong on wrongand in conclusion drove us to seek outthis head of safety and withal to pryinto his title the which we findtoo indirect for long continuanceshall I return this answer to the kingnot so sir Walter well withdraw awhilego to the king and let there be impawnedsome surety for a safe return againand in the morning early shall my unclebring him our purposes and so farewellI would you would accept of grace and loveand may be so we shallpray God you dohie good sir Michael bear this sealed briefwith winged haste to the lord marshalthis to my cousin Scroop and all the restto whom they are directed if you knewhow much they do import you would make hastemy good lordI guess their tenourlike enough you doto-morrow good sir Michael is a daywherein the fortune of ten thousand menmust bide the touch for sir at Shrewsburyas I am truly given to understandthe king with mighty and quick-raised powermeets with lord Harry and I fear sir Michaelwhat with the sickness of northumberlandwhose power was in the first proportionand what with Owen Glendowers absence thencewho with them was a rated sinew tooand comes not in oer-ruled by propheesI fear the power of Percy is too weakto wage an instant trial with the kingwhy my good lord you need not fearthere is the Douglas and lord Mortimerno Mortimer is not therebut there is Mordake Vernon lord Harry Percyand theres my lord of Worcester and a headof gallant warriors noble gentlemenand so there is but yet the king hath drawnthe speal head of all the land togetherthe prince of Wales lord John of Lancasterthe noble Westmoreland and war-like Bluntand many moe corrivals and dear menof estimation and command in armsdoubt not my lord they shall be well opposedI hope no less yet needful itis to fearand to prevent the worse sir Michael speedfor if lord Percy thrive not ere the kingdismiss his power he means to visit usfor he hath heard of our confederacyand itis but wisdom to make strong against himtherefore make haste I must go write againto other friends and so farewell sir Michaelhow bloodily the sun begins to peerabove yon busky hill the day looks paleat his distemperaturethe southern winddoth play the trumpet to his purposesand by his hollow whistling in the leavesforetells a tempest and a blustering daythen with the losers let it sympathizefor nothing can seem foul to those that winhow now my lord of Worcester itis not wellthat you and I should meet upon such termsas now we meet you have deceived our trustand made us doff our easy robes of peaceto crush our old limbs in ungentle steelthis is not well my lord this is not wellwhat say you to it will you again unknitthis churlish knot of all-abhorred warand move in that obedient orb againwhere you did give a fair and natural lightand be no more an exhaled meteora prodigy of fear and a portentof broached mischief to the unborn timeshear me my liegefor mine own part I could be well contentto entertain the lag-end of my lifewith quiet hours for I do protestI have not sought the day of this dislikeyou have not sought it how comes it thenrebellion lay in his way and he found itpeace chewet peaceit pleased your majesty to turn your looksof favour from myself and all our houseand yet I must remember you my lordwe were the first and dearest of your friendsfor you my staff of office did I breakin Richards time and posted day and nightto meet you on the way and kiss your handwhen yet you were in place and in accountnothing so strong and fortunate as Iit was myself my brother and his sonthat brought you home and boldly did outdarethe dangers of the time you swore to usand you did swear that oath at Doncasterthat you did nothing purpose gainst the statenor claim no further than your new-falln rightthe seat of gaunt dukedom of Lancasterto this we swore our aid but in short spaceit rained down fortune showering on your headand such a flood of greatness fell on youwhat with our help what with the absent kingwhat with the injuries of a wanton timethe seeming sufferances that you had borneand the contrarious winds that held the kingso long in his unlucky Irish warsthat all in England did repute him deadand from this swarm of fair advantagesyou took occasion to be quickly wooedto gripe the general sway into your handforgot your oath to us at Doncasterand being fed by us you used us soas that ungentle gull the cuckoos birduseth the sparrow did oppress our nestgrew by our feeding to so great a bulkthat even our love durst not come near your sightfor fear of swallowing but with nimble wingwe were enforced for safetys sake to flyout of your sight and raise this present headwhereby we stand opposed by such meansas you yourself have forged against yourselfby unkind usage dangerous countenanceand violation of all faith and trothsworn to us in your younger enterprisethese things indeed you have articulateproclaimed at market-crosses read in churchesto face the garment of rebellionwith some fine colour that may please the eyeof fickle changelings and poor discontentswhich gape and rub the elbow at the newsof hurlyburly innovationand never yet did insurrection wantsuch water-colours to impaint his causenor moody beggars starving for a timeof pell-mell havoc and confusionin both our armies there is many a soulshall pay full dearly for this encounterif once they join in trial Tell your nephewthe prince of Wales doth join with all the worldin praise of Henry Percy by my hopesthis present enterprise set off his headI do not think a braver gentlemanmore active-valiant or more valiant-youngmore daring or more bold is now aliveto grace this latter age with noble deedsfor my part I may speak it to my shameI have a truant been to chivalryand so I hear he doth account me tooyet this before my fathers majestyI am content that he shall take the oddsof his great name and estimationand will to save the blood on either sidetry fortune with him in a single fightand prince of Wales so dare we venture theealbeit considerations infinitedo make against it no good Worcester nowe love our people well even those we lovethat are misled upon your cousins partand will they take the offer of our graceboth he and they and you yea every manshall be my friend again and iull be hisso tell your cousin and bring me wordwhat he will do but if he will not yieldrebuke and dread correction wait on usand they shall do their office so be gonewe will not now be troubled with replywe offer fair take it advisedlyit will not be accepted on my lifethe Douglas and the Hotspur both togetherare confident against the world in armshence therefore every leader to his chargefor on their answer will we set on themand God befriend us as our cause is justhal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so itis a point of friendshipnothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship Say thy prayers and farewellI would it were bed-time Hal and all wellwhy thou owest God a deathitis not due yet I would be loath to pay him before his day what need I be so forward with him that calls not on me well itis no matter honour pricks me on yea but how if honour prick me off when I come on how then can honour set to a leg no Or an arm no Or take away the grief of a wound no Honour hath no skill in surgery then no what is honour a word what is that word honour Air a trim reckoning who hath it he that died o Wednesday doth he feel it no doth he hear it no it is insensible then yea to the dead but will it not live with the living no why Detraction will not suffer it therefore iull none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechismO no my nephew must not know sir Richardthe liberal kind offer of the kingitwere best he didthen are we all undoneit is not possible it cannot bethe king should keep his word in loving ushe will suspect us still and find a timeto punish this offence in other faultssuspion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyesfor treason is but trusted like the foxwho neer so tame so cherished and locked upwill have a wild trick of his ancestorslook how we can or sad or merrilyinterpretation will misquote our looksand we shall feed like oxen at a stallthe better cherished still the nearer deathmy nephews trespass may be well forgotit hath the excuse of youth and heat of bloodand an adopted name of privilegea hare-brained Hotspur governed by a spleenall his offences live upon my headand on his fathers we did train him onand his corruption being taen from uswe as the spring of all shall pay for alltherefore good cousin let not Harry knowin any case the offer of the kingdeliver what you will iull say itis sohere comes your cousinmy uncle is returned deliver upmy lord of Westmoreland uncle what newsthe king will bid you battle presentlydefy him by the lord of Westmorelandlord Douglas go you and tell him somarry and shall and very willinglythere is no seeming mercy in the kingdid you beg any God forbidI told him gently of our grievancesof his oath-breaking which he mended thusby now forswearing that he is forswornhe calls us rebels traitors and will scourgewith haughty arms this hateful name in usarm gentlemen to arms for I have throwna brave defiance in king Henrys teethand Westmoreland that was engaged did bear itwhich cannot choose but bring him quickly onthe prince of Wales stepped forth before the kingand nephew challenged you to single fightO would the quarrel lay upon our headsand that no man might draw short breath to-daybut I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell mehow showed his tasking seemed it in contemptno by my soul I never in my lifedid hear a challenge urged more modestlyunless a brother should a brother dareto gentle exerse and proof of armshe gave you all the duties of a mantrimmed up your praises with a princely tonguespoke your deservings like a chroniclemaking you ever better than his praiseby still dispraising praise valued with youand which became him like a prince indeedhe made a blushing tal of himselfand chid his truant youth with such a graceas if he mastered there a double spiritof teaching and of learning instantlythere did he pause but let me tell the worldif he outlive the envy of this dayengland did never owe so sweet a hopeso much misconstrued in his wantonnesscousin I think thou art enamouredon his follies never did I hearof any prince so wild a libertinebut be he as he will yet once ere nightI will embrace him with a soldiers armthat he shall shrink under my courtesyarm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friendsbetter consider what you have to dothan I that have not well the gift of tonguecan lift your blood up with persuasionmy lord here are letters for youI cannot read them nowO gentlemen the time of life is shortto spend that shortness basely were too longif life did ride upon a dials pointstill ending at the arrival of an houran if we live we live to tread on kingsif die brave death when princes die with usnow for our consences the arms are fairwhen the intent of bearing them is justmy lord prepare the king comes on apaceI thank him that he cuts me from my talefor I profess not talking Only thislet each man do his best and here draw Ia sword whose temper I intend to stainwith the best blood that I can meet withalin the adventure of this perilous daynow Esperance Percy and set onsound all the lofty instruments of warand by that music let us all embracefor heaven to earth some of us never shalla second time do such a courtesywhat is thy name that in the battle thusthou crossest me what honour dost thou seekupon my headknow then my name is Douglasand I do haunt thee in the battle thusbecause some tell me that thou art a kingthey tell thee truethe lord of Stafford dear to-day hath boughtthy likeness for instead of thee king Harrythis sword hath ended him so shall it theeunless thou yield thee as my prisonerI was not born a yielder thou proud Scotand thou shalt find a king that will revengelord Staffords deathO Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thusI never had triumphed upon a Scotalls done alls won here breathless lies the kingwhereherethis Douglas no I know this face full wella gallant knight he was his name was Bluntsemblably furnished like the king himselfa fool go with thy soul whither it goesa borrowed title hast thou bought too dearwhy didst thou tell me that thou wert a kingthe king hath many marching in his coatsnow by my sword I will kill all his coatsiull murder all his wardrobe piece by pieceuntil I meet the kingup and awayour soldiers stand full fairly for the daythough I could scape shot-free at London I fear the shot here heres no scoring but upon the pate Soft who art thou sir Walter Blunt theres honour for you heres no vanity I am as hot as molten lead and as heavy too God keep lead out of me I need no more weight than mine own bowels I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered theres not three of my hundred and fifty left alive and they are for the towns end to beg during life but who comes herewhat standest thou idle here lend me thy swordmany a nobleman lies stark and stiffunder the hoofs of vaunting enemieswhose deaths are unrevenged prithee lend me thy swordO Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day I have paid Percy I have made him surehe is indeed and living to kill theeI prithee lend me thy swordnay before God Hal if Percy be alive thou gettest not my sword but take my pistol if thou wiltgive it me what is it in the caseay Hal itis hot itis hot theres that will sack a tywhat isit a time to jest and dally nowwell if Percy be alive iull pierce him if he do come in my way so if he do not if I come in his willingly let him make a carbonado of me I like not such grinning honour as sir Walter hath give me life which if I can save so if not honour comes unlooked for and theres an endI pritheeharry withdraw thyself thou bleedest too muchlord John of Lancaster go you with himnot I my lord unless I did bleed tooI beseech your majesty make uplest your retirement do amaze your friendsI will do somy lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tentcome my lord iull lead you to your tentlead me my lord I do not need your helpand God forbid a shallow scratch should drivethe prince of Wales from such a field as thiswhere stained nobility lies trodden onand rebels arms triumph in massacreswe breathe too long come cousin Westmorelandour duty this way lies for Gods sake comeby God thou hast deceived me LancasterI did not think thee lord of such a spiritbefore I loved thee as a brother Johnbut now I do respect thee as my soulI saw him hold lord Percy at the pointwith lustier maintenance than I did look forof such an ungrown warriorO this boylends mettle to us allanother king they grow like Hydras headsI am the Douglas fatal to all thosethat wear those colours on them what art thouthat counterfeitest the person of a kingthe king himself who Douglas grieves at heartso many of his shadows thou hast metand not the very king I have two boysseek Percy and thyself about the fieldbut seeing thou fallest on me so luckilyI will assay thee so defend thyselfI fear thou art another counterfeitand yet in faith thou bearest thee like a kingbut mine I am sure thou art whoeer thou beand thus I win theehold up thy head vile Scot or thou art likenever to hold it up again the spiritsof valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my armsit is the prince of Wales that threatens theewho never promiseth but he means to paycheerly my lord how fares your gracesir Nicholas gawsey hath for succour sentand so hath Clifton iull to Clifton straightstay and breathe awhilethou hast redeemed thy lost opinionand showed thou makest some tender of my lifein this fair rescue thou hast brought to meO God they did me too much injurythat ever said I hearkened for your deathif it were so I might have let alonethe insulting hand of Douglas over youwhich would have been as speedy in your endas all the poisonous potions in the worldand saved the treacherous labour of your sonmake up to Clifton iull to sir Nicholas gawseyif I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouththou speakest as if I would deny my namemy name is Harry Percywhy then I seea very valiant rebel of that nameI am the prince of Wales and think not Percyto share with me in glory any moretwo stars keep not their motion in one spherenor can one England brook a double reignof Harry Percy and the prince of Walesnor shall it Harry for the hour is cometo end the one of us and would to Godthy name in arms were now as great as mineiull make it greater ere I part from theeand all the budding honours on thy crestiull crop to make a garland for my headI can no longer brook thy vanitieswell said Hal to it Hal nay you shall find no boys play here I can tell youO Harry thou hast robbed me of my youthI better brook the loss of brittle lifethan those proud titles thou hast won of methey wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my fleshbut thoughts the slave of life and life times fooland time that takes survey of all the worldmust have a stop O I could prophesybut that the earthy and cold hand of deathlies on my tongue no Percy thou art dustand food forfor worms brave Percy fare thee well great heartill-weaved ambition how much art thou shrunkwhen that this body did contain a spirita kingdom for it was too small a boundbut now two paces of the vilest earthis room enough this earth that bears thee deadbears not alive so stout a gentlemanif thou wert sensible of courtesyI should not make so dear a show of zealbut let my favours hide thy mangled faceand even in thy behalf iull thank myselffor doing these fair rites of tendernessadieu and take thy praise with thee to heaventhy ignomy sleep with thee in the gravebut not remembered in thy epitaphwhat old acquaintance could not all this fleshkeep in a little life poor Jack farewellI could have better spared a better manO I should have a heavy miss of theeif I were much in love with vanitydeath hath not struck so fat a deer to-daythough many dearer in this bloody frayembowelled will I see thee by and bytill then in blood by noble Percy lieembowelled if thou embowel me to-day iull give you leave to powder me and eat me too to-morrow Sblood itwas time to counterfeit or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit to die is to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed the better part of valour is discretion in the which better part I have saved my life Zounds I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead how if he should counterfeit too and rise by my faith I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit therefore iull make him sure yea and iull swear I killed him why may not he rise as well as I nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me therefore sirrah [stabbing him] with a new wound in your thigh come you along with mecome brother John full bravely hast thou fleshedthy maiden swordbut soft whom have we heredid you not tell me this fat man was deadI did I saw him deadbreathless and bleeding on the groundart thou alive or is it fantasythat plays upon our eyesight I prithee speakwe will not trust our eyes without our earsthou art not what thou seemestno thats certain I am not a double man but if I be not Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack there is Percyif your father will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next Percy himself I look to be either earl or duke I can assure youwhy Percy I killed myself and saw thee deaddidst thou lord lord how this world is given to lying I grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock if I may be believed so if not let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads iull take it upon my death I gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it zounds I would make him eat a piece of my swordthis is the strangest tale that eer I heardthis is the strangest fellow brother Johncome bring your luggage nobly on your backfor my part if a lie may do thee graceiull gild it with the happiest terms I havethe trumpet sounds retreat the day is ourscome brother let us to the highest of the fieldto see what friends are living who are deadiull follow as they say for reward he that rewards me God reward him if I do grow great iull grow less for iull purge and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should dothus ever did rebellion find rebukeill-spirited Worcester did we not send gracepardon and terms of love to all of youand wouldst thou turn our offers contrarymisuse the tenour of thy kinsmans trustthree knights upon our party slain to-daya noble earl and many a creature elsehad been alive this hourif like a christian thou hadst truly bornebetwixt our armies true intelligencewhat I have done my safety urged me toand I embrace this fortune patientlysince not to be avoided it falls on mebear Worcester to the death and Vernon tooother offenders we will pause uponhow goes the fieldthe noble Scot lord Douglas when he sawthe fortune of the day quite turned from himthe noble Percy slain and all his menupon the foot of fear fled with the restand falling from a hill he was so bruisedthat the pursuers took him At my tentthe Douglas is and I beseech your graceI may dispose of himwith all my heartthen brother John of Lancaster to youthis honourable bounty shall belonggo to the Douglas and deliver himup to his pleasure ransomless and freehis valour shown upon our crests to-dayhath taught us how to cherish such high deedseven in the bosom of our adversariesI thank your grace for this high courtesywhich I shall give away immediatelythen this remains that we divide our poweryou son John and my cousin Westmorelandtowards York shall bend you with your dearest speedto meet northumberland and the prelate Scroopwho as we hear are busily in armsmyself and you son Harry will towards Walesto fight with Glendower and the earl of marchrebellion in this land shall lose his swaymeeting the check of such another dayand since this business so fair is donelet us not leave till all our own be wonfiends appearing to La Pucellehung be the heavens with black yield day to nightcomets importing change of times and statesbrandish your crystal tresses in the skyand with them scourge the bad revolting starsthat have consented unto Henrys deathking Henry the fifth too famous to live longengland neer lost a king of so much worthengland neer had a king until his timevirtue he had deserving to commandhis brandished sword did blind men with his beamshis arms spread wider than a dragons wingshis sparkling eyes replete with wrathful firemore dazzled and drove back his enemiesthan mid-day sun fierce bent against their faceswhat should I say his deeds exceed all speechhe neer lift up his hand but conqueredwe mourn in black why mourn we not in bloodhenry is dead and never shall reviveupon a wooden coffin we attendand deaths dishonourable victorywe with our stately presence glorifylike captives bound to a triumphant carwhat shall we curse the planets of mishapthat plotted thus our glorys overthrowor shall we think the subtle-witted Frenchconjurers and sorcerers that afraid of himby magic verses have contrived his endhe was a king blessed of the king of kingsunto the French the dreadful judgment-dayso dreadful will not be as was his sightthe battles of the lord of hosts he foughtthe churchs prayers made him so prosperousthe church where is it Had not churchmen prayedhis thread of life had not so soon decayednone do you like but an effeminate princewhom like a school-boy you may over-awegloucester whateer we like thou art protectorand lookest to command the prince and realmthy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awemore than God or religious churchmen mayname not religion for thou lovest the fleshand neer throughout the year to church thou goestexcept it be to pray against thy foescease cease these jars and rest your minds in peacelets to the altar heralds wait on usinstead of gold well offer up our armssince arms avail not now that Henrys deadposterity await for wretched yearswhen at their mothers moist eyes babes shall suckour isle be made a marish of salt tearsand none but women left to wail the deadhenry the fifth thy ghost I invocateprosper this realm keep it from civil broilscombat with adverse planets in the heavensa far more glorious star thy soul will makethan Julius Ceasar or brightmy honourable lords health to you allsad tidings bring I to you out of Franceof loss of slaughter and discomfitureguienne Champaigne Rheims Orleansparis guysors Poictiers are all quite lostwhat sayst thou man before dead Henrys corsespeak softly or the loss of those great townswill make him burst his lead and rise from deathis Paris lost is Roan yielded upif Henry were recalled to life againthese news would cause him once more yield the ghosthow were they lost what treachery was usedno treachery but want of men and moneyamong the soldiers this is mutteredthat here you maintain several factionsand whilst a field should be dispatched and foughtyou are disputing of your generalsone would have lingering wars with little costanother would fly swift but wanteth wingsa third thinks without expense at allby guileful fair words peace may be obtainedawake awake English nobilitylet not sloth dim your honours new-begotcropped are the flower-de-luces in your armsof Englands coat one half is cut awaywere our tears wanting to this funeralthese tidings would call forth their flowing tidesme they concern Regent I am of Francegive me my steeled coat iull fight for Franceaway with these disgraceful wailing robeswounds will I lend the French instead of eyesto weep their intermissive miserieslords view these letters full of bad mischancefrance is revolted from the English quiteexcept some petty towns of no importthe Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheimsthe Bastard of Orleans with him is joinedreignier duke of Anjou doth take his partthe duke of Alen on flieth to his sidethe Dauphin crowned king all fly to himO whither shall we fly from this reproachwe will not fly but to our enemies throatsbedford if thou be slack iull fight it outgloucester why doubtest thou of my forwardnessan army have I mustered in my thoughtswherewith already France is overrunmy gracious lords to add to your lamentswherewith you now bedew king Henrys hearseI must inform you of a dismal fightbetwixt the stout lord Talbot and the Frenchwhat wherein Talbot overcame isit soO no wherein lord Talbot was oerthrownthe rcumstance iull tell you more at largethe tenth of August last this dreadful lordretiring from the siege of Orleanshaving full scarce six thousand in his troopby three-and-twenty thousand of the Frenchwas round encompassed and set uponno leisure had he to enrank his menhe wanted pikes to set before his archersinstead whereof sharp stakes plucked out of hedgesthey pitched in the ground confusedlyto keep the horsemen off from breaking inmore than three hours the fight continuedwhere valiant Talbot above human thoughtenacted wonders with his sword and lancehundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand himhere there and every where enraged he flewthe French exclaimed the devil was in armsall the whole army stood agazed on himhis soldiers spying his undaunted spirita Talbot a Talbot cried out amainand rushed into the bowels of the battlehere had the conquest fully been sealed upif sir John fastolfe had not played the cowardhe being in the vaward placed behindwith purpose to relieve and follow themcowardly fled not having struck one strokehence grew the general wrack and massacreenclosed were they with their enemiesa base Walloon to win the Dauphins gracethrust Talbot with a spear into the backwhom all France with their chief assembled strengthdurst not presume to look once in the faceis Talbot slain then I will slay myselffor living idly here in pomp and easewhilst such a worthy leader wanting aidunto his dastard foemen is betrayedO no he lives but is took prisonerand lord Scales with him and lord Hungerfordmost of the rest slaughtered or took likewisehis ransom there is none but I shall payiull hale the Dauphin headlong from his thronehis crown shall be the ransom of my friendfour of their lords iull change for one of oursfarewell my masters to my task will Ibonfires in France forthwith I am to maketo keep our great Saint Georges feast withalten thousand soldiers with me I will takewhose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quakeso you had need for Orleans is besiegedthe English army is grown weak and faintthe earl of Salisbury craveth supplyand hardly keeps his men from mutinysince they so few watch such a multituderemember lords your oaths to Henry sworneither to quell the Dauphin utterlyor bring him in obedience to your yokeI do remember it and here take my leaveto go about my preparationiull to the Tower with all the haste I canto view the artillery and munitionand then I will proclaim young Henry kingto Eltham will I where the young king isbeing ordained his speal governorand for his safety there iull best deviseeach hath his place and function to attendI am left out for me nothing remainsbut long I will not be Jack-out-of-officethe king from Eltham I intend to stealand sit at chiefest stern of public wealmars his true moving even as in the heavensso in the earth to this day is not knownlate did he shine upon the English sidenow we are victors upon us he smileswhat towns of any moment but we haveat pleasure here we lie near Orleansotherwhiles the famished English like pale ghostsfaintly besiege us one hour in a monththey want their porridge and their fat bull-beeveseither they must be dieted like mulesand have their provender tied to their mouthsor piteous they will look like drowned micelets raise the siege why live we idly heretalbot is taken whom we wont to fearremaineth none but mad-brained Salisburyand he may well in fretting spend his gallnor men nor money hath he to make warsound sound alarum we will rush on themnow for the honour of the forlorn Frenchhim I forgive my death that killeth mewhen he sees me go back one foot or flywho ever saw the like what men have Idogs cowards dastards I would neer have fledbut that they left me midst my enemiessalisbury is a desperate homidehe fighteth as one weary of his lifethe other lords like lions wanting fooddo rush upon us as their hungry preyfroissart a countryman of ours recordsengland all Olivers and Rowlands bredduring the time Edward the Third did reignmore truly now may this be verifiedfor none but Samsons and Goliasesit sendeth forth to skirmish one to tenlean raw-boned rascals who would eer supposethey had such courage and audatylets leave this town for they are hare-brained slavesand hunger will enforce them to be more eagerof old I know them rather with their teeththe walls theyll tear down than forsake the siegeI think by some odd gimmals or devicetheir arms are set like clocks still to strike onelse neer could they hold out so as they doby my consent well een let them alonebe it sowheres the prince Dauphin I have news for himbastard of Orleans thrice welcome to usmethinks your looks are sad your cheer appalledhath the late overthrow wrought this offencebe not dismayed for succour is at handa holy maid hither with me I bringwhich by a vision sent to her from heavenordained is to raise this tedious siegeand drive the English forth the bounds of Francethe spirit of deep prophecy she hathexceeding the nine sibyls of old Romewhats past and whats to come she can descryspeak shall I call her in believe my wordsfor they are certain and unfalliblego call her inbut first to try her skillreignier stand

let us banquet royallyafter this golden day of victorysirs take your places and be vigilantif any noise or soldier you perceivenear to the walls by some apparent signlet us have knowledge at the court of guardsergeant you shallthus are poor servitorswhen others sleep upon their quiet bedsconstrained to watch in darkness rain and coldlord regent and redoubted Burgundyby whose approach the regions of Artoiswalloon and Picardy are friends to usthis happy night the Frenchmen are securehaving all day caroused and banquetedembrace we then this opportunityas fitting best to quittance their deceitcontrived by art and baleful sorcerycoward of France how much he wrongs his famedespairing of his own arms fortitudeto join with witches and the help of helltraitors have never other companybut whats that Pucelle whom they term so purea maid they saya maid and be so martialpray God she prove not masculine ere longif underneath the standard of the Frenchshe carry armour as she hath begunwell let them practise and converse with spiritsgod is our fortress in whose conquering namelet us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarksascend brave Talbot we will follow theenot all together better far I guessthat we do make our entrance several waysthat if it chance the one of us do failthe other yet may rise against their forceagreed iull to yond cornerand I to thisand here will Talbot mount or make his gravenow Salisbury for thee and for the rightof English Henry shall this night appearhow much in duty I am bound to botharm arm the enemy doth make assaulthow now my lords what all unready sounready ay and glad we scaped so wellitwas time I trow to wake and leave our bedshearing alarums at our chamber-doorsof all exploits since first I followed armsneer heard I of a war-like enterprisemore venturous or desperate than thisI think this Talbot be a fiend of hellif not of hell the heavens sure favour himhere cometh Charles I marvel how he spedtut holy Joan was his defensive guardis this thy cunning thou deceitful damedidst thou at first to flatter us withalmake us partakers of a little gainthat now our loss might be ten times so muchwherefore is Charles impatient with his friendat all times will you have my power alikesleeping or waking must I still prevailor will you blame and lay the fault on meimprovident soldiers had your watch been goodthis sudden mischief never could have fallnduke of Alen on this was your defaultthat being captain of the watch to-nightdid look no better to that weighty chargehad all your quarters been so safely keptas that whereof I had the governmentwe had not been thus shamefully surprisedmine was secureand so was mine my lordand for myself most part of all this nightwithin her quarter and mine own prenctI was employed in passing to and froabout relieving of the sentinelsthen how or which way should they first break inquestion my lords no further of the casehow or which way itis sure they found some placebut weakly guarded where the breach was madeand now there rests no other shift but thisto gather our soldiers scattered and dispersedand lay new platforms to endamage themiull be so bold to take what they have leftthe cry of Talbot serves me for a swordfor I have loaden me with many spoilsusing no other weapon but his namethe day begins to break and night is fledwhose pitchy mantle over-veiled the earthhere sound retreat and cease our hot pursuitbring forth the body of old Salisburyand here advance it in the market-placethe middle centre of this cursed townnow have I paid my vow unto his soulfor every drop of blood was drawn from himthere hath at least five Frenchmen died to-nightand that hereafter ages may beholdwhat ruin happened in revenge of himwithin their chiefest temple iull erecta tomb wherein his corse shall be interredupon the which that every one may readshall be engraved the sack of Orleansthe treacherous manner of his mournful deathand what a terror he had been to Francebut lords in all our bloody massacreI muse we met not with the Dauphins gracehis new-come champion virtuous Joan of Arcnor any of his false confederatesitis thought lord Talbot when the fight beganroused on the sudden from their drowsy bedsthey did amongst the troops of armed menleap oer the walls for refuge in the fieldmyself as far as I could well discernfor smoke and dusky vapours of the nightam sure I scared the Dauphin and his trullwhen arm in arm they both came swiftly runninglike to a pair of loving turtle-dovesthat could not live asunder day or nightafter that things are set in order herewell follow them with all the power we haveall hail my lords Which of this princely traincall ye the war-like Talbot for his actsso much applauded through the realm of Francehere is the Talbot who would speak with himthe virtuous lady Countess of Auvergnewith modesty admiring thy renownby me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafeto visit her poor castle where she liesthat she may boast she hath beheld the manwhose glory fills the world with loud reportis it even so nay then I see our warswill turn into a peaceful comic sportwhen ladies crave to be encountered withyou may not my lord despise her gentle suitneer trust me then for when a world of mencould not prevail with all their oratoryyet hath a womans kindness over-ruledand therefore tell her I return great thanksand in submission will attend on herwill not your honours bear me companyno truly it is more than manners willand I have heard it said unbidden guestsare often welcomest when they are gonewell then alone since theres no remedyI mean to prove this ladys courtesycome hither captainyou perceive my mindI do my lord and mean accordinglyporter remember what I gave in chargeand when you have done so bring the keys to memadam I willthe plot is laid if all things fall out rightI shall as famous be by this exploitas Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus deathgreat is the rumour of this dreadful knightand his achievements of no less accountfain would mine eyes be witness with mine earsto give their censure of these rare reportsmadamaccording as your ladyship desiredby message craved so is lord Talbot comeand he is welcome what is this the manmadam it isis this the scourge of Franceis this the Talbot so much feared abroadthat with his name the mothers still their babesI see report is fabulous and falseI thought I should have seen some Herculesa second Hector for his grim aspectand large proportion of his strong-knit limbsalas this is a child a silly dwarfit cannot be this weak and writhled shrimpshould strike such terror to his enemiesmadam I have been bold to trouble youbut since your ladyship is not at leisureiull sort some other time to visit youwhat means he now go ask him whither he goesstay my lord Talbot for my lady cravesto know the cause of your abrupt departuremarry for that shes in a wrong beliefI go to certify her Talbots hereif thou be he then art thou prisonerprisoner to whomto me blood-thirsty lordand for that cause I trained thee to my houselong time thy shadow hath been thrall to mefor in my gallery thy picture hangsbut now the substance shall endure the likeand I will chain these legs and arms of thinethat hast by tyranny these many yearswasted our country slain our tizensand sent our sons and husbands captivateha ha halaughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moanI laugh to see your ladyship so fondto think that you have aught but Talbots shadowwhereon to practise your severitywhy art not thou the manI am indeedthen have I substance toono no I am but shadow of myselfyou are deceived my substance is not herefor what you see is but the smallest partand least proportion of humanityI tell you madam were the whole frame hereit is of such a spaous lofty pitchyour roof were not suffient to contain itthis is a riddling merchant for the noncehe will be here and yet he is not herehow can these contrarieties agreethat will I show you presentlyhow say you madam are you now persuadedthat Talbot is but shadow of himselfthese are his substance sinews arms and strengthwith which he yoketh your rebellious necksrazeth your ties and subverts your townsand in a moment makes them desolatevictorious Talbot pardon my abuseI find thou art no less than fame hath bruitedand more than may be gathered by thy shapelet my presumption not provoke thy wrathfor I am sorry that with reverenceI did not entertain thee as thou artbe not dismayed fair lady nor misconsterthe mind of Talbot as you did mistakethe outward composition of his bodywhat you have done hath not offended menor other satisfaction do I cravebut only with your patience that we maytaste of your wine and see what cates you havefor soldiers stomachs always serve them wellwith all my heart and think me honouredto feast so great a warrior in my housegreat lords and gentlemen what means this silencedare no man answer in a case of truthwithin the Temple hall we were too loudthe garden here is more convenientthen say at once if I maintained the truthor else was wrangling Somerset in the errorfaith I have been a truant in the lawand never yet could frame my will to itand therefore frame the law unto my willjudge you my lord of Warwick then between usbetween two hawks which flies the higher pitchbetween two dogs which hath the deeper mouthbetween two blades which bears the better temperbetween two horses which doth bear him bestbetween two girls which hath the merriest eyeI have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgmentbut in these nice sharp quillets of the lawgood faith I am no wiser than a dawtut tut here is a mannerly forbearancethe truth appears so naked on my sidethat any purblind eye may find it outand on my side it is so well apparelledso clear so shining and so evidentthat it will glimmer through a blind mans eyesince you are tongue-tied and so loath to speakin dumb significants proclaim your thoughtslet him that is a true-born gentlemanand stands upon the honour of his birthif he suppose that I have pleaded truthfrom off this brier pluck a white rose with melet him that is no coward nor no flattererbut dare maintain the party of the truthpluck a red rose from off this thorn with meI love no colours and without all colourof base insinuating flatteryI pluck this white rose with PlantagenetI pluck this red rose with young Somersetand say withal I think he held the rightstay lords and gentlemen and pluck no moretill you conclude that he upon whose sidethe fewest roses are cropped from the treeshall yield the other in the right opiniongood master Vernon it is well objectedif I have fewest I subscribe in silenceand Ithen for the truth and plainness of the caseI pluck this pale and maiden blossom heregiving my verdict on the white rose sideprick not your finger as you pluck it offlest bleeding you do paint the white rose redand fall on my side so against your willif I my lord for my opinion bleedopinion shall be surgeon to my hurtand keep me on the side where still I amwell well come on who elseunless my study and my books be falsethe argument you held was wrong in youin sign whereof I pluck a white rose toonow Somerset where is your argumenthere in my scabbard meditating thatshall dye your white rose in a bloody redmeantime your cheeks do counterfeit our rosesfor pale they look with fear as witnessingthe truth on our sideno Plantagenetitis not for fear but anger that thy cheeksblush for pure shame to counterfeit our rosesand yet thy tongue will not confess thy errorhath not thy rose a canker Somersethath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenetay sharp and pierng to maintain his truthwhiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehoodwell iull find friends to wear my bleeding rosesthat shall maintain what I have said is truewhere false Plantagenet dare not be seennow by this maiden blossom in my handI scorn thee and thy faction peevish boyturn not thy scorns this way Plantagenetproud Pole I will and scorn both him and theeiull turn my part thereof into thy throataway away good William de la Polewe grace the yeoman by conversing with himnow by Gods will thou wrongest him Somersethis grandfather was Lionel duke of Clarencethird son to the third Edward king of Englandspring crestless yeomen from so deep a roothe bears him on the places privilegeor durst not for his craven heart say thusby him that made me iull maintain my wordson any plot of ground in Christendomwas not thy father Richard earl of Cambridgefor treason executed in our late kings daysand by his treason standest not thou attaintedcorrupted and exempt from anent gentryhis trespass yet lives guilty in thy bloodand till thou be restored thou art a yeomanmy father was attached not attainedcondemned to die for treason but no traitorand that iull prove on better men than Somersetwere growing time once ripened to my willfor your partaker Pole and you yourselfiull note you in my book of memoryto scourge you for this apprehensionlook to it well and say you are well warnedah thou shalt find us ready for thee stilland know us by these colours for thy foesfor these my friends in spite of thee shall wearand by my soul this pale and angry roseas cognizance of my blood-drinking hatewill I for ever and my faction wearuntil it wither with me to my graveor flourish to the height of my degreego forward and be choked with thy ambitionand so farewell until I meet thee nexthave with thee Pole farewell ambitious Richardhow I am braved and must perforce endure itthis blot that they object against your houseshall be wiped out in the next parliamentcalled for the truce of winchester and Gloucesterand if thou be not then created YorkI will not live to be accounted Warwickmeantime in signal of my love to theeagainst proud Somerset and William Polewill I upon thy party wear this roseand here I prophesy this brawl to-daygrown to this faction in the Temple gardenshall send between the red rose and the whitea thousand souls to death and deadly nightgood master Vernon I am bound to youthat you on my behalf would pluck a flowerin your behalf still would I wear the sameand so will Ithanks gentle sircome let us four to dinner I dare saythis quarrel will drink blood another daykind keepers of my weak decaying agelet dying Mortimer here rest himselfeven like a man new haled from the rackso fare my limbs with long imprisonmentand these gray locks the pursuivants of deathnestor-like aged in an age of careargue the end of Edmund Mortimerthese eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spentwax dim as drawing to their exigentweak shoulders overborne with burdening griefand pithless arms like to a withered vinethat droops his sapless branches to the groundyet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numbunable to support this lump of clayswift-winged with desire to get a graveas witting I no other comfort havebut tell me keeper will my nephew comerichard Plantagenet my lord will comewe sent unto the Temple unto his chamberand answer was returned that he will comeenough my soul shall then be satisfiedpoor gentleman his wrong doth equal minesince Henry Monmouth first began to reignbefore whose glory I was great in armsthis loathsome sequestration have I hadand even since then hath Richard been obscureddeprived of honour and inheritancebut now the arbitrator of despairsjust death kind umpire of mens miserieswith sweet enlargement doth dismiss me henceI would his troubles likewise were expiredthat so he might recover what was lostmy lord your loving nephew now is comerichard Plantagenet my friend is he comeay noble uncle thus ignobly usedyour nephew late despised Richard comesdirect mine arms I may embrace his neckand in his bosom spend my latter gaspO tell me when my lips do touch his cheeksthat I may kindly give one fainting kissand now declare sweet stem from Yorks great stockwhy didst thou say of late thou wert despisedfirst lean thine aged back against mine armand in that ease iull tell thee my diseasethis day in argument upon a casesome words there grew btwixt Somerset and meamong which terms he used a lavish tongueand did upbraid me with my fathers deathwhich obloquy set bars before my tongueelse with the like I had requited himtherefore good uncle for my fathers sakein honour of a true Plantagenetand for alliance sake declare the causemy father earl of Cambridge lost his headthat cause fair nephew that imprisoned meand hath detained me all my flowring youthwithin a loathsome dungeon there to pinewas cursed instrument of his deceasediscover more at large what cause that wasfor I am ignorant and cannot guessI will if that my fading breath permitand death approach not ere my tale be donehenry the fourth grandfather to this kingdeposed his nephew Richard Edwards sonthe first-begotten and the lawful heirof Edward king the third of that descentduring whose reign the Peres of the northfinding his usurpation most unjustendeavoured my advancement to the thronethe reason moved these warlike lords to thiswas for that young king Richard thus removedleaving no heir begotten of his bodyI was the next by birth and parentagefor by my mother I derived amfrom Lionel duke of Clarence the third sonto king Edward the Third whereas hefrom John of gaunt doth bring his pedigreebeing but fourth of that heroic linebut mark as in this haughty great attemptthey laboured to plant the rightful heirI lost my liberty and they their liveslong after this when Henry the fifthsucceeding his father Bolingbroke did reignthy father earl of Cambridge then derivedfrom famous Edmund Langley duke of Yorkmarrying my sister that thy mother wasagain in pity of my hard distresslevied an army weening to redeemand have installed me in the diadembut as the rest so fell that noble earland was beheaded thus the Mortimersin whom the title rested were suppressedof which my lord your honour is the lasttrue and thou seest that I no issue haveand that my fainting words do warrant deaththou art my heir the rest I wish thee gatherbut yet be wary in thy studious carethy grave admonishments prevail with mebut yet methinks my fathers executionwas nothing less than bloody tyrannywith silence nephew be thou politicstrong-fixed is the house of Lancasterand like a mountain not to be removedbut now thy uncle is removing henceas princes do their courts when they are cloyedwith long continuance in a settled placeO uncle would some part of my young yearsmight but redeem the passage of your agethou dost then wrong me as the slaughterer dothwhich giveth many wounds when one will killmourn not except thou sorrow for my goodonly give order for my funeraland so farewell and fair be all thy hopesand prosperous be thy life in peace and warand peace no war befall thy parting soulin prison hast thou spent a pilgrimageand like a hermit overpassed thy dayswell I will lock his counsel in my breastand what I do imagine let that restkeepers convey him hence and I myselfwill see his burial better than his lifehere dies the dusky torch of Mortimerchoked with ambition of the meaner sortand for those wrongs those bitter injurieswhich Somerset hath offered to my houseI doubt not but with honour to redressand therefore

pernious usurerfroward by nature enemy to peacelasvious wanton more than well beseemsa man of thy profession and degreeand for thy treachery whats more manifestin that thou laidest a trap to take my lifeas well at London Bridge as at the Towerbeside I fear me if thy thoughts were siftedthe king thy sovreign is not quite exemptfrom envious malice of thy swelling heartgloucester I do defy thee lords vouchsafeto give me hearing what I shall replyif I were covetous ambitious or perverseas he will have me how am I so pooror how haps it I seek not to advanceor raise myself but keep my wonted callingand for dissension who preferreth peacemore than I do except I be provokedno my good lords it is not that offendsit is not that that hath incensed the dukeit is because no one should sway but heno one but he should be about the kingand that engenders thunder in his breastand makes him roar these accusations forthbut he shall know I am as goodas goodthou bastard of my grandfatheray lordly sir for what are you I praybut one imperious in anothers throneam I not protector saucy priestand am not I a prelate of the churchyes as an outlaw in a castle keepsand useth

bishop be not overbornemethinks my lord should be religiousand know the office that belongs to suchmethinks his lordship should be humblerit fitteth not a prelate so to pleadyes when his holy state is touched so nearstate holy or unhallowed what of thatis not his grace protector to the kingplantagenet I see must hold his tonguelest it be said speak sirrah when you shouldmust your bold verdict enter talk with lords else would I have a fling at winchesteruncles of Gloucester and of winchesterthe speal watchmen of our English wealI would prevail if prayers might prevailto join your hearts in love and amityO what a scandal is it to our crownthat two such noble peers as ye should jarbelieve me lords my tender years can tellvil dissension is a viperous wormthat gnaws the bowels of the commonwealthwhat tumults thisan uproar I dare warrantbegun through malice of the bishops menO my good lords and virtuous Henrypity the ty of London pity usthe bishop and the duke of Gloucesters menforbidden late to carry any weaponhave filled their pockets full of pebble stonesand banding themselves in contrary partsdo pelt so fast at one anothers patethat many have their giddy brains knocked outour windows are broke down in every streetand we for fear compelled to shut our shopswe charge you on allegiance to ourselfto hold your slaughtring hands and keep the peacepray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strifenay if we be forbidden stones well fall to it with our teethdo what ye dare we are as resoluteyou of my household leave this peevish broiland set this unaccustomed fight asidemy lord we know your grace to be a manjust and upright and for your royal birthinferior to none but to his majestyand ere that we will suffer such a princeso kind a father of the commonwealto be disgraced by an inkhorn matewe and our wives and children all will fightand have our bodies slaughtred by thy foesay and the very parings of our nailsshall pitch a field when we are deadstay stay I sayand if you love me as you say you dolet me persuade you to forbear a whileO how this discord doth afflict my soulcan you my lord of winchester beholdmy sighs

you mean with obstinate repulseto slay your sovreign and destroy the realmyou see what mischief and what murder toohath been enacted through your enmitythen be at peace except ye thirst for bloodhe shall submit or I will never yieldcompassion on the king commands me stoopor I would see his heart out ere the priestshould ever get that privilege of mebehold my lord of winchester the dukehath banished moody discontented furyas by his smoothed brows it doth appearwhy look you still so stern and tragicalhere winchester I offer thee my handfie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preachthat malice was a great and grievous sinand will not you maintain the thing you teachbut prove a chief offender in the samesweet king the bishop hath a kindly girdfor shame my lord of winchester relentwhat shall a child instruct you what to dowell duke of Gloucester I will yield to theelove for thy love and hand for hand I giveay but I fear me with a hollow heartsee here my friends and loving countrymenthis token serveth for a flag of trucebetwixt ourselves and all our followersso help me God as I dissemble notso help me God as I intend it notO loving uncle kind duke of Gloucesterhow joyful am I made by this contractaway my masters trouble us no morebut join in friendship as your lords have donecontent iull to the surgeonsand so will Iand I will see what physic the tavern affordsaccept this scroll most gracious sovereignwhich in the right of Richard Plantagenetwe do exhibit to your majestywell urged my lord of Warwick for sweet princean if your grace mark every rcumstanceyou have great reason to do Richard rightespeally for those occasionsat Eltham-place I told your majestyand those occasions uncle were of forcetherefore my loving lords our pleasure isthat Richard be restored to his bloodlet Richard be restored to his bloodso shall his fathers wrongs be recompensedas will the rest so willeth winchesterif Richard will be true not that alonebut all the whole inheritance I givethat doth belong unto the house of Yorkfrom whence you spring by lineal descentthy humble servant vows obedienceand humble service till the point of deathstoop then and set your knee against my footand in reguerdon of that duty doneI girt thee with the valiant sword of Yorkrise Richard like a true Plantagenetand rise created princely duke of Yorkand so thrive Richard as thy foes may falland as my duty springs so perish theythat grudge one thought against your majestywelcome high prince the mighty duke of Yorkperish base prince ignoble duke of Yorknow will it best avail your majestyto cross the seas and to be crowned in Francethe presence of a king engenders loveamongst his subjects and his loyal friendsas it disanimates his enemieswhen Gloucester says the word king Henry goesfor friendly counsel cuts off many foesyour ships already are in readinessay we may march in England or in Francenot seeing what is likely to ensuethis late dissension grown betwixt the peersburns under feigned ashes of forged loveand will at last break out into a flameas festered members rot but by degreetill bones and flesh and sinews fall awayso will this base and envious discord breedand now I fear that fatal prophecywhich in the time of Henry named the fifthwas in the mouth of every sucking babethat Henry born at Monmouth should win alland Henry born at windsor should lose allwhich is so plain that Exeter doth wishhis days may finish ere that hapless timethese are the ty gates the gates of Roanthrough which our policy must make a breachtake heed be wary how you place your wordstalk like the vulgar sort of market-menthat come to gather money for their cornif we have entrance as I hope we shalland that we find the slothful watch but weakiull by a sign give notice to our friendsthat Charles the Dauphin may encounter themour sacks shall be a mean to sack the tyand we be lords and rulers over Roantherefore well knockquI est lpaisans pauvres gens de Francepoor market-folks that come to sell their cornenter go in the market-bell is rungnow Roan iull shake thy bulwarks to the groundsaint Denis bless this happy stratagemand once again well sleep secure in Roanhere entered Pucelle and her practisantsnow she is there how will she spefywhere is the best and safest passage inby thrusting out a torch from yonder towerwhich once discerned shows that her meaning isno way to that for weakness which she enteredbehold this is the happy wedding torchthat joineth Roan unto her countrymenbut burning fatal to the Talbotitessee noble Charles the beacon of our friendthe burning torch in yonder turret standsnow shine it like a comet of revengea prophet to the fall of all our foesdefer no time delays have dangerous endsenter and cry the Dauphin presentlyand then do execution on the watchfrance thou shalt rue this treason with thy tearsif Talbot but survive thy treacherypucelle that witch that damned sorceresshath wrought this hellish mischief unawaresthat hardly we escaped the pride of Francegood morrow gallants Want ye corn for breadI think the duke of Burgundy will fastbefore hell buy again at such a rateitwas full of darnel do you like the tastescoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezanI trust ere long to choke thee with thine ownand make thee curse the harvest of that cornyour grace may starve perhaps before that timeO let no words but deeds revenge this treasonwhat will you do good grey-beard break a lanceand run a tilt at death within a chairfoul fiend of France and hag of all despiteencompassed with thy lustful paramoursbecomes it thee to taunt his valiant ageand twit with cowardice a man half deaddamsel iull have a bout with you againor else let Talbot perish with this shameare you so hot sir yet Pucelle hold thy peaceif Talbot do but thunder rain will followgod speed the parliament who shall be the speakerdare ye come forth and meet us in the fieldbelike your lordship takes us then for foolsto try if that our own be ours or noI speak not to that railing Hecatebut unto thee Alen on and the restwill ye like soldiers come and fight it outsignior nosignior hang base muleters of Francelike peasant foot-boys do they keep the wallsand dare not take up arms like gentlemenaway captains lets get us from the wallsfor Talbot means no-goodness by his looksgod be wityou my lord we came but to tell youthat we are hereand there will we be too ere it be longor else reproach be Talbots greatest famevow Burgundy by honour of thy housepricked on by public wrongs sustained in Franceeither to get the town again or dieand I as sure as English Henry livesand as his father here was conqueroras sure as in this late-betrayed towngreat Cur-de-lions heart was buriedso sure I swear to get the town or diemy vows are equal partners with thy vowsbut ere we go regard this dying princethe valiant duke of Bedford come my lordwe will bestow you in some better placefitter for sickness and for crazy agelord Talbot do not so dishonour mehere will I sit before the walls of Roanand will be partner of your weal or woecourageous Bedford let us now persuade younot to be gone from hence for once I readthat stout Pendragon in his litter sickcame to the field and vanquished his foesmethinks I should revive the soldiers heartsbecause I ever found them as myselfundaunted spirit in a dying breastthen be it so heavens keep old Bedford safeand now no more ado brave Burgundybut gather we our forces out of handand set upon our boasting enemywhither away sir John fastolfe in such hastewhither away to save myself by flightwe are like to have the overthrow againwhat will you fly and leave lord Talbotayall the Talbots in the world to save my lifecowardly knight ill fortune follow theenow quiet soul depart when Heaven pleasefor I have seen our enemies overthrowwhat is the trust or strength of foolish manthey that of late were daring with their scoffsare glad and fain by flight to save themselveslost and recovered in a day againthis is a double honour Burgundyyet heavens have glory for this victorywarlike and martial Talbot Burgundyenshrines thee in his heart and there erectsthy noble deeds as valours monumentthanks gentle duke but where is Pucelle nowI think her old familiar is asleepnow wheres the Bastards braves and Charles his gleekswhat all amort Roan hangs her head for griefthat such a valiant company are flednow will we take some order in the townplang therein some expert officersand then depart to Paris to the kingfor there young Henry with his nobles liewhat wills lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundybut yet before we go lets not forgetthe noble duke of Bedford late deceasedbut see his exequies fulfilled in Roana braver soldier never couched lancea gentler heart did never sway in courtbut kings and mightiest potentates must diefor thats the end of human miserydismay not princes at this acdentnor grieve that Roan is so recoveredcare is no cure but rather corrosivefor things that are not to be remediedlet frantic Talbot triumph for a whileand like a peacock sweep along his tailwell pull his plumes and take away his trainif Dauphin and the rest will be but ruledwe have been guided by thee hithertoand of thy cunning had no diffidenceone sudden foil shall never breed distrustsearch out thy wit for secret poliesand we will make thee famous through the worldwell set thy statue in some holy placeand have thee reverenced like a blessed saintemploy thee then sweet virgin for our goodthen thus it must be this doth Joan deviseby fair persuasions mixed with sugared wordswe will entice the duke of Burgundyto leave the Talbot and to follow usay marry sweeting if we could do thatfrance were no place for Henrys warriorsnor should that nation boast it so with usbut be extirped from our provincesfor ever should they be expulsed from Franceand not have title of an earldom hereyour honours shall perceive how I will workto bring this matter to the wished endhark by the sound of drum you may perceivetheir powers are marching unto Paris-wardthere goes the Talbot with his colours spreadand all the troops of English after himnow in the rearward comes the duke and hisfortune in favour makes him lag behindsummon a parley we will talk with hima parley with the duke of Burgundywho craves a parley with the Burgundythe princely Charles of France thy countrymanwhat sayst thou Charles for I am marching hencespeak Pucelle and enchant him with thy wordsbrave Burgundy undoubted hope of Francestay let thy humble handmaid speak to theespeak on but be not over-tediouslook on thy country look on fertile Franceand see the ties and the towns defacedby wasting ruin of the cruel foeas looks the mother on her lowly babewhen death doth close his tender dying eyessee see the pining malady of Francebehold the wounds the most unnatural woundswhich thou thyself hast givn her woeful breastO turn thy edged sword another waystrike those that hurt and hurt not those that helpone drop of blood drawn from thy countrys bosomshould grieve thee more than streams of foreign gorereturn thee therefore with a flood of tearsand wash away thy countrys stained spotseither she hath bewitched me with her wordsor nature makes me suddenly relentbesides all French and France exclaims on theedoubting thy birth and lawful progenywho joinest thou with but with a lordly nationthat will not trust thee but for profits sakewhen Talbot hath set footing once in Franceand fashioned thee that instrument of illwho then but English Henry will be lordand thou be thrust out like a fugitivecall we to mind and mark but this for proofwas not the duke of Orleans thy foeand was he not in England prisonerbut when they heard he was thine enemythey set him free without his ransom paidin spite of Burgundy and all his friendssee then thou fightest against thy countrymenand joinest with them will be thy slaughtermencome come return return thou wandring lordcharles and the rest will take thee in their armsI am vanquished these haughty words of hershave battered me like roaring cannon-shotand made me almost yield upon my kneesforgive me country and sweet countrymenand lords accept this hearty kind embracemy forces and my power of men are yoursso farewell Talbot iull no longer trust theedone like a Frenchman turn and turn againwelcome brave duke thy friendship makes us freshand doth beget new courage in our breastspucelle hath bravely played her part in thisand doth deserve a coronet of goldnow let us on my lords and join our powersand seek how we may prejudice the foemy gracious prince and honourable peershearing of your arrival in this realmI have a while givn truce unto my warsto do my duty to my sovereignin sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimedto your obedience fifty fortressestwelve ties and seven walled towns of strengthbeside five hundred prisoners of esteemlets fall his sword before your highness feetand with submissive loyalty of heartascribes the glory of his conquest gotfirst to my God and next unto your graceis this the lord Talbot uncle Gloucesterthat hath so long been resident in Franceyes if it please your majesty my liegewelcome brave captain and victorious lordwhen I was young as yet I am not oldI do remember how my father saida stouter champion never handled swordlong since we were resolved of your truthyour faithful service and your toil in waryet never have you tasted our rewardor been reguerdoned with so much as thanksbecause till now we never saw your facetherefore stand up and for these good desertswe here create you earl of Shrewsburyand in our coronation take your placenow sir to you that were so hot at seadisgrang of these colours that I wearin honour of my noble lord of Yorkdarest thou maintain the former words thou spakestyes sir as well as you dare patronagethe envious barking of your saucy tongueagainst my lord the duke of Somersetsirrah thy lord I honour as he iswhy what is he as good a man as Yorkhark ye not so in witness take ye thatvillain thou knowest the law of arms is suchthat whoso draws a sword itis present deathor else this blow should broach thy dearest bloodbut iull unto his majesty and craveI may have liberty to venge this wrongwhen thou shalt see iull meet thee to thy costwell miscreant iull be there as soon as youand after meet you sooner than you wouldlord bishop set the crown upon his headgod save king Henry of that name the sixthnow Governor of Paris take your oaththat you elect no other king but himesteem none friends but such as are his friendsand none your foes but such as shall pretendmalious practices against his statethis shall ye do so help you righteous Godmy gracious sovereign as I rode from Calaisto haste unto your coronationa letter was delivered to my handswrit to your grace from the duke of Burgundyshame to the duke of Burgundy and theeI vowed base knight when I did meet thee nextto tear the garter from thy cravens legwhich I have done because unworthilythou wast installed in that high degreepardon me princely Henry and the restthis dastard at the battle of Pataywhen but in all I was six thousand strongand that the French were almost ten to onebefore we met or that a stroke was givenlike to a trusty squire did run awayin which assault we lost twelve hundred menmyself and divers gentlemen besidewere there surprised and taken prisonersthen judge great lords if I have done amissor whether that such cowards ought to wearthis ornament of knighthood yea or noto say the truth this fact was infamousand ill beseeming any common manmuch more a knight a captain and a leaderwhen first this order was ordained my lordsknights of the garter were of noble birthvaliant and virtuous full of haughty couragesuch as were grown to credit by the warsnot fearing death nor shrinking for distressbut always resolute in most extremeshe then that is not furnished in this sortdoth but usurp the sacred name of knightprofaning this most honourable orderand should if I were worthy to be judgebe quite degraded like a hedge-born swainthat doth presume to boast of gentle bloodstain to thy countrymen thou hearest thy doombe packing therefore thou that wast a knighthenceforth we banish thee on pain of deathand now my lord Protector view the lettersent from our uncle duke of Burgundywhat means his grace that he hath changed his styleno more but plain and bluntly to the kinghath he forgot he is his sovereignor doth this churlish superscriptionpretend some alteration in good willwhats here I have upon espeal causemoved with compassion of my countrys wracktogether with the pitiful complaintsof such as your oppression feeds uponforsaken your pernious factionand joined with Charles the rightful king of FranceO monstrous treachery can this be sothat in alliance amity and oathsthere should be found such false dissembling guilewhat doth my uncle Burgundy revolthe doth my lord and is become your foeis that the worst this letter doth containit is the worst and all my lord he writeswhy then lord Talbot there shall talk with himand give him chastisement for this abusehow say you my lord are you not contentcontent my liege yes but that I am preventedI should have begged I might have been employedthen gather strength and march unto him straightlet him perceive how ill we brook his treasonand what offence it is to flout his friendsI go my lord in heart desiring stillyou may behold confusion of your foesgrant me the combat gracious sovereignand me my lord grant me the combat toothis is my servant hear him noble princeand this is mine sweet Henry favour himbe patient lords and give them leave to speaksay gentlemen what makes you thus exclaimand wherefore crave you combat or with whomwith him my lord for he hath done me wrongand I with him for he hath done me wrongwhat is that wrong whereof you both complainfirst let me know and then iull answer youcrossing the sea from England into Francethis fellow here with envious carping tongueupbraided me about the rose I wearsaying the sanguine colour of the leavesdid represent my masters blushing cheekswhen stubbornly he did repugn the truthabout a certain question in the lawargued betwixt the duke of York and himwith other vile and ignominious termsin confutation of which rude reproachand in defence of my lords worthinessI crave the benefit of law of armsand that is my petition noble lordfor though he seem with forged quaint conceitto set a gloss upon his bold intentyet know my lord I was provoked by himand he first took exceptions at this badgepronounng that the paleness of this flowerbewrayed the faintness of my masters heartwill not this malice Somerset be leftyour private grudge my lord of York will outthough neer so cunningly you smother itgood lord what madness rules in brain-sick menwhen for so slight and frivolous a causesuch factious emulations shall arisegood cousins both of York and Somersetquiet yourselves I pray and be at peacelet this dissension first be tried by fightand then your highness shall command a peacethe quarrel toucheth none but us alonebetwixt ourselves let us dede it thenthere is my pledge accept it Somersetnay let it rest where it began at firstconfirm it so mine honourable lordconfirm it so Confounded be your strifeand perish ye with your audaous pratepresumptuous vassals are you not ashamedwith this immodest clamorous outrageto trouble and disturb the king and usand you my lords methinks you do not wellto bear with their perverse objectionsmuch less to take occasion from their mouthsto raise a mutiny betwixt yourselveslet me persuade you take a better courseit grieves his highness good my lords be friendscome hither you that would be combatantshenceforth I charge you as you love our favourquite to forget this quarrel and the causeand you my lords remember where we arein France amongst a fickle wavring nationif they perceive dissension in our looksand that within ourselves we disagreehow will their grudging stomachs be provokedto wilful disobedience and rebelbeside what infamy will there arisewhen foreign princes shall be certifiedthat for a toy a thing of no regardking Henrys peers and chief nobilitydestroyed themselves and lost the realm of FranceO think upon the conquest of my fathermy tender years and let us not foregothat for a trifle that was bought with bloodlet me be umpire in this doubtful strifeI see no reason if I wear this rosethat any one should therefore be suspiousI more incline to Somerset than Yorkboth are my kinsmen and I love them bothas well they may upbraid me with my crownbecause forsooth the king of Scots is crownedbut your discretions better can persuadethan I am able to instruct or teachand therefore as we hither came in peaceso let us still continue peace and lovecousin of York we institute your graceto be our regent in these parts of Franceand good my lord of Somerset uniteyour troops of horsemen with his bands of footand like true subjects sons of your progenitorsgo cheerfully together and digestyour angry choler on your enemiesourself my lord Protector and the restafter some respite will return to Calaisfrom thence to England where I hope ere longto be presented by your victorieswith Charles Alen on and that traitorous routmy lord of York I promise you the king Prettily methought did play the oratorand so he did but yet I like it notin that he wears the badge of Somersettush that was but his fancy blame him notI dare presume sweet prince he thought no harman if I wist he did but let it restother affairs must now be managedwell didst thou Richard to suppress thy voicefor had the passions of thy heart burst outI fear we should have seen dephered theremore rancorous spite more furious raging broilsthan yet can be imagined or supposedbut howsoeer no simple man that seesthis jarring discord of nobilitythis shouldering of each other in the courtthis factious bandying of their favouritesbut that it doth presage some ill eventitis much when sceptres are in childrens handsbut more when envy breeds unkind divisionthere comes the ruin there begins confusiongo to the gates of Bourdeaux trumpetersummon their general unto the wallenglish John Talbot captains calls you forthservant in arms to Harry king of Englandand thus he would open your ty gatesbe humble to us call my sovreign yoursand do him homage as obedient subjectsand iull withdraw me and my bloody powerbut if you frown upon this proffered peaceyou tempt the fury of my three attendantslean famine quartering steel and climbing firewho in a moment even with the earthshall lay your stately and air-braving towersif you forsake the offer of their lovethou ominous and fearful owl of deathour nations terror and their bloody scourgethe period of thy tyranny approachethon us thou canst not enter but by deathfor I protest we are well fortifiedand strong enough to issue out and fightif thou retire the Dauphin well appointedstands with the snares of war to tangle theeon either hand thee there are squadrons pitchedto wall thee from the liberty of flightand no way canst thou turn thee for redressbut death doth front thee with apparent spoiland pale destruction meets thee in the faceten thousand French have taen the sacramentto rive their dangerous artilleryupon no christian soul but English Talbotlo there thou standest a breathing valiant manof an invinble unconquered spiritthis is the latest glory of thy praisethat I thy enemy edue thee withalfor ere the glass that now begins to runfinish the process of his sandy hourthese eyes that see thee now well colouredshall see thee withered bloody pale and deadhark hark the Dauphins drum a warning bellsings heavy music to thy timorous souland mine shall ring thy dire departure outhe fables not I hear the enemyout some light horsemen and peruse their wingsO negligent and heedless displinehow are we parked and bounded in a palea little herd of Englands timorous deermazed with a yelping kennel of French cursif we be English deer be then in bloodnot rascal-like to fall down with a pinchbut rather moody-mad and desperate stagsturn on the bloody hounds with heads of steeland make the cowards stand aloof at baysell every man his life as dear as mineand they shall find dear deer of us my friendsgod and Saint George Talbot and Englands rightprosper our colours in this dangerous fightare not the speedy scouts returned againthat dogged the mighty army of the Dauphinthey are returned my lord and give it outthat he is marched to Bourdeaux with his powerto fight with Talbot as he marched alongby your espials were discoveredtwo mightier troops than that the Dauphin ledwhich joined with him and made their march for Bourdeauxa plague upon that villain Somersetthat thus delays my promised supplyof horsemen that were levied for this siegerenowned Talbot doth expect my aidand I am louted by a traitor villainand cannot help the noble chevaliergod comfort him in this necessityif he miscarry farewell wars in Francethou princely leader of our English strengthnever so needful on the earth of Francespur to the rescue of the noble Talbotwho now is girdled with a waist of ironand hemmed about with grim destructionto Bourdeaux war-like duke to Bourdeaux Yorkelse farewell Talbot France and Englands honourO God that Somerset who in proud heartdoth stop my cornets were in Talbots placeso should we save a valiant gentlemanby forfeiting a traitor and a cowardmad ire and wrathful fury make me weepthat thus we die while remiss traitors sleepO send some succour to the distressed lordhe dies we lose I break my war-like wordwe mourn France smiles we lose they daily getall long of this vile traitor Somersetthen God take mercy on brave Talbots souland on his son young John whom two hours sinceI met in travel toward his war-like fatherthis seven years did not Talbot see his sonand now they meet where both their lives are donealas what joy shall noble Talbot haveto bid his young son welcome to his graveaway vexation almost stops my breaththat sundered friends greet in the hour of deathlucy farewell no more my fortune canbut curse the cause I cannot aid the manmaine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won awaylong all of Somerset and his delaythus while the vulture of seditionfeeds in the bosom of such great commanderssleeping neglection doth betray to lossthe conquest of our scarce cold conquerorthat ever living man of memoryhenry the fifth whiles they each other crosslives honours lands and all hurry to lossit is too late I cannot send them nowthis expedition was by York and Talbottoo rashly plotted all our general forcemight with a sally of the very townbe buckled with the over-daring Talbothath sullied all his gloss of former honourby this unheedful desperate wild adventureYork set him on to fight and die in shamethat Talbot dead great York might bear the namehere is sir William Lucy who with meset from our oermatched forces forth for aidhow now sir William whither were you sentwhither my lord from bought and sold lord Talbotwho ringed about with bold adversitycries out for noble York and Somersetto beat assailing death from his weak legionsand whiles the honourable captain theredrops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbsand in advantage lingering looks for rescueyou his false hopes the trust of Englands honourkeep off aloof with worthless emulationlet not your private discord keep awaythe levied succours that should lend him aidwhile he renowned noble gentlemanyields up his life unto a world of oddsorleans the Bastard Charles Burgundyalen on Reignier compass him aboutand Talbot perisheth by your defaultYork set him on York should have sent him aidand York as fast upon your grace exclaimsswearing that you withhold his levied hostcollected for this expeditionYork lies he might have sent and had the horseI owe him little duty and less loveand take foul scorn to fawn on him by sendingthe fraud of England not the force of Francehath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbotnever

slainfor fly he could not if he would have fledand fly would Talbot never though he mightif he be dead brave Talbot then adieuhis fame lives in the world his shame in youO young John Talbot I did send for theeto tutor thee in stratagems of warthat Talbots name might be in thee revivedwhen sapless age and weak unable limbsshould bring thy father to his drooping chairbut O malignant and ill-boding starsnow thou art come unto a feast of deatha terrible and unavoided dangertherefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horseand iull direct thee how thou shalt escapeby sudden flight come dally not be goneis my name Talbot and am I your sonand shall I fly O if you love my motherdishonour not her honourable nameto make a bastard and a slave of methe world will say he is not Talbots bloodthat basely fled when noble Talbot stoodfly to revenge my death if I be slainhe that flies so will neer return againif we both stay we both are sure to diethen let me stay and father do you flyyour loss is great so your regard should bemy worth unknown no loss is known in meupon my death the French can little boastin yours they will in you all hopes are lostflight cannot stain the honour you have wonbut mine it will that no exploit have doneyou fled for vantage everyone will swearbut if I bow theyll say it was for fearthere is no hope that ever I will stayif the first hour I shrink and run awayhere on my knee I beg mortalityrather than life preserved with infamyshall all thy mothers hopes lie in one tombay rather than iull shame my mothers wombupon my blessing I command thee goto fight I will but not to fly the foepart of thy father may be saved in theeno part of him but will be shame in methou never hadst renown nor canst not lose ityes your renowned name shall flight abuse itthy fathers charge shall clear thee from that stainyou cannot witness for me being slainif death be so apparent then both flyand leave my followers here to fight and diemy age was never tainted with such shameand shall my youth be guilty of such blameno more can I be severed from your sidethan can yourself yourself in twain dividestay go do what you will the

to heaven flysaint George and victory fight soldiers fightthe regent hath with Talbot broke his wordand left us to the rage of France his swordwhere is John Talbot Pause and take thy breathI gave thee life and rescued thee from deathO twice my father twice am I thy sonthe life thou gavest me first was lost and donetill with thy war-like sword despite of fateto my determined time thou gavest new datewhen from the Dauphins crest thy sword struck fireit warmed thy fathers heart with proud desireof bold-faced victory then leaden agequickened with youthful spleen and war-like ragebeat down Alen on Orleans Burgundyand from the pride of gallia rescued theethe ireful bastard Orleans that drew bloodfrom thee my boy and had the maidenhoodof thy first fight I soon encounteredand interchanging blows I quickly shedsome of his bastard blood and in disgracebespoke him thus Contaminated baseand misbegotten blood I spill of thinemean and right poor for that pure blood of minewhich thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy here purposing the Bastard to destroycame in strong rescue speak thy fathers careart thou not weary John how dost thou farewilt thou yet leave the battle boy and flynow thou art sealed the son of chivalryfly to revenge my death when I am deadthe help of one stands me in little steadO too much folly is it well I wotto hazard all our lives in one small boatif I to-day die not with Frenchmens rageto-morrow I shall die with mickle ageby me they nothing gain an if I stayitis but the shortning of my life one dayin thee thy mother dies our households namemy deaths revenge thy youth and Englands fameall these and more we hazard by thy stayall these are saved if thou wilt fly awaythe sword of Orleans hath not made me smartthese words of yours draw life-blood from my hearton that advantage bought with such a shameto save a paltry life and slay bright famebefore young Talbot from old Talbot flythe coward horse that bears me fall and dieand like me to the peasant boys of Franceto be shames scorn and subject of mischancesurely by all the glory you have wonan if I fly I am not Talbots sonthen talk no more of flight it is no bootif son to Talbot die at Talbots footthen follow thou thy desperate sire of Cretethou Icarus thy life to me is sweetif thou wilt fight fight by thy fathers sideand commendable proved lets die in pridewhere is my other life mine own is goneO wheres young Talbot where is valiant Johntriumphant death smeared with captivityyoung Talbots valour makes me smile at theewhen he perceived me shrink and on my kneehis bloody sword he brandished over meand like a hungry lion did commencerough deeds of rage and stern impatiencebut when my angry guardant stood alonetendering my ruin and assailed of nonedizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heartsuddenly made him from my side to startinto the clustring battle of the Frenchand in that sea of blood my boy did drenchhis overmounting spirit and there diedmy Icarus my blossom in his prideO my dear lord lo where your son is bornethou antick death which laughest us here to scornanon from thy insulting tyrannycoupled in bonds of perpetuitytwo Talbots winged through the lither skyin thy despite shall scape mortalityO thou whose wounds become hard-favoured deathspeak to thy father ere thou yield thy breathbrave death by speaking wher he will or noimagine him a Frenchman and thy foepoor boy he smiles methinks as who should sayhad death been French then death had died to-daycome come and lay him in his fathers armsmy spirit can no longer bear these harmssoldiers adieu I have what I would havenow my old arms are young John Talbots gravehad York and Somerset brought rescue inwe should have found a bloody day of thishow the young whelp of Talbots raging-wooddid flesh his puny sword in Frenchmens bloodonce I encountered him and thus I saidthou maiden youth be vanquished by a maid but with a proud majestical high scornhe answered thus young Talbot was not bornto be the pillage of a giglot wench so rushing in the bowels of the Frenchhe left me proudly as unworthy fightdoubtless he would have made a noble knightsee where he lies inhearsed in the armsof the most bloody nurser of his harmshew them to pieces hack their bones asunderwhose life was Englands glory gallias wonderO no forbear for that which we have fledduring the life let us not wrong it deadherald conduct me to the Dauphins tentto know who hath obtained the glory of the dayon what submissive message art thou sentsubmission Dauphin itis a mere French wordwe English warriors wot not what it meansI come to know what prisoners thou hast taenand to survey the bodies of the

lordly monarch of the northappear and aid me in this enterprisethis speedy and quick appearance argues proofof your accustomed diligence to menow ye familiar spirits that are culledout of the powerful regions under earthhelp me this once that France may get the fieldO hold me not with silence over-longwhere I was wont to feed you with my bloodiull lop a member off and give it youin

to let her passmy hand would free her but my heart says noas plays the sun upon the glassy streamstwinkling another counterfeited beamso seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyesfain would I woo

princely majesty is suchconfounds the tongue and makes the senses roughsay earl of Suffolk if thy name be sowhat ransom must I pay before I passfor I perceive I am thy prisonerhow canst thou tell she will deny thy suitbefore thou make a trial of her lovewhy speakest thou not what ransom must I payshes beautiful and therefore to be wooedshe is a woman therefore to be wonwilt thou accept of ransom yea or nofond man remember that thou hast a wifethen how can Margaret be thy paramourI were best to leave him for he will not hearthere all is marred there lies a cooling cardhe talks at random sure the man is madand yet a dispensation may be hadand yet I would that you would answer meiull win this Lady Margaret for whomwhy for my king tush thats a wooden thinghe talks of wood it is some carpenteryet so my fancy may be satisfiedand peace established between these realmsbut there remains a scruple in that toofor though her father be the king of Naplesduke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poorand our nobility will scorn the matchhear ye captain are you not at leisureit shall be so disdain they neer so muchhenry is youthful and will quickly yieldmadam I have a secret to revealwhat though I be enthralled he seems a knightand will not any way dishonour melady vouchsafe to listen what I sayperhaps I shall be rescued by the Frenchand then I need not crave his courtesysweet madam give me hearing in a causetush women have been captivate ere nowlady wherefore talk you soI cry you mercy itis but quid for quosay gentle princess would you not supposeyour bondage happy to be made a queento be a queen in bondage is more vilethan is a slave in base servilityfor princes should be freeand so shall youif happy Englands royal king be freewhy what concerns his freedom unto meiull undertake to make thee Henrys queento put a golden sceptre in thy handand set a precious crown upon thy headif thou wilt condescend to be mywhathis loveI am unworthy to be Henrys wifeno gentle madam I unworthy amto woo so fair a dame to be his wifeand have no portion in the choice myselfhow say you madam are you so contentan if my father

were he herefarewell my lord Good wishes praise and prayersshall Suffolk ever have of Margaretfarewell sweet madam but hark you Margaretno princely commendations to my kingsuch commendations as become a maida virgin and his servant say to himwords sweetly placed and modestly directedbut madam I must trouble you againno loving token to his majestyyes my good lord a pure unspotted heartnever yet taint with love I send the kingand this withalthat for thyself I will not so presumeto send such peevish tokens to a kingO wert thou for myself but Suffolk staythou mayst not wander in that labyrinththere Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurksolit Henry with her wondrous praisebethink thee on her virtues that surmountand natural graces that extinguish artrepeat their semblance often on the seasthat when thou comest to kneel at Henrys feetthou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonderbring forth that sorceress condemned to burnah Joan this kills thy fathers heart outrighthave I sought every country far and nearand now it is my chance to find thee outmust I behold thy timeless cruel deathah Joan sweet daughter Joan iull die with theedecrepit miser base ignoble wretchI am descended of a gentler bloodthou art no father nor no friend of mineout out my lords an please you itis not soI did beget her all the parish knowsher mother liveth yet can testifyshe was the first fruit of my bachelorshipgraceless wilt thou deny thy parentagethis argues what her kind of life hath beenwicked and vile and so her death concludesfie Joan that thou wilt be so obstaclegod knows thou art a collop of my fleshand for thy sake have I shed many a teardeny me not I prithee gentle Joanpeasant avaunt you have suborned this manof purpose to obscure my noble birthitis true I gave a noble to the priestthe morn that I was wedded to her motherkneel down and take my blessing good my girlwilt thou not stoop now cursed be the timeof thy nativity I would the milkthy mother gave thee when thou suckedst her breasthad been a little ratsbane for thy sakeor else when thou didst keep my lambs a-fieldI wish some ravenous wolf had eaten theedost thou deny thy father cursed drabO burn her burn her hanging is too goodtake her away for she hath lived too longto fill the world with vious qualitiesfirst let me tell you whom you have condemnednot me begotten of a shepherd swainbut issued from the progeny of kingsvirtuous and holy chosen from aboveby inspiration of celestial graceto work exceeding miracles on earthI never had to do with wicked spiritsbut you that are polluted with your lustsstained with the guiltless blood of innocentscorrupt and tainted with a thousand vicesbecause you want the grace that others haveyou judge it straight a thing impossibleto compass wonders but by help of devilsno misconceived Joan of Arc hath beena virgin from her tender infancychaste and immaculate in very thoughtwhose maiden blood thus rigorously effusedwill cry for vengeance at the gates of heavenay ay away with her to executionand hark ye sirs because she is a maidspare for no fagots let there be enowplace barrels of pitch upon the fatal stakethat so her torture may be shortenedwill nothing turn your unrelenting heartsthen Joan discover thine infirmitythat warranteth by law to be thy privilegeI am with child ye bloody homidesmurder not then the fruit within my wombalthough ye hale me to a violent deathnow heaven forefend the holy maid with childthe greatest miracle that eer ye wroughtis all your strict preseness come to thisshe and the Dauphin have been jugglingI did imagine what would be her refugewell go to we will have no bastards liveespeally since Charles must father ityou are deceived my child is none of hisit was Alen on that enjoyed my lovealen on that notorious Machiavelit dies an if it had a thousand livesO give me leave I have deluded youitwas neither Charles nor yet the duke I namedbut Reignier king of Naples that prevaileda married man thats most intolerablewhy heres a girl I think she knows not wellthere were so many whom she may accuseits sign she hath been liberal and freeand yet forsooth she is a virgin purestrumpet thy words condemn thy brat and theeuse no entreaty for it is in vainthen lead me hence with whom I leave my cursemay never glorious sun reflex his beamsupon the country where you make abodebut darkness and the gloomy shade of deathenviron you till mischief and despairdrive you to break your necks or hang yourselvesbreak thou in pieces and consume to ashesthou foul accursed minister of helllord regent I do greet your excellencewith letters of commission from the kingfor know my lords the states of Christendommoved with remorse of these outrageous broilshave earnestly implored a general peacebetwixt our nation and the aspiring Frenchand here at hand the Dauphin and his trainapproacheth to confer about some matteris all our travail turned to this effectafter the slaughter of so many peersso many captains gentlemen and soldiersthat in this quarrel have been overthrownand sold their bodies for their countrys benefitshall we at last conclude effeminate peacehave we not lost most part of all the townsby treason falsehood and by treacheryour great progenitors had conqueredO Warwick Warwick I foresee with griefthe utter loss of all the realm of Francebe patient York if we conclude a peaceit shall be with such strict and severe covenantsas little shall the Frenchmen gain therebysince lords of England it is thus agreedthat peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in Francewe come to be informed by yourselveswhat the conditions of that league must bespeak winchester for boiling choler chokesthe hollow passage of my poisoned voiceby sight of these our baleful enemiescharles and the rest it is enacted thusthat in regard king Henry gives consentof mere compassion and of lenityto ease your country of distressful warand suffer you to breathe in fruitful peaceyou shall become true liegemen to his crownand Charles upon-condition thou wilt swearto pay him tribute and submit thyselfthou shalt be placed as viceroy under himand still enjoy thy regal dignitymust he be then as shadow of himselfadorn his temples with a coronetand yet in substance and authorityretain but privilege of a private manthis proffer is absurd and reasonlessitis known already that I am possessedwith more than half the gallian territoriesand therein reverenced for their lawful kingshall I for lucre of the rest unvanquisheddetract so much from that prerogativeas to be called but viceroy of the wholeno lord ambassador iull rather keepthat which I have than coveting for morebe cast from possibility of allinsulting Charles hast thou by secret meansused intercession to obtain a leagueand now the matter grows to compromisestandest thou aloof upon comparisoneither accept the title thou usurpestof benefit proceeding from our kingand not of any challenge of desertor we will plague thee with incessant warsmy lord you do not well in obstinacyto cavil in the course of this contractif once it be neglected ten to onewe shall not find like opportunityto say the truth it is your policyto save your subjects from such massacreand ruthless slaughters as are daily seenby our proceeding in hostilityand therefore take this compact of a trucealthough you break it when your pleasure serveshow sayst thou Charles shall our condition standit shallonly reserved you claim no interestin any of our towns of garrisonthen swear allegiance to his majestyas thou art knight never to disobeynor be rebellious to the crown of Englandthou nor thy nobles to the crown of Englandso now dismiss your army when ye pleasehang up your ensigns let your drums be stillfor here we entertain a solemn peaceyour wondrous rare description noble earlof beauteous Margaret hath astonished meher virtues graced with external giftsdo breed loves settled passions in my heartand like as rigour of tempestuous gustsprovokes the mightiest hulk against the tideso am I driven by breath of her renowneither to suffer shipwrack or arrivewhere I may have fruition of her lovetush my good lord this superfial taleis but a preface of her worthy praisethe chief perfections of that lovely damehad I suffient skill to utter themwould make a volume of enting linesable to ravish any dull conceitand which is more she is not so divineso full replete with choice of all delightsbut with as humble lowliness of mindshe is content to be at your commandcommand I mean of virtuous chaste intentsto love and honour Henry as her lordand otherwise will Henry neer presumetherefore my lord Protector give consentthat Margaret may be Englands royal queenso should I give consent to flatter sinyou know my lord your highness is betrothedunto another lady of esteemhow shall we then dispense with that contractand not deface your honour with reproachas doth a ruler with unlawful oathsor one that at a triumph having vowedto try his strength forsaketh yet the listsby reason of his adversarys oddsa poor earls daughter is unequal oddsand therefore may be broke without offencewhy what I pray is Margaret more than thather father is no better than an earlalthough in glorious titles he excelyes my good lord her father is a kingthe king of Naples and Jerusalemand of such great authority in Franceas his alliance will confirm our peaceand keep the Frenchmen in allegianceand so the earl of Armagnac may dobecause he is near kinsman unto Charlesbeside his wealth doth warrant liberal dowerwhere Reignier sooner will receive than givea dower my lords disgrace not so your kingthat he should be so abject base and poorto choose for wealth and not for perfect lovehenry is able to enrich his queenand not to seek a queen to make him richso worthless peasants bargain for their wivesas market-men for oxen sheep or horsemarriage is a matter of more worththan to be dealt in by attorneyshipnot whom we will but whom his grace affectsmust be companion of his nuptial bedand therefore lords since he affects her mostit most of all these reasons bindeth usin our opinions she should be preferredfor what is wedlock forced but a hellan age of discord and continual strifewhereas the contrary bringeth blissand is a pattern of celestial peacewhom should we match with Henry being a kingbut Margaret that is daughter to a kingher peerless feature joined with her birthapproves her fit for none but for a kingher valiant courage and undaunted spiritmore than in women commonly is seenwill answer our hope in issue of a kingfor Henry son unto a conqueroris likely to beget more conquerorsif with a lady of so high resolveas is fair Margaret he be linked in lovethen yield my lords and here conclude with methat Margaret shall be queen and none but shewhether it be through force of your reportmy noble lord of Suffolk or for thatmy tender youth was never yet attaintwith any passion of inflaming loveI cannot tell but this I am assuredI feel such sharp dissension in my breastsuch fierce alarums both of hope and fearas I am sick with working of my thoughtstake therefore shipping post my lord to Franceagree to any covenants and procurethat Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to cometo cross the seas to England and be crownedking Henrys faithful and anointed queenfor your expenses and suffient chargeamong the people gather up a tenthbe gone I say for till you do returnI rest perplexed with a thousand caresand you good uncle banish all offenceif you do censure me by what you werenot what you are I know it will excusethis sudden execution of my willand so conduct me where from companyI may revolve and ruminate my griefay grief I fear me both at first and lastthus Suffolk hath prevailed and thus he goesas did the youthful Paris once to Greecewith hope to find the like event in lovebut prosper better than the Trojan didmargaret shall now be queen and rule the kingbut I will rule both her the king and realmnow say Chatillon what would France with usthus after greeting speaks the king of Francein my behaviour to the majestythe borrowed majesty of England herea strange beginning borrowed majesty silence good mother hear the embassyphilip of France in right and true behalfof thy deceased brother geffreys sonarthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claimto this fair island and the territoriesto Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Mainedesiring thee to lay aside the swordwhich sways usurpingly these several titlesand put the same into young Arthurs handthy nephew and right royal sovereignwhat follows if we disallow of thisthe proud control of fierce and bloody warto enforce these rights so forbly withheldhere have we war for war and blood for bloodcontrolment for controlment so answer Francethen take my kings defiance from my mouththe furthest limit of my embassybear mine to him and so depart in peacebe thou as lightning in the eyes of Francefor ere thou canst report I will be therethe thunder of my cannon shall be heardso hence be thou the trumpet of our wrathand sullen presage of your own decayan honourable conduct let him havepembroke look toit farewell Chatillonwhat now my son have I not ever saidhow that ambitious Constance would not ceasetill she had kindled France and all the worldupon the right and party of her sonthis might have been prevented and made wholewith very easy arguments of lovewhich now the manage of two kingdoms mustwith fearful bloody issue arbitrateour strong possession and our right for usyour strong possession much more than your rightor else it must go wrong with you and meso much my consence whispers in your earwhich none but heaven and you and I shall hearmy liege here is the strangest controversycome from the country to be judged by youthat eer I heard shall I produce the menlet them approachour abbeys and our priories shall paythis expeditions chargewhat men are youyour faithful subject I a gentlemanborn in northamptonshire and eldest sonas I suppose to Robert faulconbridgea soldier by the honour-giving handof Cur-de-lion knighted in the fieldwhat art thouthe son and heir to that same faulconbridgeis that the elder and art thou the heiryou came not of one mother then it seemsmost certain of one mother mighty kingthat is well known and as I think one fatherbut for the certain knowledge of that truthI put you oer to heaven

wallsitis France for Englandengland for itselfyou men of Angiers and my loving subjectsyou loving men of Angiers Arthurs subjectsour trumpet called you to this gentle parlefor our advantage therefore hear us firstthese flags of France that are advanced herebefore the eye and prospect of your townhave hither marched to your endamagementthe cannons have their bowels full of wrathand

thisand till it be undoubted we do lockour former scruple in our strong-barred gateskings of ourselves until our fears resolvedbe by some certain king purged and deposedby heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kingsand stand securely on their battlementsas in a theatre whence they gape and pointat your industrious scenes and acts of deathyour royal presences be ruled by medo like the mutines of Jerusalembe friends awhile and both conjointly bendyour sharpest deeds of malice on this townby east and west let France and England mounttheir battering cannon charged to the mouthstill their soul-fearing clamours have brawled downthe flinty ribs of this contemptuous tyied play incessantly upon these jadeseven till unfenced desolationleave them as naked as the vulgar

minionto whom in favour she shall give the dayand kiss him with a glorious victoryhow like you this wild counsel mighty statessmacks it not something of the policynow by the sky that hangs above our headsI like it well France shall we knit our powersand lay this Angiers even with the groundthen after fight who shall be king of itan if thou hast the mettle of a kingbeing wronged as we are by this peevish townturn thou the mouth of thy artilleryas we will ours against these saucy wallsand when that we have dashed them to the groundwhy then defy each other and pell-mellmake work

a lout as hemy uncles will in this respect is mineif he see aught in you that makes him likethat anything he sees which moves his likingI can with ease translate it to my willor if you will to speak more properlyI will enforce it easily to my lovefurther I will not flatter you my lordthat all I see in you is worthy lovethan this that nothing do I see in youthough churlish thoughts themselves should be your judgethat I can find should merit any hatewhat say these young ones what say you my niecethat she is bound in honour still to dowhat you in wisdom still vouchsafe to sayspeak then prince Dauphin can you love this ladynay ask me if I can refrain from lovefor I do love her most unfeignedlythen do I give Volquessen Touraine Mainepoictiers and Anjou these five provinceswith her to thee and this addition morefull thirty thousand marks of English coinphilip of France if thou be pleased withalcommand thy son and daughter to join handsit likes us well

Marys chapel presentlythe rites of marriage shall be solemnizedis not the Lady Constance in this troopI know she is not for this match made upher presence would have interrupted muchwhere is she and her son tell me who knowsshe is sad and passionate at your highness tentand by my faith this league that we have madewill give her sadness very little curebrother of England how may we

ititis true fair daughter and this blessed dayever in France shall be kept festivalto solemnize this day the glorious sunstays in his course and plays the alchemistturning with splendour of his precious eyethe meagre cloddy earth to glittering goldthe yearly course that brings this day aboutshall never see it but a holidaya wicked day and not a holy daywhat hath this day deserved what hath it donethat it in golden letters should be setamong the high tides in the calendarnay rather turn this day out of the weekthis day of shame oppression perjuryor if it must stand still let wives with childpray that their burdens may not fall this daylest that their hopes prodigiously be crossedbut on this day let seamen fear no wrackno bargains break that are not this day madethis day all things begun come to ill endyea faith itself to hollow falsehood changeby heaven lady you shall have no causeto curse the fair proceedings of this dayhave I not pawned to you my majestyyou have beguiled me with a counterfeitresembling majesty which being touched and triedproves valueless you are forsworn forswornyou came in arms to spill mine enemies bloodbut now in arms you strengthen it with yoursthe grappling vigour and rough frown of waris cold in amity and painted peaceand our oppression hath made up this leaguearm arm you heavens against these perjured kingsa widow cries be husband to me heavenslet not the hours of this ungodly daywear out the day in peace but ere sunsetset armed discord btwixt these perjured kingshear me O hear melady Constance peacewar war no peace peace is to me a warO Lymoges O Austria thou dost shamethat bloody spoil thou slave thou wretch thou cowardthou little valiant great in villanythou ever strong upon the stronger sidethou fortunes champion that dost never fightbut when her humorous ladyship is byto teach thee safety thou art perjured tooand soothest up greatness what a fool art thoua ramping fool to brag and stamp and swearupon my party thou cold-blooded slavehast thou not spoke like thunder on my sidebeen sworn my soldier bidding me dependupon thy stars thy fortune and thy strengthand dost thou now fall over to my foesthou wear a hons hide doff it for shameand hang a calfs-skin on those recreant limbsO that a man should speak those words to meand hang a calfs-skin on those recreant limbsthou darest not say so villain for thy lifeand hang a calfs-skin on those recreant limbswe like not this thou dost forget thyselfhere comes the holy legate of the popehail you anointed deputies of heavento thee king John my holy errand isI Pandulph of fair Milan cardinaland from Pope Innocent the legate heredo in his name religiously demandwhy thou against the church our holy motherso wilfully dost spurn and force perforcekeep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishopof Canterbury from that holy seethis in our foresaid holy fathers namepope Innocent I do demand of theewhat earthly name to interrogatoriescan task the free breath of a sacred kingthou canst not cardinal devise a nameso slight unworthy and ridiculousto charge me to an answer as the popetell him this tale and from the mouth of Englandadd thus much more that no Italian priestshall tithe or toll in our dominionsbut as we under heaven are supreme headso under him that great supremacywhere we do reign we will alone upholdwithout the assistance of a mortal handso tell the pope all reverence set apartto him and his usurped authoritybrother of England you blaspheme in thisthough you and all the kings of Christendomare led so grossly by this meddling priestdreading the curse that money may buy outand by the merit of vile gold dross dustpurchase corrupted pardon of a manwho in that sale sells pardon from himselfthough you and all the rest so grossly ledthis juggling witchcraft with revenue cherishyet I alone alone do me opposeagainst the pope and count his friends my foesthen by the lawful power that I havethou shalt stand cursed and excommunicateand blessed shall he be that doth revoltfrom his allegiance to a hereticand meritorious shall that hand be calledcanonized and worshipped as a saintthat takes away by any secret coursethy hateful lifeO lawful let it bethat I have room with Rome to curse awhilegood father cardinal cry thou amento my keen curses for without my wrongthere is no tongue hath power to curse him righttheres law and warrant lady for my curseand for mine too when law can do no rightlet it be lawful that law bar no wronglaw cannot give my child his kingdom herefor he that holds his kingdom holds the lawtherefore since law itself is perfect wronghow can the law forbid my tongue to cursephilip of France on peril of a curselet go the hand of that arch-hereticand raise the power of France upon his headunless he do submit himself to Romelookest thou pale France do not let go thy handlook to that devil lest that France repentand by disjoining hands hell lose a soulking Philip listen to the cardinaland hang a calfs-skin on his recreant limbswell ruffian I must pocket up these wrongsbecauseyour breeches best may carry themphilip what sayst thou to the cardinalwhat should he say but as the cardinalbethink you father for the differenceis purchase of a heavy curse from Romeor the light loss of England for a friendforego the easierthats the curse of RomeO Lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee herein likeness of a new untrimmed bridethe Lady Constance speaks not from her faithbut from her needO if thou grant my needwhich only lives but by the death of faiththat need must needs infer this prinplethat faith would live again by death of needO then tread down my need and faith mounts upkeep my need up and faith is trodden downthe king is moved and answers not to thisO be removed from him and answer welldo so king Philip hang no more in doubthang nothing but a calfs-skin most sweet loutI am perplexed and know not what to saywhat canst thou say but will perplex thee moreif thou stand excommunicate and cursedgood reverend father make my person yoursand tell me how you would bestow yourselfthis royal hand and mine are newly knitand the conjunction of our inward soulsmarried in league coupled and linked togetherwith all religious strength of sacred vowsthe latest breath that gave the sound of wordswas deep-sworn faith peace amity true lovebetween our kingdoms and our royal selvesand even before this truce but new beforeno longer than we well could wash our handsto clap this royal bargain up of peaceheaven knows they were besmeared and overstainedwith slaughters penl where revenge did paintthe fearful difference of incensed kingsand shall these hands so lately purged of bloodso newly joined in love so strong in bothunyoke this seizure and this kind regreetplay fast and loose with faith so jest with heavenmake such unconstant children of ourselvesas now again to snatch our palm from palmunswear faith sworn and on the marriage-bedof smiling peace to march a bloody hostand make a riot on the gentle browof true sincerity O holy sirmy reverend father let it not be soout of your grace devise ordain imposesome gentle order and then we shall be blessedto do your pleasure and continue friendsall form is formless order orderlesssave what is opposite to Englands lovetherefore to arms be champion of our churchor let the church our mother breathe her cursea mothers curse on her revolting sonfrance thou mayst hold a serpent by the tonguea chafed lion by the mortal pawa fasting tiger safer by the tooththan keep in peace that hand which thou dost holdI may disjoin my hand but not my faithso makest thou faith an enemy to faithand like a civil war settest oath to oaththy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vowfirst made to heaven first be to heaven performedthat is to be the champion of our churchwhat since thou sworest is sworn against thyselfand may not be performed by thyselffor that which thou hast sworn to do amissis not amiss when it is truly doneand being not done where doing tends to illthe truth is then most done not doing itthe better act of purposes mistookis to mistake again though indirectyet indirection thereby grows directand falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools firewithin the scorched veins of one new-burnedit is religion that doth make vows keptbut thou hast sworn against religionby what thou swearest against the thing thou swearestand makest an oath the surety for thy truthagainst an oath the truth thou art unsureto swear swears only not to be forswornelse what a mockery should it be to swearbut thou dost swear only to be forswornand most forsworn to keep what thou dost sweartherefore thy later vows against thy firstis in thyself rebellion to thyselfand better conquest never canst thou makethan arm thy constant and thy nobler partsagainst these giddy loose suggestionsupon which better part our prayers come inif thou vouchsafe them but if not then knowthe peril of our curses light on theeso heavy as thou shalt not shake them offbut in despair die under their black weightrebellion flat rebellionwillit not bewill not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thinefather to armsupon thy wedding-dayagainst the blood that thou hast marriedwhat shall our feast be kept with slaughtered menshall braying trumpets and loud churlish drumsclamours of hell be measures to our pompO husband hear me ay alack how newis husband in my mouth even for that namewhich till this time my tongue did neer pronounceupon my knee I beg go not to armsagainst mine uncleO upon my kneemade hard with kneeling I do pray to theethou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doomforethought by heavennow shall I see thy love what motive maybe stronger with thee than the name of wifethat which upholdeth him that thee upholdshis honour O thine honour Lewis thine honourI muse your majesty doth seem so coldwhen such profound respects do pull you onI will denounce a curse upon his headthou shalt not need England iull fall from theeO fair return of banished majestyO foul revolt of French inconstancyfrance thou shalt rue this hour within this hourold Time the clock-setter that bald sexton Timeis it as he will well then France shall ruethe suns oercast with blood fair day adieuwhich is the side that I must go withalI am with both each army hath a handand in their rage I having hold of boththey whirl asunder and dismember mehusband I cannot pray that thou mayst winuncle I needs must pray that thou mayst losefather I may not wish the fortune thinegrandam I will not wish thy wishes thrivewhoever wins on that side shall I loseassured loss before the match be playedlady with me with me thy fortune liesthere where my fortune lives there my life diescousin go draw our puissance togetherfrance I am burned up with inflaming wratha rage whose heat hath this conditionthat nothing can allay nothing but bloodthe blood and dearest-valued blood of Francethy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turnto ashes ere our blood shall quench that firelook to thyself thou art in jeopardyno more than he that threats to arms lets hienow by my life this day grows wondrous hotsome airy devil hovers in the skyand pours down mischief Austrias head lie therewhile Philip breatheshubert keep this boy Philip make upmy mother is assailed in our tentand taen I fearmy lord I rescued herher highness is in safety fear you notbut on my liege for very little painswill bring this labour to a happy endso shall it be your grace shall stay behindso strongly guardedcousin look not sadthy grandam loves thee and thy uncle willas dear be to thee as thy father wasO this will make my mother die with griefcousin away for England haste beforeand ere our coming see thou shake the bagsof hoarding abbots set at libertyimprisoned angels the fat ribs of peacemust by the hungry now be fed uponuse our commission in his utmost forcebell book and candle shall not drive me backwhen gold and silver becks me to come onI leave your highness grandam I will prayif ever I remember to be holyfor your fair safety so I kiss your handfarewell gentle cousincoz farewellcome hither little kinsman hark a wordcome hither Hubert O my gentle Hubertwe owe thee much within this wall of fleshthere is a soul counts thee her creditorand with advantage means to pay thy loveand my good friend thy voluntary oathlives in this bosom dearly cherishedgive me thy hand I had a thing to saybut I will fit it with some better timeby heaven Hubert I am almost ashamedto say what good respect I have of theeI am much bounden to your majestygood friend thou hast no cause to say so yetbut thou shalt have and creep time neer so slowyet it shall come for me to do thee goodI had a thing to say but let it gothe sun is in the heaven and the proud dayattended with the pleasures of the worldis all too wanton and too full of gawdsto give me audience if the midnight belldid with his iron tongue and brazen mouthsound one into the drowsy race of nightif this same were a churchyard where we standand thou possessed with a thousand wrongsor if that surly spirit melancholyhad baked thy blood and made it heavy-thickwhich else runs tickling up and down the veinsmaking that idiot laughter keep mens eyesand strain their cheeks to idle merrimenta passion hateful to my purposesor if that thou couldst see me without eyeshear me without thine ears and make replywithout a tongue using conceit alonewithout eyes ears and harmful sound of wordsthen in despite of brooded watchful dayI would into thy bosom pour my thoughtsbut ah I will not yet I love thee welland by my troth I think thou lovest me wellso well that what you bid me undertakethough that my death were adjunct to my actby heaven I would do itdo not I know thou wouldstgood Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eyeon yon young boy iull tell thee what my friendhe is a very serpent in my wayand wheresoeer this foot of mine doth treadhe lies before me dost thou understand methou art his keeperand iull keep him sothat he shall not offend your majestydeathmy lorda gravehe shall not liveenoughI could be merry now Hubert I love theewell iull not say what I intend for theeremember madam fare you welliull send those powers oer to your majestymy blessing go with theefor England cousin gohubert shall be your man attend on youwith all true duty on toward Calais hoso by a roaring tempest on the flooda whole armado of convicted sailis scattered and disjoined from fellowshipcourage and comfort all shall yet go wellwhat can go well when we have run so illare we not beaten is not Angiers lostarthur taen prisoner divers dear friends slainand bloody England into England goneoerbearing interruption spite of Francewhat he hath won that hath he fortifiedso hot a speed with such advice disposedsuch temperate order in so fierce a causedoth want example who hath read or heardof any kindred action like to thiswell could I bear that England had this praiseso we could find some pattern of our shamelook who comes here a grave unto a soulholding the eternal spirit against her willin the vile prison of afflicted breathI prithee lady go away with melo now now see the issue of your peacepatience good lady comfort gentle Constanceno I defy all counsel all redressbut that which ends all counsel true redressdeath death O amiable lovely deaththou odoriferous stench sound rottennessarise forth from the couch of lasting nightthou hate and terror to prosperityand I will kiss thy detestable bonesand put my eyeballs in thy vaulty browsand ring these fingers with thy household wormsand stop this gap of breath with fulsome dustand be a carrion monster like thyselfcome grin on me and I will think thou smilestand buss thee as thy wife Miserys loveO come to meO fair affliction peaceno no I will not having breath to cryO that my tongue were in the thunders mouththen with a passion would I shake the worldand rouse from sleep that fell anatomywhich cannot hear a ladys feeble voicewhich scorns a modern invocationlady you utter madness and not sorrowthou art not holy to belie me soI am not mad this hair I tear is minemy name is Constance I was geffreys wifeyoung Arthur is my son and he is lostI am not mad I would to heaven I werefor then itis like I should forget myselfO if I could what grief should I forgetpreach some philosophy to make me madand thou shalt be canonized cardinalfor being not mad but sensible of griefmy reasonable part produces reasonhow I may be delivered of these woesand teaches me to kill or hang myselfif I were mad I should forget my sonor madly think a babe of clouts were heI am not mad too well too well I feelthe different plague of each calamitybind up those tresses O what love I notein the fair multitude of those her hairswhere but by chance a silver drop hath falleneven to that drop ten thousand wiry friendsdo glue themselves in soable grieflike true inseparable faithful lovessticking together in calamityto England if you willbind up your hairsyes that I will and wherefore will I do itI tore them from their bonds and cried aloudO that these hands could so redeem my sonas they have given these hairs their liberty but now I envy at their libertyand will again commit them to their bondsbecause my poor child is a prisonerand father cardinal I have heard you saythat we shall see and know our friends in heavenif that be true I shall see my boy againfor since the birth of Cain the first male childto him that did but yesterday suspirethere was not such a gracious creature bornbut now will canker-sorrow eat my budand chase the native beauty from his cheekand he will look as hollow as a ghostas dim and meagre as an agues fitand so hell die and rising so againwhen I shall meet him in the court of heavenI shall not know him therefore never nevermust I behold my pretty Arthur moreyou hold too heinous a respect of griefhe talks to me that never had a sonyou are as fond of grief as of your childgrief fills the room up of my absent childlies in his bed walks up and down with meputs on his pretty looks repeats his wordsremembers me of all his gracious partsstuffs out his vacant garments with his formthen have I reason to be fond of grieffare you well had you such a loss as II could give better comfort than you doI will not keep this form upon my headwhen there is such disorder in my witO lord my boy my Arthur my fair sonmy life my joy my food my all the worldmy widow-comfort and my sorrows cureI fear some outrage and iull follow hertheres nothing in this world can make me joylife is as tedious as a twice-told talevexing the dull ear of a drowsy manand bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet worlds tastethat it yields nought but shame and bitternessbefore the curing of a strong diseaseeven in the instant of repair and healththe fit is strongest evils that take leaveon their departure most of all show evilwhat have you lost by losing of this dayall days of glory joy and happinessif you had won it certainly you hadno no when fortune means to men most goodshe looks upon them with a threatening eyeitis strange to think how much king John hath lostin this which he accounts so clearly wonare not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoneras heartily as he is glad he hath himyour mind is all as youthful as your bloodnow hear me speak with a prophetic spiritfor even the breath of what I mean to speakshall blow each dust each straw each little rubout of the path which shall directly leadthy foot to Englands throne and therefore markjohn hath seized Arthur and it cannot bethat whiles warm life plays in that infants veinsthe misplaced John should entertain an hourone minute nay one quiet breath of resta sceptre snatched with an unruly handmust be as boisterously maintained as gainedand he that stands upon a slippery placemakes nice of no vile hold to stay him upthat John may stand then Arthur needs must fallso be it for it cannot be but sobut what shall I gain by young Arthurs fallyou in the right of Lady Blanch your wifemay then make all the claim that Arthur didand lose it life and all as Arthur didhow green you are and fresh in this old worldjohn lays you plots the times conspire with youfor he that steeps his safety in true bloodshall find but bloody safety and untruethis act so evilly borne shall cool the heartsof all his people and freeze up their zealthat none so small advantage shall step forthto check his reign but they will cherish itno natural exhalation in the skyno scope of nature no distempered dayno common wind no customed eventbut they will pluck away his natural causeand call them meteors prodigies and signsabortives presages and tongues of heavenplainly denounng vengeance upon Johnmay be he will not touch young Arthurs lifebut hold himself safe in his prisonmentO sir when he shall hear of your approachif that young Arthur be not gone alreadyeven at that news he dies and then the heartsof all his people shall revolt from himand kiss the lips of unacquainted changeand pick strong matter of revolt and wrathout of the bloody fingers ends of Johnmethinks I see this hurly all on footand O what better matter breeds for youthan I have named the bastard faulconbridgeis now in England ransacking the churchoffending charity if but a dozen Frenchwere there in arms they would be as a callto train ten thousand English to their sideor as a little snow tumbled aboutanon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphingo with me to the king itis wonderfulwhat may be wrought out of their discontentnow that their souls are topful of offencefor England go I will whet on the kingstrong reasons make strong actions let us goif you say ay the king will not say noheat me these irons hot and look thou standwithin the arras when I strike my footupon the bosom of the ground rush forthand bind the boy which you shall find with mefast to the chair be heedful hence and watchI hope your warrant will bear out the deeduncleanly scruples fear not you look toityoung lad come forth I have to say with yougood morrow Hubertgood morrow little princeas little prince having so great a titleto be more prince as may be you are sadindeed I have been merriermercy on memethinks nobody should be sad but Iyet I remember when I was in Franceyoung gentlemen would be as sad as nightonly for wantonness by my christendomso I were out of prison and kept sheepI should be as merry as the day is longand so I would be here but that I doubtmy uncle practises more harm to mehe is afraid of me and I of himis it my fault that I was geffreys sonno indeed isit not and I would to heavenI were your son so you would love me Hubertif I talk to him with his innocent pratehe will awake my mercy which lies deadtherefore I will be sudden and dispatchare you sick Hubert you look pale to-dayin sooth I would you were a little sickthat I might sit all night and watch with youI warrant I love you more than you do mehis words do take possession of my bosomread here young Arthurhow now foolish rheumturning dispiteous torture out of doorI must be brief lest resolution dropout at mine eyes in tender womanish tearscan you not read it is it not fair writtoo fairly Hubert for so foul effectmust you with hot irons burn out both mine eyesyoung boy I mustand will youand I willhave you the heart when your head did but acheI knit my handkercher about your browsthe best I had a princess wrought it meand I did never ask it you againand with my hand at midnight held your headand like the watchful minutes to the hourstill and anon cheered up the heavy timesaying what lack you and where lies your grief or what good love may I perform for you many a poor mans son would have lain stilland neer have spoke a loving word to youbut you at your sick-service had a princenay you may think my love was crafty loveand call it cunning do an if you willif heaven be pleased that you must use me illwhy then you must Will you put out mine eyesthese eyes that never did nor never shallso much as frown on youI have sworn to do itand with hot irons must I burn them outah none but in this iron age would do itthe iron of itself though heat red-hotapproaching near these eyes would drink my tearsand quench this fiery indignationeven in the matter of mine innocencenay after that consume away in rustbut for containing fire to harm mine eyeare you more stubborn-hard than hammered ironan if an angel should have come to meand told me Hubert should put out mine eyesI would not have believed him no tongue but Hubertscome forthdo as I bid you doO save me Hubert save me my eyes are outeven with the fierce looks of these bloody mengive me the iron I say and bind him herealas what need you be so boisterousroughI will not struggle I will stand stone-stillfor heavens sake Hubert let me not be boundnay hear me Hubert drive these men awayand I will sit as quiet as a lambI will not stir nor wince nor speak a wordnor look upon the iron angerlythrust but these men away and iull forgive youwhatever torment you do put me togo stand within let me alone with himI am best pleased to be from such a deedalas I then have chid away my friendhe hath a stern look but a gentle heartlet him come back that his compassion maygive life to yourscome boy prepare yourselfis there no remedynone but to lose your eyesO heaven that there were but a mote in yoursa grain a dust a gnat a wandering hairany annoyance in that precious sensethen feeling what small things are boisterous thereyour vile intent must needs seem horribleis this your promise go to hold your tonguehubert the utterance of a brace of tonguesmust needs want pleading for a pair of eyeslet me not hold my tongue let me not Hubertor Hubert if you will cut out my tongueso I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyesthough to no use but still to look on youlo by my troth the instrument is coldand would not harm meI can heat it boyno in good sooth the fire is dead with griefbeing create for comfort to be usedin undeserved extremes see else yourselfthere is no malice in this burning coalthe breath of heaven hath blown his spirit outand strewed repentant ashes on his headbut with my breath I can revive it boyan if you do you will but make it blushand glow with shame of your proceedings Hubertnay it perchance will sparkle in your eyesand like a dog that is compelled to fightsnatch at his master that doth tarre him onall things that you should use to do me wrongdeny their office only you do lackthat mercy which fierce fire and iron extendscreatures of note for mercy-lacking useswell see to live I will not touch thine eyesfor all the treasure that thine uncle owesyet am I sworn and I did purpose boywith this same very iron to burn them outO now you look like Hubert all this whileyou were disguisedpeace no more Adieuyour uncle must not know but you are deadiull fill these dogged spies with false reportsand pretty child sleep doubtless and securethat Hubert for the wealth of all the worldwill not offend theeO heaven I thank you Hubertsilence no more go closely in with memuch danger do I undergo for theehere once again we sit once again crownedand looked upon I hope with cheerful eyesthis once again but that your highness pleasedwas once superfluous you were crowned beforeand that high royalty was neer plucked offthe faiths of men neer stained with revoltfresh expectation troubled not the landwith any longed-for change or better statetherefore to be possessed with double pompto guard a title that was rich beforeto gild refined gold to paint the lilyto throw a perfume on the violetto smooth the ice or add another hueunto the rainbow or with taper-lightto seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnishis wasteful and ridiculous excessbut that your royal pleasure must be donethis act is as an anent tale new toldand in the last repeating troublesomebeing urged at a time unseasonablein this the antique and well-noted faceof plain old form is much disfiguredand like a shifted wind unto a sailit makes the course of thoughts to fetch aboutstartles and frights considerationmakes sound opinion sick and truth suspectedfor putting on so new a fashioned robewhen workmen strive to do better than wellthey do confound their skill in covetousnessand oftentimes excusing of a faultdoth make the fault the worse by the excuseas patches set upon a little breachdiscredit more in hiding of the faultthan did the fault before it was so patchedto this effect before you were newcrownedwe breathed our counsel but it pleased your highnessto overbear it and we are all well pleasedsince all and every part of what we woulddoth make a stand at what your highness willsome reasons of this double coronationI have possessed you with and think them strongand more more strong when lesser is my fearI shall indue you with meantime but askwhat you would have reformed that is not welland well shall you perceive how willinglyI will both hear and grant you your requeststhen I as one that am the tongue of theseto sound the purposes of all their heartsboth for myself and them but chief of allyour safety for the which myself and thembend their best studies heartily requestthe enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraintdoth move the murmuring lips of discontentto break into this dangerous argumentif what in rest you have in right you holdwhy then your fears which as they say attendthe steps of wrong should move you to mew upyour tender kinsman and to choke his dayswith barbarous ignorance and deny his youththe rich advantage of good exersethat the times enemies may not have thisto grace occasions let it be our suitthat you have bid us ask his libertywhich for our goods we do no further askthan whereupon our weal on you dependingcounts it your weal he have his libertylet it be so I do commit his youthto your direction Hubert what news with youthis is the man should do the bloody deedhe showed his warrant to a friend of minethe image of a wicked hemous faultlives in his eye that close aspect of hisdoes show the mood of a much troubled breastand I do fearfully believe itis donewhat we so feared he had a charge to dothe colour of the king doth come and gobetween his purpose and his consencelike heralds btwixt two dreadful battles sethis passion is so ripe it needs must breakand when it breaks I fear will issue thencethe foul corruption of a sweet childs deathwe cannot hold mortalitys strong handgood lords although my will to give is livingthe suit which you demand is gone and deadhe tells us Arthur is deceased to-nightindeed we feared his sickness was past cureindeed we heard how near his death he wasbefore the child himself felt he was sickthis must be answered either here or hencewhy do you bend such solemn brows on methink you I bear the shears of destinyhave I commandment on the pulse of lifeit is apparent foul play and itis shamethat greatness should so grossly offer itso thrive it in your game and so farewellstay yet lord Salisbury iull go with theeand find the inheritance of this poor childhis little kingdom of a forced gravethat blood which owed the breadth of all this islethree foot of it doth hold bad world the whilethis must not be thus borne this will break outto all our sorrows and ere long I doubtthey burn in indignation I repentthere is no sure foundation set on bloodno certain life achieved by others deatha fearful eye thou hast where is that bloodthat I have seen inhabit in those cheeksso foul a sky clears not without a stormpour down thy weather how goes all in Francefrom France to England never such a powerfor any foreign preparationwas levied in the body of a landthe copy of your speed is learned by themfor when you should be told they do preparethe tidings come that they are all arrivedO where hath our intelligence been drunkwhere hath it slept where is my mothers carethat such an army could be drawn in Franceand she not hear of itmy liege her earis stopped with dust the first of April diedyour noble mother and as I hear my lordthe Lady Constance in a frenzy diedthree days before but this from rumours tongueI idly heard if true or false I know notwithhold thy speed dreadful occasionO make a league with me till I have pleasedmy discontented peers what mother deadhow wildly then walks my estate in Franceunder whose conduct came those powers of Francethat thou for truth givest out are landed hereunder the Dauphinthou hast made me giddywith these ill tidingsnow what says the worldto your proceedings do not seek to stuffmy head with more ill news for it is fullbut if you be afeard to hear the worstthen let the worst unheard fall on your headbear with me cousin for I was amazedunder the tide but now I breathe againaloft the flood and can give audienceto any tongue speak it of what it willhow I have sped among the clergymenthe sums I have collected shall expressbut as I travelled hither through the landI find the people strangely fantasiedpossessed with rumours full of idle dreamsnot knowing what they fear but full of fearand heres a prophet that I brought with mefrom forth the streets of Pomfret whom I foundwith many hundreds treading on his heelsto whom he sung in rude harsh-sounding rimesthat ere the next Ascension-day at noonyour highness should deliver up your crownthou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou soforeknowing that the truth will fall out sohubert away with him imprison himand on that day at noon whereon he saysI shall yield up my crown let him be hangeddeliver him to safety and returnfor I must use theeO my gentle cousinhearest thou the news abroad who are arrivedthe French my lord mens mouths are full of itbesides I met lord Bigot and lord Salisburywith eyes as red as new-enkindled fireand others more going to seek the graveof Arthur whom they say is killed to-nighton your suggestiongentle kinsman goand thrust thyself into their companiesI have a way to win their loves againbring them before meI will seek them outnay but make haste the better foot beforeO let me have no subject enemieswhen adverse foreigners affright my townswith dreadful pomp of stout invasionbe Mercury set feathers to thy heelsand fly like thought from them to me againthe spirit of the time shall teach me speedspoke like a sprightful noble gentlemango after him for he perhaps shall needsome messenger betwixt me and the peersand be thou hewith all my heart my liegemy mother deadmy lord they say five moons were seen to-nightfour fixed and the fifth did whirl aboutthe other four in wondrous motionfive moonsold men and beldams in the streetsdo prophesy upon it dangerouslyyoung Arthurs death is common in their mouthsand when they talk of him they shake their headsand whisper one another in the earand he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wristwhilst he that hears makes fearful actionwith wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyesI saw a smith stand with his hammer thusthe whilst his iron did on the anvil coolwith open mouth swallowing a tailors newswho with his shears and measure in his handstanding on slippers which his nimble hastehad falsely thrust upon contrary feettold of a many thousand warlike Frenchthat were embattailed and ranked in Kentanother lean unwashed artificercuts off his tale and talks of Arthurs deathwhy seekest thou to possess me with these fearswhy urgest thou so oft young Arthurs deaththy hand hath murdered him I had a mighty causeto wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill himno had my lord why did you not provoke meit is the curse of kings to be attendedby slaves that take their humours for a warrantto break within the bloody house of lifeand on the winking of authorityto understand a law to know the meaningof dangerous majesty when perchance it frownsmore upon humour than advised respecthere is your hand and seal for what I didO when the last account btwixt heaven and earthis to be made then shall this hand and sealwitness against us to damnationhow oft the sight of means to do ill deedsmakes ill deeds done Hadst not thou been bya fellow by the hand of nature markedquoted and signed to do a deed of shamethis murder had not come into my mindbut taking note of thy abhorred aspectfinding thee fit for bloody villanyapt liable to be employed in dangerI faintly broke with thee of Arthurs deathand thou to be endeared to a kingmade it no consence to destroy a princemy lord hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pausewhen I spake darkly what I purposedor turned an eye of doubt upon my faceas bid me tell my tale in express wordsdeep shame had struck me dumb made me break offand those thy fears might have wrought fears in mebut thou didst understand me by my signsand didst in signs again parley with sinyea without stop didst let thy heart consentand consequently thy rude hand to actthe deed which both our tongues held vile to nameout of my sight and never see me moremy nobles leave me and my state is bravedeven at my gates with ranks of foreign powersnay in the body of this fleshly landthis kingdom this confine of blood and breathhostility and civil tumult reignsbetween my consence and my cousins deathqarm you against your other enemiesiull make a peace between your soul and youyoung Arthur is alive this hand of mineis yet a maiden and an innocent handnot painted with the crimson spots of bloodwithin this bosom never entered yetthe dreadful motion of a murderous thoughtand you have slandered nature in my formwhich howsoever rude exteriorlyis yet the cover of a fairer mindthan to be butcher of an innocent childdoth Arthur live O haste thee to the peersthrow this report on their incensed rageand make them tame to their obedienceforgive the comment that my passion madeupon thy feature for my rage was blindand foul imaginary eyes of bloodpresented thee more hideous than thou artO answer not but to my closet bringthe angry lords with all expedient hasteI conjure thee but slowly run more fastthe wall is high and yet will I leap downgood ground be pitiful and hurt me nottheres few or none do know me if they didthis ship-boys semblance hath disguised me quiteI am afraid and yet iull venture itif I get down and do not break my limbsiull find a thousand shifts to get awayas good to die and go as die and stayO me my uncles spirit is in these stonesheaven take my soul and England keep my boneslords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsburyit is our safety and we must embracethis gentle offer of the perilous timewho brought that letter from the cardinalthe Count Melun a noble lord of Francewhose private with me of the Dauphins loveis much more general than these lines importto-morrow morning let us meet him thenor rather then set forward for itwill betwo long days journey lords or eer we meetonce more to-day well met distempered lordsthe king by me requests your presence straightthe king hath dispossessed himself of uswe will not line his thin bestained cloakwith our pure honours nor attend the footthat leaves the print of blood whereer it walksreturn and tell him so we know the worstwhateer you think good words I think were bestour griefs and not our manners reason nowbut there is little reason in your grieftherefore itwere reason you had manners nowsir sir impatience hath his privilegeitis true to hurt his master no man elsethis is the prisonwhat is he lies hereO death made proud with pure and princely beautythe earth had not a hole to hide this deedmurder as hating what himself hath donedoth lay it open to urge on revengeor when he doomed this beauty to a gravefound it too precious-princely for a gravesir Richard what think you have you beheldor have you read or heard or could you thinkor do you almost think although you seethat you do see could thought without this objectform such another this is the very topthe height the crest or crest unto the crestof murders arms this is the bloodiest shamethe wildest savagery the vilest strokethat ever wall-eyed wrath or staring ragepresented to the tears of soft remorseall murders past do stand excused in thisand this so sole and so unmatchableshall give a holiness a purityto the yet unbegotten sin of timesand prove a deadly bloodshed but a jestexampled by this heinous spectacleit is a damned and a bloody workthe graceless action of a heavy handif that it be the work of any handif that it be the work of any handwe had a kind of light what would ensueit is the shameful work of Huberts handthe practice and the purpose of the kingfrom whose obedience I forbid my soulkneeling before this ruin of sweet lifeand breathing to his breathless excellencethe incense of a vow a holy vownever to taste the pleasures of the worldnever to be infected with delightnor conversant with ease and idlenesstill I have set a glory to this handby giving it the worship of revengeour souls religiously confirm thy wordsour souls religiously confirm thy wordslords I am hot with haste in seeking youarthur doth live the king hath sent for youO he is bold and blushes not at deathavaunt thou hateful villain get thee goneI am no villainmust I rob the lawyour sword is bright sir put it up againnot till I sheathe it in a murderers skinstand back lord Salisbury stand back I sayby heaven I think my swords as sharp as yoursI would not have you lord forget yourselfnor tempt the danger of my true defencelest I by marking of your rage forgetyour worth your greatness and nobilityout dunghill darest thou brave a noblemannot for my life but yet I dare defendmy innocent life against an emperorthou art a murdererdo not prove me soyet I am none whose tongue soeer speaks falsenot truly speaks who speaks not truly liescut him to pieceskeep the peace I saystand by or I shall gall you faulconbridgethou wert better gall the devil Salisburyif thou but frown on me or stir thy footor teach thy hasty spleen to do me shameiull strike thee dead Put up thy sword betimeor iull so maul you and your toasting-ironthat you shall think the devil is come from hellwhat wilt thou do renowned faulconbridgesecond a villain and a murdererlord Bigot I am nonewho killed this princeitis not an hour since I left him wellI honoured him I loved him and will weepmy date of life out for his sweet lifes losstrust not those cunning waters of his eyesfor villany is not without such rheumand he long traded in it makes it seemlike rivers of remorse and innocencyaway with me all you whose souls abhorthe uncleanly savours of a slaughter-housefor I am stifled with this smell of sinaway toward Bury to the Dauphin therethere tell the king he may inquire us outheres a good world knew you of this fair workbeyond the infinite and boundless reachof mercy if thou didst this deed of deathart thou damned Hubertdo but hear me sirha iull tell thee whatthou art damned as black nay nothing is so blackthou art more deep damned than prince Luferthere is not yet so ugly a fiend of hellas thou shalt be if thou didst kill this childupon my soulif thou didst but consentto this most cruel act do but despairand if thou wantest a cord the smallest threadthat ever spider twisted from her wombwill serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beamto hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyselfput but a little water in a spoonand it shall be as all the oceanenough to stifle such a villain upI do suspect thee very grievouslyif I in act consent or sin of thoughtbe guilty of the stealing that sweet breathwhich was embounded in this beauteous claylet hell want pains enough to torture meI left him wellgo bear him in thine armsI am amazed methinks and lose my wayamong the thorns and dangers of this worldhow easy dost thou take all England upfrom forth this morsel of dead royaltythe life the right and truth of all this realmis fled to heaven and England now is leftto tug and scamble and to part by the teeththe unowed interest of proud swelling statenow for the bare-picked bone of majestydoth dogged war bristle his angry crestand snarleth in the gentle eyes of peacenow powers from home and discontents at homemeet in one line and vast confusion waitsas doth a raven on a sick-fallen beastthe imminent decay of wrested pompnow happy he whose cloak and ceinture canhold out this tempest bear away that childand follow me with speed iull to the kinga thousand businesses are brief in handand heaven itself doth frown upon the landthus have I yielded up into your handthe rcle of my glorytake againfrom this my hand as holding of the popeyour sovereign greatness and authoritynow keep your holy word go meet the Frenchand from his holiness use all your powerto stop their marches fore we are inflamedour discontented counties do revoltour people quarrel with obedienceswearing allegiance and the love of soulto stranger blood to foreign royaltythis inundation of mistempered humourrests by you only to be qualifiedthen pause not for the present times so sickthat present medine must be ministeredor overthrow incurable ensuesit was my breath that blew this tempest upupon your stubborn usage of the popebut since you are a gentle convertitemy tongue shall hush again this storm of warand make fair weather in your blustering landon this Ascension-day remember wellupon your oath of service to the popego I to make the French lay down their armsis this Ascension-day did not the prophetsay that before Ascension-day at noonmy crown I should give off even so I haveI did suppose it should be on constraintbut heaven be thanked it is but voluntaryall Kent hath yielded nothing there holds outbut Dover Castle London hath receivedlike a kind host the Dauphin and his powersyour nobles will not hear you but are goneto offer service to your enemyand wild amazement hurries up and downthe little number of your doubtful friendswould not my lords return to me againafter they heard young Arthur was alivethey found him dead and cast into the streetsan empty casket where the jewel of lifeby some damned hand was robbed and taen awaythat villain Hubert told me he did liveso on my soul he did for aught he knewbut wherefore do you droop why look you sadbe great in act as you have been in thoughtlet not the world see fear and sad distrustgovern the motion of a kingly eyebe stirring as the time be fire with firethreaten the threatener and outface the browof bragging horror so shall inferior eyesthat borrow their behaviours from the greatgrow great by your example and put onthe dauntless spirit of resolutionaway and glister like the god of warwhen he intendeth to become the fieldshow boldness and aspiring confidencewhat shall they seek the lion in his denand fright him there and make him tremble thereO let it not be said forage and runto meet displeasure further from the doorsand grapple with him ere he comes so nighthe legate of the pope hath been with meand I have made a happy peace with himand he hath promised to dismiss the powersled by the DauphinO inglorious leagueshall we upon the footing of our landsend fair-play orders and make compromiseinsinuation parley and base truceto arms invasive shall a beardless boya cockered silken wanton brave our fieldsand flesh his spirit in a war-like soulmocking the air with colours idly spreadand find no check let us my liege to armsperchance the cardinal cannot make your peaceor if he do let it at least be saidthey saw we had a purpose of defencehave thou the ordering of this present timeaway then with good courage yet I knowour party may well meet a prouder foemy lord Melun let this be copied outand keep it safe for our remembrancereturn the precedent to these lords againthat having our fair order written downboth they and we perusing oer these notesmay know wherefore we took the sacramentand keep our faiths firm and inviolableupon our sides it never shall be brokenand noble Dauphin albeit we sweara voluntary zeal an unurged faithto your proceedings yet believe me princeI am not glad that such a sore of timeshould seek a plaster by contemned revoltand heal the inveterate canker of one woundby making many O it grieves my soulthat I must draw this metal from my sideto be a widow-maker O and therewhere honourable rescue and defencecries out upon the name of Salisburybut such is the infection of the timethat for the health and physic of our rightwe cannot deal but with the very handof stern injustice and confused wrongand isit not pity O my grieved friendsthat we the sons and children of this islewere born to see so sad an hour as thiswherein we step after a stranger marchupon her gentle bosom and fill upher enemies ranks I must withdraw and weepupon the spot of this enforced causeto grace the gentry of a land remoteand follow unacquainted colours herewhat here O nation that thou couldst removethat Neptunes arms who clippeth thee aboutwould bear thee from the knowledge of thyselfand gripple thee unto a pagan shorewhere these two christian armies might combinethe blood of malice in a vein of leagueand not to spend it so unneighbourlya noble temper dost thou show in thisand great affections wrestling in thy bosomdo make an earthquake of nobilityO what a noble combat hast thou foughtbetween compulsion and a brave respectlet me wipe off this honourable dewthat silverly doth progress on thy cheeksmy heart hath melted at a ladys tearsbeing an ordinary inundationbut this effusion of such manly dropsthis shower blown up by tempest of the soulstartles mine eyes and makes me more amazedthan had I seen the vaulty top of heavenfigured quite oer with burning meteorslift up thy brow renowned Salisburyand with a great heart heave away this stormcommend these waters to those baby eyesthat never saw the giant world enragednor met with fortune other than at feastsfull warm of blood of mirth of gossipingcome come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deepinto the purse of rich prosperityas Lewis himself so nobles shall you allthat knit your sinews to the strength of mineand even there methinks an angel spakelook where the holy legate comes apaceto give us warrant from the hand of heavenand on our actions set the name of rightwith holy breathhail noble prince of Francethe next is this king John hath reconledhimself to Rome his spirit is come inthat so stood out against the holy churchthe great metropolis and see of Rometherefore thy threatning colours now wind upand tame the savage spirit of wild warthat like a lion fostered up at handit may lie gently at the foot of peaceand be no further harmful than in showyour grace shall pardon me I will not backI am too high-born to be propertiedto be a secondary at controlor useful serving-man and instrumentto any sovereign state throughout the worldyour breath first kindled the dead coal of warsbetween this chastised kingdom and myselfand brought in matter that should feed this fireand now itis far too huge to be blown outwith that same weak wind which enkindled ityou taught me how to know the face of rightacquainted me with interest to this landyea thrust this enterprise into my heartand come you now to tell me John hath madehis peace with Rome what is that peace to meI by the honour of my marriage-bedafter young Arthur claim this land for mineand now it is half-conquered must I backbecause that John hath made his peace with Romeam I Romes slave what penny hath Rome bornewhat men provided what munition sentto underprop this action isit not Ithat undergo this charge who else but Iand such as to my claim are liablesweat in this business and maintain this warhave I not heard these islanders shout outvive le roy as I have banked their townshave I not here the best cards for the gameto win this easy match played for a crownand shall I now give oer the yielded setno no on my soul it never shall be saidyou look but on the outside of this workoutside or inside I will not returntill my attempt so much be glorifiedas to my ample hope was promisedbefore I drew this gallant head of warand culled these fiery spirits from the worldto outlook conquest and to win renowneven in the jaws of danger and of deathwhat lusty trumpet thus doth summon usaccording to the fair play of the worldlet me have audience I am sent to speakmy holy lord of Milan from the kingI come to learn how you have dealt for himand as you answer I do know the scopeand warrant limited unto my tonguethe Dauphin is too wilful-oppositeand will not temporize with my entreatieshe flatly says hell not lay down his armsby all the blood that ever fury breathedthe youth says well now hear our English kingfor thus his royalty doth speak in mehe is prepared and reason too he shouldthis apish and unmannerly approachthis harnessed masque and unadvised revelthis unhaired sauness and boyish troopsthe king doth smile at and is well preparedto whip this dwarfish war these pigmy armsfrom out the rcle of his territoriesthat hand which had the strength even at your doorto cudgel you and make you take the hatchto dive like buckets in concealed wellsto crouch in litter of your stable planksto lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunksto hug with swine to seek sweet safety outin vaults and prisons and to thrill and shakeeven at the crying of your nations crowthinking this voice an armed Englishmanshall that victorious hand be feebled herethat in your chambers gave you chastisementno know the gallant monarch is in armsand like an eagle oer his aiery towersto souse annoyance that comes near his nestand you degenerate you ingrate revoltsyou bloody Neroes ripping up the wombof your dear mother England blush for shamefor your own ladies and pale-visaged maidslike Amazons come tripping after drumstheir thimbles into armed gauntlets changetheir neelds to lances and their gentle heartsto fierce and bloody inclinationthere end thy brave and turn thy face in peacewe grant thou canst outscold us fare thee wellwe hold our time too precious to be spentwith such a brabblergive me leave to speakno I will speakwe will attend to neitherstrike up the drums and let the tongue of warplead for our interest and our being hereindeed your drums being beaten will cry outand so shall you being beaten do but startan echo with the clamour of thy drumand even at hand a drum is ready bracedthat shall reverberate all as loud as thinesound but another and another shallas loud as thine rattle the welkins earand mock the deep-mouthed thunder for at handnot trusting to this halting legate herewhom he hath used rather for sport than needis warlike John and in his forehead sitsa bare-ribbed death whose office is this dayto feast upon whole thousands of the Frenchstrike up our drums to find this danger outand thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubthow goes the day with us O tell me Hubertbadly I fear how fares your majestythis fever that hath troubled me so longlies heavy on me O my heart is sickmy lord your valiant kinsman faulconbridgedesires your majesty to leave the fieldand send him word by me which way you gotell him toward Swinstead to the abbey therebe of good comfort for the great supplythat was expected by the Dauphin hereare wracked three nights ago on Goodwin sandsthis news was brought to Richard but even nowthe French fight coldly and retire themselvesay me this tyrant fever burns me upand will not let me welcome this good newsset on toward Swinstead to my litter straightweakness possesseth me and I am faintI did not think the king so stored with friendsup once again put spirit in the Frenchif they miscarry we miscarry toothat misbegotten devil faulconbridgein spite of spite alone upholds the daythey say king John sore sick hath left the fieldlead me to the revolts of England herewhen we were happy we had other namesit is the Count Melunwounded to deathfly noble English you are bought and soldunthread the rude eye of rebellionand welcome home again discarded faithseek out king John and fall before his feetfor if the French be lords of this loud dayhe means to recompense the pains you takeby cutting off your heads thus hath he swornand I with him and many moe with meupon the altar at Saint Edmundsburyeven on that altar where we swore to youdear amity and everlasting lovemay this be possible may this be truehave I not hideous death within my viewretaining but a quantity of lifewhich bleeds away even as a form of waxresolveth from his figure gainst the firewhat in the world should make me now deceivesince I must lose the use of all deceitwhy should I then be false since it is truethat I must die here and live hence by truthI say again if Lewis do win the dayhe is forsworn if eer those eyes of yoursbehold another day break in the eastbut even this night whose black contagious breathalready smokes about the burning crestof the old feeble and day-wearied suneven this ill night your breathing shall expirepaying the fine of rated treacheryeven with a treacherous fine of all your livesif Lewis by your assistance win the daycommend me to one Hubert with your kingthe love of him and this respect besidesfor that my grandsire was an Englishmanawakes my consence to confess all thisin lieu whereof I pray you bear me hencefrom forth the noise and rumour of the fieldwhere I may think the remnant of my thoughtsin peace and part this body and my soulwith contemplation and devout desireswe do believe thee and beshrew my soulbut I do love the favour and the formof this most fair occasion by the whichwe will untread the steps of damned flightand like a bated and retired floodleaving our rankness and irregular coursestoop low within those bounds we have oerlookedand calmly run on in obedienceeven to our ocean to our great king Johnmy arm shall give thee help to bear thee hencefor I do see the cruel pangs of deathright in thine eye away my friends New flightand happy newness that intends old rightthe sun of heaven methought was loath to setbut stayed and made the western welkin blushwhen the English measured backward their own groundin faint retire O bravely came we offwhen with a volley of our needless shotafter such bloody toil we bid good nightand wound our tottering colours clearly uplast in the field and almost lords of itwhere is my prince the Dauphinhere what newsthe Count Melun is slain the English lordsby his persuasion are again falln offand your supply which you have wished so longare cast away and sunk on Goodwin sandsah foul shrewd news beshrew thy very heartI did not think to be so sad to-nightas this hath made me who was he that saidking John did fly an hour or two beforethe stumbling night did part our weary powerswhoever spoke it it is true my lordwell keep good quarter and good care to-nightthe day shall not be up so soon as Ito try the fair adventure of to-morrowwhos there speak ho speak quickly or I shoota friend what art thouof the part of Englandwhither dost thou gowhats that to thee why may not I demandof thine affairs as well as thou of minehubert I thinkthou hast a perfect thoughtI will upon all hazards well believethou art my friend that knowest my tongue so wellwho art thouwho thou wilt and if thou pleasethou mayst befriend me so much as to thinkI come one way of the Plantagenetsunkind remembrance thou and eyeless nighthave done me shame brave soldier pardon methat any accent breaking from thy tongueshould scape the true acquaintance of mine earcome come sans compliment what news abroadwhy here walk I in the black brow of nightto find you outbrief then and whats the newsO my sweet sir news fitting to the nightblack fearful comfortless and horribleshow me the very wound of this ill newsI am no woman iull not swound at itthe king I fear is poisoned by a monkI left him almost speechless and broke outto acquaint you with this evil that you mightthe better arm you to the sudden timethan if you had at leisure known of thishow did he take it who did taste to hima monk I tell you a resolved villainwhose bowels suddenly burst out the kingyet speaks and peradventure may recoverwhom didst thou leave to tend his majestywhy know you not the lords are all come backand brought prince Henry in their companyat whose request the king hath pardoned themand they are all about his majestywithhold thine indignation mighty heavenand tempt us not to bear above our poweriull tell thee Hubert half my power this nightpassing these flats are taken by the tidethese Lincoln washes have devoured themmyself well-mounted hardly have escapedaway before conduct me to the kingI doubt he will be dead or ere I comeit is too late the life of all his bloodis touched corruptibly and his pure brainwhich some suppose the souls frail dwelling-housedoth by the idle comments that it makesforetell the ending of mortalityhis highness yet doth speak and holds beliefthat being brought into the open airit would allay the burning qualityof that fell poison which assaileth himlet him be brought into the orchard heredoth he still ragehe is more patientthan when you left him even now he sungO vanity of sickness fierce extremesin their continuance will not feel themselvesdeath having preyed upon the outward partsleaves them invisible and his siege is nowagainst the mind the which he pricks and woundswith many legions of strange fantasieswhich in their throng and press to that last holdconfound themselves itis strange that death should singI am the cygnet to this pale faint swanwho chants a doleful hymn to his own deathand from the organ-pipe of frailty singshis soul and body to their lasting restbe of good comfort prince for you are bornto set a form upon that indigestwhich he hath left so shapeless and so rudeay marry now my soul hath elbow-roomit would not out at windows nor at doorsthere is so hot a summer in my bosomthat all my bowels crumble up to dustI am a scribbled form drawn with a penupon a parchment and against this firedo I shrink uphow fares your majestypoisoned ill-fare dead forsook cast offand none of you will bid the winter cometo thrust his icy fingers in my mawnor let my kingdoms rivers take their coursethrough my burned bosom nor entreat the northto make his bleak winds kiss my parched lipsand comfort me with cold I do not ask you muchI beg cold comfort and you are so straitand so ingrateful you deny me thatO that there were some virtue in my tearsthat might relieve youthe salt in them is hotwithin me is a hell and there the poisonis as a fiend confined to tyrannizeon unreprievable condemned bloodO I am scalded with my violent motionand spleen of speed to see your majestyO cousin thou art come to set mine eyethe tackle of my heart is cracked and burnedand all the shrouds wherewith my life should sailare turned to one thread one little hairmy heart hath one poor string to stay it bywhich holds but till thy news be utteredand then all this thou seest is but a clodand module of confounded royaltythe Dauphin is preparing hitherwardwhere heaven he knows how we shall answer himfor in a night the best part of my poweras I upon advantage did removewere in the washes all unwarilydevoured by the unexpected floodyou breathe these dead news in as dead an earmy liege my lord but now a king now thuseven so must I run on and even so stopwhat surety of the world what hope what staywhen this was now a king and now is clayart thou gone so I do but stay behindto do the office for thee of revengeand then my soul shall wait on thee to heavenas it on earth hath been thy servant stillnow now you stars that move in your right sphereswhere be your powers Show now your mended faithsand instantly return with me againto push destruction and perpetual shameout of the weak door of our fainting landstraight let us seek or straight we shall be soughtthe Dauphin rages at our very heelsit seems you know not then so much as wethe Cardinal Pandulph is within at restwho half an hour since came from the Dauphinand brings from him such offers of our peaceas we with honour and respect may takewith purpose presently to leave this warhe will the rather do it when he seesourselves well sinewed to our defencenay it is in a manner done alreadyfor many carriages he hath dispatchedto the sea-side and put his cause and quarrelto the disposing of the cardinalwith whom yourself myself and other lordsif you think meet this afternoon will postto consummate this business happilylet it be so and you my noble princewith other princes that may best be sparedshall wait upon your fathers funeralat Worcester must his body be interredfor so he willed itthither shall it thenand happily may your sweet self put onthe lineal state and glory of the landto whom with all submission on my kneeI do bequeath my faithful servicesand true subjection everlastinglyand the like tender of our love we maketo rest without a spot for evermoreI have a kind soul that would give you thanksand knows not how to do it but with tearsO let us pay the time but needful woesince it hath been beforehand with our griefsthis England never did nor never shalllie at the proud foot of a conquerorbut when it first did help to wound itselfnow these her princes are come home againcome the three corners of the world in armsand we shall shock them nought shall make us rueif England to itself do rest but truechorusO for a muse of fire that would ascendthe brightest heaven of inventiona kingdom for a stage princes to actand monarchs to behold the swelling scenethen should the war-like Harry like himselfassume the port of Mars and at his heelsleashed in like hounds should famine sword and firecrouch for employment but pardon gentles allthe flat unraised spirits that hath daredon this unworthy scaffold to bring forthso great an object can this cockpit holdthe vasty fields of France or may we cramwithin this wooden O the very casquesthat did affright the air at AgincourtO pardon since a crooked figure mayattest in little place a millionand let us phers to this great accompton your imaginary forces worksuppose within the girdle of these wallsare now confined two mighty monarchieswhose high upreared and abutting frontsthe perilous narrow ocean parts asunderpiece out our imperfections with your thoughtsinto a thousand parts divide one manand make imaginary puissancethink when we talk of horses that you see themprinting their proud hoofs inthe receiving earthfor itis your thoughts that now must deck our kingscarry them here and there jumping oer timesturning the accomplishment of many yearsinto an hour-glass for the which supplyadmit me Chorus to this historywho prologue-like your humble patience praygently to hear kindly to judge our playmy lord iull tell you that self bill is urgedwhich in th eleventh year of the last kings reignwas like and had indeed against us passedbut that the scambling and unquiet timedid push it out of further questionbut how my lord shall we resist it nowit must be thought on if it pass against uswe lose the better half of our possessionfor all the temporal lands which men devoutby testament have given to the churchwould they strip from us being valued thusas much as would maintain to the kings honourfull fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knightssix thousand and two hundred good esquiresand to relief of lazars and weak ageof indigent faint souls past corporal toila hundred almshouses right well suppliedand to the coffers of the king besidea thousand pounds by the year thus runs the billthis would drink deeptwould drink the cup and allbut what preventionthe king is full of grace and fair regardand a true lover of the holy churchthe courses of his youth promised it notthe breath no sooner left his fathers bodybut that his wildness mortified in himseemed to die too yea at that very momentconsideration like an angel cameand whipped the offending Adam out of himleaving his body as a paradiseto envelop and contain celestial spiritsnever was such a sudden scholar madenever came reformation in a floodwith such a heady currance scouring faultsnor never Hydra-headed wilfulnessso soon did lose his seat and all at onceas in this kingwe are blessed in the changehear him but reason in divinityand all-admiring with an inward wishyou would desire the king were made a prelatehear him debate of commonwealth affairsyou would say it hath been all in all his studylist his discourse of war and you shall heara fearful battle rendered you in musicturn him to any cause of policythe Gordian knot of it he will unloosefamiliar as his garter that when he speaksthe air a chartered libertine is stilland the mute wonder lurketh in mens earsto steal his sweet and honeyed sentencesso that the art and practic part of lifemust be the mistress to this theoricwhich is a wonder how his grace should glean itsince his addiction was to courses vainhis companies unlettered rude and shallowhis hours filled up with riots banquets sportsand never noted in him any studyany retirement any sequestrationfrom open haunts and popularitythe strawberry grows underneath the nettleand wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestneighboured by fruit of baser qualityand so the prince obscured his contemplationunder the veil of wildness which no doubtgrew like the summer grass fastest by nightunseen yet cresve in his facultyit must be so for miracles are ceasedand therefore we must needs admit the meanshow things are perfectedbut my good lordhow now for mitigation of this billurged by the commons doth his majestyincline to it or nohe seems indifferentor rather swaying more upon our partthan cherishing the exhibiters against usfor I have made an offer to his majestyupon our spiritual convocationand in regard of causes now in handwhich I have opened to his grace at largeas touching France to give a greater sumthan ever at one time the clergy yetdid to his predecessors part withalhow did this offer seem received my lordwith good acceptance of his majestysave that there was not time enough to hearas I perceived his grace would fain have donethe severals and unhidden passagesof his true titles to some certain dukedomsand generally to the crown and seat of Francederived from Edward his great-grandfatherwhat was the impediment that broke this offthe French ambassador upon that instantcraved audience and the hour I think is cometo give him hearing is it four oclockit isthen go we in to know his embassywhich I could with a ready guess declarebefore the Frenchman speak a word of itiull wait upon you and I long to hear itwhere is my gracious lord of Canterburynot here in presencesend for him good uncleshall we call in the ambassador my liegenot yet my cousin we would be resolvedbefore we hear him of some things of weightthat task our thoughts concerning us and Francegod and his angels guard your sacred throneand make you long become itsure we thank youmy learned lord we pray you to proceedand justly and religiously unfoldwhy the law Salique that they have in Franceor should or should not bar us in our claimand God forbid my dear and faithful lordthat you should fashion wrest or bow your readingor nicely charge your understanding soulwith opening titles miscreate whose rightsuits not in native colours with the truthfor God doth know how many now in healthshall drop their blood in approbationof what your reverence shall inte us totherefore take heed how you impawn our personhow you awake the sleeping sword of warwe charge you in the name of God take heedfor never two such kingdoms did contendwithout much fall of blood whose guiltless dropsare every one a woe a sore complaintgainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the swordsthat make such waste in brief mortalityunder this conjuration speak my lordand we will hear note and believe in heartthat what you speak is in your consence washedas pure as sin with baptismthen hear me gracious sovereign and you peersthat owe yourselves your lives and servicesto this imperial throne there is no barto make against your highness claim to Francebut this which they produce from Pharamondin terram Salicam mulieres ne succedantno woman shall succeed in Salique land which Salique land the French unjustly glozeto be the realm of France and Pharamondthe founder of this law and female baryet their own authors faithfully affirmthat the land Salique is in Germanybetween the floods of Sala and of Elbewhere Charles the great having subdued the Saxonsthere left behind and settled certain Frenchwho holding in disdain the German womenfor some dishonest manners of their lifeestablished then this law to wit no femaleshould be inheritrix in Salique landwhich Salique as I said btwixt Elbe and Salais at this day in Germany called Meisenthen doth it well appear the Salique lawwas not devised for the realm of Francenor did the French possess the Salique landuntil four hundred one-and-twenty yearsafter defunction of king Pharamondidly supposed the founder of this lawwho died within the year of our redemptionfour hundred twenty-six and Charles the greatsubdued the Saxons and did seat the Frenchbeyond the river Sala in the yeareight hundred five besides their writers sayking Pepin which deposed Childericdid as heir general being descendedof Blithild which was daughter to king Clothairmake claim and title to the crown of Francehugh Capet also who usurped the crownof Charles the duke of Loraine sole heir maleof the true line and stock of Charles the greatto find his title with some shows of truththough in pure truth it was corrupt and naughtconveyed himself as heir to the Lady Lingaredaughter to Charlemain who was the sonto Lewis the emperor and Lewis the sonof Charles the great Also king Lewis the Tenthwho was sole heir to the usurper Capetcould not keep quiet in his consencewearing the crown of France till satisfiedthat fair queen Isabel his grandmotherwas lineal of the Lady Ermengaredaughter to Charles the aforesaid duke of Loraineby the which marriage the line of Charles the greatwas re-united to the crown of Franceso that as clear as is the summers sunking Pepins title and Hugh Capets claimking Lewis his satisfaction all appearto hold in right and title of the femaleso do the kings of France unto this dayhowbeit they would hold up this Salique lawto bar your highness claiming from the femaleand rather choose to hide them in a netthan amply to imbar their crooked titlesusurped from you and your progenitorsmay I with right and consence make this claimthe sin upon my head dread sovereignfor in the book of Numbers is it writwhen the son dies let the inheritancedescend unto the daughter gracious lordstand for your own unwind your bloody flaglook back into your mighty ancestorsgo my dread lord to your great-grandsires tombfrom whom you claim invoke his war-like spiritand your great-uncles Edward the Black princewho on the French ground played a tragedymaking defeat on the full power of Francewhiles his most mighty father on a hillstood smiling to behold his lions whelpforage in blood of French nobilityO noble English that could entertainwith half their forces the full pride of Franceand let another half stand laughing byall out of work and cold for actionawake remembrance of these valiant deadand with your puissant arm renew their featsyou are their heir you sit upon their thronethe blood and courage that renowned themruns in your veins and my thrice-puissantliegeis in the very May-morn of his youthripe for exploits and mighty enterprisesyour brother kings and monarchs of the earthdo all expect that you should rouse yourselfas did the former lions of your bloodthey know your grace hath cause and means and mightso hath your highness never king of Englandhad nobles richer and more loyal subjectswhose hearts have left their bodies here in Englandand lie pavilioned in the fields of FranceO let their bodies follow my dear liegewith blood and sword and fire to win your rightin aid whereof we of the spiritualtywill raise your highness such a mighty sumas never did the clergy at one timebring in to any of your ancestorswe must not only arm to invade the Frenchbut lay down our proportions to defendagainst the Scot who will make road upon uswith all advantagesthey of those marches gracious sovereignshall be a wall suffient to defendour inland from the pilfering bordererswe do not mean the coursing snatchers onlybut fear the main intendment of the Scotwho hath been still a giddy neighbour to usfor you shall read that my great-grandfathernever went with his forces into Francebut that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdomcame pouring like the tide into a breachwith ample and brim fulness of his forcegalling the gleaned land with hot essaysgirding with grievous siege castles and townsthat England being empty of defencehath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhoodshe hath been then more feared than harmed my liegefor hear her but exampled by herselfwhen all her chivalry hath been in Franceand she a mourning widow of her noblesshe hath herself not only well defendedbut taken and impounded as a straythe king of Scots whom she did send to Franceto fill king Edwards fame with prisoner kingsand make your chronicle as rich with praiseas is the owse and bottom of the seawith sunken wrack and sumless treasuriesbut theres a saying very old and trueif that you will France winthen with Scotland first beginfor once the eagle England being in preyto her unguarded nest the weasel Scotcomes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggsplaying the mouse in absence of the catto tear and havoc more than she can eatit follows then the cat must stay at homeyet that is but a crushed necessitysince we have locks to safeguard necessariesand pretty traps to catch the petty thieveswhile that the armed hand doth fight abroadthe advised head defends itself at homefor government though high and low and lowerput into parts doth keep in one consentcongreeing in a full and natural closelike musictherefore doth heaven dividethe state of man in divers functionssetting endeavour in continual motionto which is fixed as an aim or buttobedience for so work the honey-beescreatures that by a rule in nature teachthe act of order to a peopled kingdomthey have a king and officers of sortswhere some like magistrates correct at homeothers like merchants venture trade abroadothers like soldiers armed in their stingsmake boot upon the summers velvet budswhich pillage they with merry march bring hometo the tent-royal of their emperorwho busied in his majesty surveysthe singing masons building roofs of goldthe civil tizens kneading up the honeythe poor mechanic porters crowding intheir heavy burdens at his narrow gatethe sad-eyed justice with his surly humdelivering oer to executors palethe lazy yawning drone I this inferthat many things having full referenceto one consent may work contrariouslyas many arrows loosed several waysfly to one mark as many ways meet in one townas many fresh streams meet in one salt seaas many lines close in the dials centreso may a thousand actions once afootend in one purpose and be all well bornewithout defeat therefore to France my liegedivide your happy England into fourwhereof take you one quarter into Franceand you withal shall make all gallia shakeif we with thrice such powers left at homecannot defend our own doors from the doglet us be worried and our nation losethe name of hardiness and policycall in the messengers sent from the Dauphinnow are we well resolved and by Gods helpand yours the noble sinews of our powerfrance being ours well bend it to our aweor break it all to pieces or there well sitruling in large and ample emperyoer France and all her almost kingly dukedomsor lay these bones in an unworthy urntombless with no remembrance over themeither our history shall with full mouthspeak freely of our acts or else our gravelike Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouthnot worshipped with a waxen epitaphnow are we well prepared to know the pleasureof our fair cousin Dauphin for we hearyour greeting is from him not from the kingmayt please your majesty to give us leavefreely to render what we have in chargeor shall we sparingly show you far offthe Dauphins meaning and our embassywe are no tyrant but a christian kingunto whose grace our passion is as subjectas are our wretches fettered in our prisonstherefore with frank and with uncurbed plainnesstell us the Dauphins mindthus then in fewyour highness lately sending into Francedid claim some certain dukedoms in the rightof your great predecessor king Edward the Thirdin answer of which claim the prince our mastersays that you savour too much of your youthand bids you be advised theres nought in Francethat can be with a nimble galliard wonyou cannot revel into dukedoms therehe therefore sends you meeter for your spiritthis tun of treasure and in lieu of thisdesires you let the dukedoms that you claimhear no more of you this the Dauphin speakswhat treasure uncletennis-balls my liegewe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with ushis present and your pains we thank you forwhen we have matched our rackets to these ballswe will in France by Gods grace play a setshall strike his fathers crown into the hazardtell him he hath made a match with such a wranglerthat all the courts of France will be disturbedwith chaces and we understand him wellhow he comes oer us with our wilder daysnot measuring what use we made of themwe never valued this poor seat of Englandand therefore living hence did give ourselfto barbarous licence as itis ever commonthat men are merriest when they are from homebut tell the Dauphin I will keep my statebe like a king and show my sail of greatnesswhen I do rouse me in my throne of Francefor that I have laid by my majestyand plodded like a man for working-daysbut I will rise there with so full a glorythat I will dazzle all the eyes of Franceyea strike the Dauphin blind to look on usand tell the pleasant prince this mock of hishath turned his balls to gun-stones and his soulshall stand sore-charged for the wasteful vengeancethat shall fly with them for many a thousand widowsshall this his mock mock out of their dear husbandsmock mothers from their sons mock castles downand some are yet ungotten and unbornthat shall have cause to curse the Dauphins scornbut this lies all within the will of Godto whom I do appeal and in whose nametell you the Dauphin I am coming onto venge me as I may and to put forthmy rightful hand in a well-hallowed causeso get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphinhis jest will savour but of shallow witwhen thousands weep more than did laugh at itconvey them with safe conduct fare you wellthis was a merry messagewe hope to make the sender blush at ittherefore my lords omit no happy hourthat may give furtherance to our expeditionfor we have now no thought in us but Francesave those to God that run before our businesstherefore let our proportions for these warsbe soon collected and all things thought uponthat may with reasonable swiftness addmore feathers to our wings for God beforewell chide this Dauphin at his fathers doortherefore let every man now task his thoughtthat this fair action may on foot be broughtnow all the youth of England are on fireand silken dalliance in the wardrobe liesnow thrive the armourers and honours thoughtreigns solely in the breast of every manthey sell the pasture now to buy the horsefollowing the mirror of all christian kingswith winged heels as English Mercuriesfor now sits Expectation in the airand hides a sword from hilts unto the pointwith crowns imperial crowns and coronetspromised to Harry and his followersthe French advised by good intelligenceof this most dreadful preparationshake in their fear and with pale policyseek to divert the English purposesO England model to thy inward greatnesslike little body with a mighty heartwhat mightst thou do that honour would thee dowere all thy children kind and naturalbut see thy fault France hath in thee found outa nest of hollow bosoms which he fillswith treacherous crowns and three corrupted menone Richard earl of Cambridge and the secondhenry lord Scroop of Masham and the thirdsir Thomas Grey knight of northumberlandhave for the gilt of France O guilt indeedconfirmed conspiracy with fearful Franceand by their hands this grace of kings must dieif hell and treason hold their promisesere he take ship for France and in Southamptonlinger your patience on and well digestthe abuse of distance while we force a playthe sum is paid the traitors are agreedthe king is set from London and the sceneis now transported gentles to Southamptonthere is the playhouse now there must you sitand thence to France shall we convey you safeand bring you back charming the narrow seasto give you

king but it must be as it may he passes some humours and careerslet us condole the knight for lambkins we will livefore God his grace is bold to trust these traitorsthey shall be apprehended by and

wind fair and we will aboardmy lord of Cambridge and my kind lord of Mashamand you my gentle knight give me your thoughtsthink you not that the powers we bear with uswill cut their passage through the force of Francedoing the execution and the actfor which we have in head assembled themno doubt my liege if each man do his bestI doubt not that since we are well persuadedwe carry not a heart with us from hencethat grows not in a fair consent with oursnor leave not one behind that doth not wishsuccess and conquest to attend on usnever was monarch better feared and lovedthan is your majesty theres not I think a subjectthat sits in heart-grief and uneasinessunder the sweet shade of your governmenttrue those that were your fathers enemieshave steeped their galls in honey and do serve youwith hearts create of duty and of zealwe therefore have great cause of thankfulnessand shall forget the office of our handsooner than quittance of desert and meritaccording to the weight and worthinessso service shall with steeled sinews toiland labour shall refresh itself with hopeto do your grace incessant serviceswe judge no less uncle of Exeterenlarge the man committed yesterdaythat railed against our person we considerit was excess of wine that set him onand on his more advice we pardon himthats mercy but too much securitylet him be punished sovereign lest examplebreed by his sufference more of such a kindO let us yet be merfulso may your highness and yet punish toosiryou show great mercy if you give him lifeafter the taste of much correctionalas your too much love and care of meare heavy orisons gainst this poor wretchif little faults proceeding on distempershall not be winked at how shall we stretch our eyewhen capital crimes chewed swallowed and digestedappear before us well yet enlarge that manthough Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear careand tender preservation of our personwould have him punished and now to our French causeswho are the late commissionersI one my lordyour highness bade me ask for it to-dayso did you me my liegeand I my royal sovereignthen Richard earl of Cambridge there is yoursthere yours lord Scroop of Masham and sir knightgrey of northumberland this same is yoursread them and know I know your worthinessmy lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeterwe will aboard to-night why how now gentlemenwhat see you in those papers that you loseso much complexion look ye how they changetheir cheeks are paper why what read you therethat hath so cowarded and chased your bloodout of appearanceI do confess my faultand do submit me to your highness mercyto which we all appealto which we all appealthe mercy that was quick in us but lateby your own counsel is suppressed and killedyou must not dare for shame to talk of mercyfor your own reasons turn into your bosomsas dogs upon their masters worrying yousee you my princes and my noble peersthese English monsters my lord of Cambridge hereyou know how apt our love was to accordto furnish him with all appertinentsbelonging to his honour and this manhath for a few light crowns lightly conspiredand sworn unto the practices of Franceto kill us here in Hampton to the whichthis knight no less for bounty bound to usthan Cambridge is hath likewise sworn but Owhat shall I say to thee lord Scroop thou cruelingrateful savage and inhuman creaturethou that didst bear the key of all my counselsthat knewest the very bottom of my soulthat almost mightst have coined me into goldwouldst thou have practised on me for thy usemay it be possible that foreign hirecould out of thee extract one spark of evilthat might annoy my finger itis so strangethat though the truth of it stands off as grossas black from white my eye will scarcely see ittreason and murder ever kept togetheras two yoke-devils sworn to eithers purposeworking so grossly in a natural causethat admiration did not whoop at thembut thou gainst all proportion didst bring inwonder to wait on treason and on murderand whatsoever cunning fiend it wasthat wrought upon thee so preposterouslyhath got the voice in hell for excellenceand other devils that suggest by treasonsdo botch and bungle up damnationwith patches colours and with forms being fetchedfrom glistering semblances of pietybut he that tempered thee bade thee stand upgave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treasonunless to dub thee with the name of traitorif that same demon that hath gulled thee thusshould with his lion gait walk the whole worldhe might return to vasty Tartar backand tell the legions I can never wina soul so easy as that Englishmans O how hast thou with jealousy infectedthe sweetness of affiance Show men dutifulwhy so didst thou seem they grave and learnedwhy so didst thou come they of noble familywhy so didst thou seem they religiouswhy so didst thou or are they spare in dietfree from gross passion or of mirth or angerconstant in spirit not swerving with the bloodgarnished and decked in modest complementnot working with the eye without the earand but in purged judgment trusting neithersuch and so finely bolted didst thou seemand thus thy fall hath left a kind of blotto mark the full-fraught man and best induedwith some suspion I will weep for theefor this revolt of thine methinks is likeanother fall of man Their faults are openarrest them to the answer of the lawand God acquit them of their practicesI arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard earl of CambridgeI arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry lord Scroop of MashamI arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey knight of northumberlandour purposes God justly hath discoveredand I repent my fault more than my deathwhich I beseech your highness to forgivealthough my body pay the price of itfor me the gold of France did not seducealthough I did admit it as a motivethe sooner to effect what I intendedbut God be thanked for preventionwhich I in sufference heartily will rejoicebeseeching God and you to pardon menever did faithful subject more rejoiceat the discovery of most dangerous treasonthan I do at this hour joy oer myselfprevented from a damned enterprisemy fault but not my body pardon sovereigngod quit you in his mercy Hear your sentenceyou have conspired against our royal personjoined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffersreceived the golden earnest of our deathwherein you would have sold your king to slaughterhis princes and his peers to servitudehis subjects to oppression and contemptand his whole kingdom into desolationtouching our person seek we no revengebut we our kingdoms safety must so tenderwhose ruin you have sought that to her lawswe do deliver you get you therefore hencepoor miserable wretches to your deaththe taste whereof God of his mercy give youpatience to endure and true repentanceof all your dear offences bear them hencenow lords for France the enterprise whereofshall be to you as us like gloriouswe doubt not of a fair and lucky warsince God so graciously hath brought to lightthis dangerous treason lurking in our wayto hinder our beginnings we doubt not nowbut every rub is smoothed on our waythen forth dear countrymen let us deliverour puissance into the hand of Godputting it straight in expeditioncheerly to sea the signs of war advanceno king of England if not king of Franceprithee honey-sweet husband let me bring thee to Stainesno for my manly heart doth yearnbardolph be blithe Nym rouse thy vaunting veinsboy bristle thy courage up for Falstaff he is deadand we must yearn thereforewould I were with him wheresomeer he is either in heaven or in hellnay sure hes not in hell hes in Arthurs bosom if ever man went to Arthurs bosom a made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child a parted even just between twelve and one even at the turning ofthe tide for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers ends I knew there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a babbled of green fields how now sir John quoth I what man be of good cheer so a cried out God God God three or four times now I to comfort him bid him a should not think of God I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet so a bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone then I felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold as any stonethey say he cried out of sackay that a didand of womennay that a did notyes that a did and said they were devils incarnatea could never abide carnation itwas a colour he never likeda said once the devil would have him about womena did in some sort indeed handle women but then he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylondo you not remember a saw a flea stick upon Bardolphs nose and a said it was a black soul burning in hell-firewell the fuel is gone that maintained that fire thats all the riches I got in his serviceshall we shog the king will be gone from Southamptoncome lets away my love give me thy lipslook to my chattels and my moveableslet senses rule the word is Pitch and pay trust nonefor oaths are straws mens faiths are wafercakesand hold-fast is the only dog my ducktherefore caveto be thy counsellorgo clear thy crystals Yoke-fellows in armslet us to France like horse-leeches my boysto suck to suck the very blood to suckand thats but unwholesome food they saytouch her soft mouth and marchfarewell hostessI cannot kiss that is the humour of it but adieulet housewifery appear keep close I thee commandfarewell adieuthus come the English with full power upon usand more than carefully it us concernsto answer royally in our defencestherefore the dukes of BerrI and Britaineof Brabant and of Orleans shall make forthand you prince Dauphin with all swift dispatchto line and new repair our towns of warwith men of courage and with means defendantfor England his approaches makes as fierceas waters to the sucking of a gulfit fits us then to be as providentas fear may teach us out of late examplesleft by the fatal and neglected Englishupon our fieldsmy most redoubted fatherit is most meet we arm us gainst the foefor peace itself should not so dull a kingdomthough war nor no known quarrel were in questionbut that defences musters preparationsshould be maintained assembled and collectedas were a war in expectationtherefore I say itis meet we all go forthto view the sick and feeble parts of Franceand let us do it with no show of fearno with no more than if we heard that Englandwere busied with a Whitsun morris-dancefor my good liege she is so idly kingedher sceptre so fantastically borneby a vain giddy shallow humorous youththat fear attends her notO peace prince Dauphinyou are too much mistaken in this kingquestion your grace the late ambassadorswith what great state he heard their embassyhow well supplied with noble counsellorshow modest in exception and withalhow terrible in constant resolutionand you shall find his vanities forespentwere but the outside of the Roman Brutuscovering discretion with a coat of follyas gardeners do with ordure hide those rootsthat shall first spring and be most delicatewell itis not so my lord high constablebut though we think it so it is no matterin cases of defence itis best to weighthe enemy more mighty than he seemsso the proportions of defence are filledwhich of a weak and niggardly projectiondoth like a miser spoil his coat with scantinga little cloththink we king Harry strongand princes look you strongly arm to meet himthe kindred of him hath been fleshed upon usand he is bred out of that bloody strainthat haunted us in our familiar pathswitness our too much memorable shamewhen Cressy battle fatally was struckand all our princes captived by the handof that black name Edward Black prince of Waleswhiles that his mounting sire on mountain standingup in the air crowned with the golden sunsaw his heroical seed and smiled to see himmangle the work of nature and defacethe patterns that by God and by French fathershad twenty years been made this is a stemof that victorious stock and let us fearthe native mightiness and fate of himambassadors from Harry king of Englanddo crave admittance to your majestywell give them present audience go and bring themyou see this chase is hotly followed friendsturn head and stop pursuit for coward dogsmost spend their mouths when what they seem to threatenruns far before them Good my sovereigntake up the English short and let them knowof what a monarchy you are the headself-love my liege is not so vile a sinas self-neglectingfrom our brother Englandfrom him and thus he greets your majestyhe wills you in the name of God Almightythat you divest yourself and lay apartthe borrowed glories that by gift of heavenby law of nature and of nations longto him and to his heirs namely the crownand all wide-stretched honours that pertainby custom and the ordinance of timesunto the crown of France that you may knowitis no sinister nor no awkward claimpicked from the worm-holes of long-vanished daysnor from the dust of old oblivion rakedhe sends you this most memorable linein every branch truly demonstrativewilling you overlook this pedigreeand when you find him evenly derivedfrom his most famed of famous ancestorsedward the Third he bids you then resignyour crown and kingdom indirectly heldfrom him the native and true challengeror else what followsbloody constraint for if you hide the crowneven in your hearts there will he rake for ittherefore in fierce tempest is he comingin thunder and in earthquake like a Jovethat if requiring fail he will compeland bids you in the bowels of the lorddeliver up the crown and to take mercyon the poor souls for whom this hungry waropens his vasty jaws and on your headturning the widows tears the orphans criesthe dead mens blood the pining maidens groansfor husbands fathers and betrothed loversthat shall be swallowed in this controversythis is his claim his threatning and my messageunless the Dauphin be in presence hereto whom expressly I bring greeting toofor us we will consider of this furtherto-morrow shall you bear our full intentback to our brother Englandfor the DauphinI stand here for him what to him from Englandscorn and defiance slight regard contemptand anything that may not misbecomethe mighty sender doth he prize you atthus says my king an if your fathers highnessdo not in grant of all demands at largesweeten the bitter mock you sent his majestyhell call you to so hot an answer of itthat caves and womby vaultages of Franceshall chide your trespass and return your mockin second accent of his ordinancesay if my father render fair returnit is against my will for I desirenothing but odds with England to that endas matching to his youth and vanityI did present him with the Paris ballshell make your Paris Louvre shake for itwere it the mistress-court of mighty Europeand be assured youll find a differenceas we his subjects have in wonder foundbetween the promise of his greener daysand these he masters now now he weighs timeeven to the utmost grain that you shall readin your own losses if he stay in Franceto-morrow shall you know our mind at fulldispatch us with all speed lest that our kingcome here himself to question our delayfor he is footed in this land alreadyyou shall be soon dispatched with fair conditionsa night is but small breath and little pauseto answer matters of this consequencethus with imagined wing our swift scene fliesin motion of no less celeritythan that of thought Suppose that you have seenthe well-appointed king at Hampton pierembark his royalty and his brave fleetwith silken streamers the young Phoebus fanningplay with your fanes and in them beholdupon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbinghear the shrill whistle which doth order giveto sounds confused behold the threaden sailsborne with the invisible and creeping winddraw the huge bottoms through the furrowed seabreasting the lofty surge O do but thinkyou stand upon the rivage and beholda ty on the inconstant billows danngfor so appears this fleet majesticalholding due course to Harfleur follow followgrapple your minds to sternage of this navyand leave your England as dead midnight stillguarded with grandsires babies and old womeneither past or not arrived to pith and puissancefor who is he whose chin is but enrichedwith one appearing hair that will not followthose called and choice-drawn cavaliers to Francework work your thoughts and therein see a siegebehold the ordenance on their carriageswith fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleursuppose the ambassador from the French comes backtells Harry that the king doth offer himkatharine his daughter and with her to dowrysome petty and unprofitable dukedomsthe offer likes not and the nimble gunnerwith linstock now the devilish cannon touchesand down goes all before them Still be kindand eke out our performance with your mindonce more unto the breach dear friends once moreor close the wall up with our English deadin peace theres nothing so becomes a manas modest stillness and humilitybut when the blast of war blows in our earsthen imitate the action of the tigerstiffen the sinews summon up the blooddisguise fair nature with hard-favoured ragethen lend the eye a terrible aspectlet it pry through the portage of the headlike the brass cannon let the brow oerwhelm itas fearfully as doth a galled rockoerhang and jutty his confounded baseswilled with the wild and wasteful oceannow set the teeth and stretch the nostril widehold hard the breath and bend up every spiritto his full height on on you noblest Englishwhose blood is fet from fathers of war-prooffathers that like so many Alexandershave in these parts from morn till even foughtand sheathed their swords for lack of argumentdishonour not your mothers now attestthat those whom you called fathers did beget yoube copy now to men of grosser bloodand teach them how to war and you good yeomenwhose limbs were made in England show us herethe mettle of your pasture let us swearthat you are worth your breeding which I doubt notfor there is none of you so mean and basethat hath not noble lustre in your eyesI see you stand like greyhounds in the slipsstraining upon the start the games afootfollow your spirit and upon this chargecry God for Harry England and Saint George on on on on on to the breach to the breachpray thee corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for mine own part I have not a case of lives the humour of it is too hot that is the very plain-song of itthe plain-song is most just for humours do aboundknocks go and come Gods vassals drop and dieand sword and shieldin bloody fielddoth win immortal famewould I were in an alehouse in London I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safetyand Iif wishes would prevail with memy purpose should not fail with mebut thither would I hieas dulybut not as trulyas bird doth sing on boughup to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullionsbe merful great duke to men of mouldabate thy rage abate thy manly rageabate thy rage great dukegood bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuckthese be good humours your honour wins bad humoursas young as I am I have observed these three swashers I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antiques do not amount to a man for Bardolph he is white-livered and red-faced by the means whereof a faces it out but fights not for Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof a breaks words and keeps whole weapons for Nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest a should be thought a coward but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds for a never broke any mans head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk they will steal any thing and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lute-case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three half-pence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals they would have me as familiar with mens pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from anothers pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and seek some better service their villany goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it upcaptain Fluellen you must come presently to the mines the duke of Gloucester would speak with youto the mines tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines for look you the mines is not according to the displines of the war the concavities of it is not suffient for look you th athversary you may discuss unto the duke look you is digt himself four yards under the countermines by Cheshu I think a will plow up all if there is not better directionsthe duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an Irishman a very valiant gentleman infaithit is captain Macmorris is it notI think it beby Cheshu he is an ass as in the worldI will verify as much in his peard he has no more directions in the true displines of the wars look you of the Roman displines than is a puppy-doghere a comes and the Scots captain captain Jamy with himcaptain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in th aunchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions by Cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the displines of the pristine wars of the RomansI say gud day captain Fluellengod-den to your worship good captain Jameshow now captain Macmorris have you quit the mines have the pioners given oerby Chrish la tish ill done the work ish give over the trumpet sound the retreat by my hand I swear and my fathers soul the work ish ill done it ish give over I would have blowed up the town so Chrish save me la in an hour O tish ill done tish ill done by my hand tish ill donecaptain Macmorris I beseech you now will you voutsafeme look you a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the displines of the war the Roman wars in the way of argument look you and friendly communication partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction look you of my mind as touching the direction of the military displine that is the pointit sall be vary gud gud feith gud captains bathand I sall quit you with gud leve as I may pick occasion that sall I marryit is no time to discourse so Chrish save me the day is hot and the weather and the wars and the king and the dukes it is no time to discourse the town is beseeched and the trumpet calls us to the breach and we talk and be Christ do nothing itis shame for us all so God save me itis shame to stand still it is shame by my hand and there is throats to be cut and works to be done and there is nothing donecaptain Macmorris I think look you under your correction there is not many of your nationof my nation what ish my nation ish a villain and a bastard and a knave and a rascal what ish my nation who talks of my nationlook you if you take the matter otherwise than is meant captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me look you being as good a man as yourself both in the displines of wars and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularitiesI do not know you so good a man as myself so Chrish save me I will cut off your headgentlemen both you will mistake each othera thats a foul faultthe town sounds a parleycaptain Macmorris when there is more better opportunity to be required look you I will be so bold as to tell you I know the displines of wars and there is an endhow yet resolves the governor of the townthis is the latest parle we will admittherefore to our best mercy give yourselvesor like to men proud of destructiondefy us to our worst for as I am a soldiera name that in my thoughts becomes me bestif I begin the battery once againI will not leave the half-achieved Harfleurtill in her ashes she lie buriedthe gates of mercy shall be all shut upand the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heartin liberty of bloody hand shall rangewith consence wide as hell mowing like grassyour fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infantswhat is it then to me if impious wararrayed in flames like to the prince of fiendsdo with his smirched complexion all fell featsenlinked to waste and desolationwhat isit to me when you yourselves are causeif your pure maidens fall into the handof hot and forng violationwhat rein can hold licentious wickednesswhen down the hill he holds his fierce careerwe may as bootless spend our vain commandupon the enraged soldiers in their spoilas send precepts to the leviathanto come ashore therefore you men of Harfleurtake pity of your town and of your peoplewhiles yet my soldiers are in my commandwhiles yet the cool and temperate wind of graceoerblows the filthy and contagious cloudsof heady murder spoil and villanyif not why in a moment look to seethe blind and bloody soldier with foul handdefile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughtersyour fathers taken by the silver beardsand their most reverend heads dashed to the wallsyour naked infants spitted upon pikeswhiles the mad mothers with their howls confuseddo break the clouds as did the wives of Jewryat Herods bloody-hunting slaughtermenwhat say you will you yield and this avoidor guilty in defence be thus destroyedour expectation hath this day an endthe Dauphin whom of succour we entreatedreturns us that his powers are yet not readyto raise so great a siege therefore great kingwe yield our town and lives to thy soft mercyenter our gates dispose of us and oursfor we no longer are defensibleopen your gates come uncle Exetergo you and enter Harfleur there remainand fortify it strongly gainst the Frenchuse mercy to them all for us dear unclethe winter coming on and sickness growingupon our soldiers we will retire to Calaisto-night in Harfleur will we be your guestto-morrow for the march are we addrestitis certain he hath passed the river Sommeand if he be not fought withal my lordlet us not live in France let us quit alland give our vineyards to a barbarous peopleO Dieu vivant shall a few sprays of usthe emptying of our fathers luxuryour sons put in wild and savage stockspirt up so suddenly into the cloudsand overlook their graftersnormans but bastard normans norman bastardsmort de ma vie if they march alongunfought withal but I will sell my dukedomto buy a slobbery and a dirty farmin that nook-shotten isle of Albiondieu de battailes where have they this mettleis not their climate foggy raw and dullon whom as in despite the sun looks palekilling their fruit with frowns can sodden watera drench for sur-reined jades their barley-brothdecoct their cold blood to such valiant heatand shall our quick blood spirited with wineseem frosty O for honour of our landlet us not hang like roping iclesupon our houses thatch whiles a more frosty peoplesweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fieldspoor we may call them in their native lordsby faith and honourour madams mock at us and plainly sayour mettle is bred out and they will givetheir bodies to the lust of English youthto new-store France with bastard warriorsthey bid us to the English danng-schoolsand teach lavoltas high and swift corantossaying our grace is only in our heelsand that we are most lofty runawayswhere is Montjoy the herald speed him hencelet him greet England with our sharp defianceup princes and with spirit of honour edgedmore sharper than your swords chide to the fieldcharles Delabreth high Constable of Franceyou dukes of Orleans Bourbon and BerrIalen on Brabant Bar and Burgundyjaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemontbeaumont grandpr RoussI and fauconbergfoix Lestrale Bouqualt and Charoloishigh dukes great princes barons lords and knightsfor your great seats now quit you of great shamesbar Harry England that sweeps through our landwith pennons painted in the blood of Harfleurrush on his host as doth the melted snowupon the valleys whose low vassal seatthe Alps doth spit and void his rheum upongo down upon him you have power enoughand in a captive chariot into Roanbring him our prisonerthis becomes the greatsorry am I his numbers are so fewhis soldiers sick and famished in their marchfor I am sure when he shall see our armyhell drop his heart into the sink of fearand for achievement offer us his ransomtherefore lord constable haste on Montjoyand let him say to England that we sendto know what willing ransom he will giveprince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Roannot so I do beseech your majestybe patient for you shall remain with usnow forth lord constable and princes alland quickly bring us word of Englands fallhow now captain Fluellen come you from the bridgeI assure you there is very excellent services committed at the pridgeis the duke of Exeter safethe duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power he is not God be praised and plessed any hurt in the world but keeps the pridge most valiantly with excellent displine there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge I think in my very consence he is as valiant a man as mark Antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as gallant servicewhat do you call himhe is called Aunchient PistolI know him nothere is the mancaptain I thee beseech to do me favoursthe duke of Exeter doth love thee wellay I praise God and I have merited some love at his handsbardolph a soldier firm and sound of heartand of buxom valour hath by cruel fateand giddy fortunes furious fickle wheelthat goddess blindthat stands upon the rolling restless stoneby your patience Aunchient Pistol fortune is painted plind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that fortune is plind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it fortune is an excellent moralfortune is Bardolphs foe and frowns on himfor he hath stoln a pax and hanged must a bea damned deathlet gallows gape for dog let man go freeand let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocatebut Exeter hath given the doom of deathfor pax of little pricetherefore go speak the duke will hear thy voiceand let not Bardolphs vital thread be cutwith edge of penny cord and vile reproachspeak captain for his life and I will thee requiteaunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaningwhy then rejoice thereforecertainly aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for displine ought to be useddie and be damned and figo for thy friendshipit is wellthe fig of Spainvery goodwhy this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him now a bawd a cutpurseiull assure you a uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summers day but it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is servewhy itis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgraced what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new-tuned oaths and what a beard of the generals cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on but you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistookI tell you what captain Gower I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mindhark you the king is coming and I must speak with him from the pridgogod pless your majestyhow now Fluellen camest thou from the bridgeay so please your majesty the duke of Exeter hath very gallantly maintained the pridge the French is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages Marry th athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I can tell your majesty the duke is a prave manwhat men have you lost Fluellenthe perdition of th athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part I think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph if your majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fires outwe would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winneryou know me by my habitwell then I know thee what shall I know of theemy masters mindunfold itthus says my king Say thou to Harry of England though we seemed dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction to this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounced so far my king and master so much my officewhat is thy name I know thy qualitymontjoythou dost thy office fairly turn thee backand tell thy king I do not seek him nowbut could be willing to march on to Calaiswithout impeachment for to say the sooththough itis no wisdom to confess so muchunto an enemy of craft and vantagemy people are with sickness much enfeebledmy numbers lessened and those few I havealmost no better than so many Frenchwho when they were in health I tell thee heraldI thought upon one pair of English legsdid march three Frenchmen yet forgive me Godthat I do brag thus this your air of Francehath blown that vice in me I must repentgo therefore tell thy master here I ammy ransom is this frail and worthless trunkmy army but a weak and sickly guardyet God before tell him we will come onthough France himself and such another neighbourstand in our way theres for thy labour Montjoygo bid thy master well advise himselfif we may pass we will if we be hinderedwe shall your tawny ground with your red blooddiscolour and so Montjoy fare you wellthe sum of all our answer is but thiswe would not seek a battle as we arenor as we are we say we will not shun itso tell your masterI shall deliver so thanks to your highnessI hope they will not come upon us nowwe are in Gods hand brother not in theirsmarch to the bridge it now draws toward nightbeyond the river well encamp ourselvesand on to-morrow bid them march awaytut I have the best armour of the world would it were dayyou have an excellent armour but let my horse have his dueit is the best horse of Europewill it never be morningmy lord of Orleans and my lord high constable you talk of horse and armouryou are as well provided of both as any prince in the worldwhat a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns a ha he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus quI a les narines de feu when I bestride him I soar I am a hawk he trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermeshes of the colour of the nutmegand of the heat of the ginger it is a beast for Perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beastsindeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horseit is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homageno more cousinnay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all itis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereigns sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus wonder of nature I have heard a sonnet begin so to ones mistressthen did they imitate that which I composed to my courser for my horse is my mistressyour mistress bears wellme well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistressmethought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your backso perhaps did yoursmine was not bridledO then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your straight strossersyou have good judgment in horsemanshipbe warned by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistressI had as lief have my mistress a jadeI tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hairI could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistressthou makest use of any thingyet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purposemy lord constable the armour that I saw in your tent to-night are those stars or suns upon itstars my lordsome of them will fall to-morrow I hopeand yet my sky shall not wantthat may be for you bear a many superfluously and itwere more honour some were awayeven as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismountedwould I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot to-morrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English facesI will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the Englishwho will go to hazard with me for twenty prisonersyou must first go yourself to hazard ere you have themitis midnight iull go arm myselfthe Dauphin longs for morninghe longs to eat the EnglishI think he will eat all he killsby the white hand of my lady hes a gallant princeswear by her foot that she may tread out the oathhe is simply the most active gentleman of Francedoing is activity and he will still be doinghe never did harm that I heard ofnor will do none to-morrow he will keep that good name stillI know him to be valiantI was told that by one that knows him better than youwhats hemarry he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew ithe needs not it is no hidden virtue in himby my faith sir but it is never any body saw it but his lackey itis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bateill will never said wellI will cap that proverb with there is flattery in friendshipand I will take up that with give the devil his duewell placed there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with a pox of the devilyou are the better at proverbs by how much a fools bolt is soon shotyou have shot overitis not the first time you were overshotmy lord high constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tentswho hath measured the groundthe lord grandpriesta valiant and most expert gentleman would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we dowhat a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fatbrained followers so far out of his knowledgeif the English had any apprehension they would run awaythat they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head-piecesthat island of England breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable couragefoolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples you may as well say thats a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lionjust just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devilsay but these English are shrewdly out of beefthen shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight now is it time to arm come shall we about itit is now two oclock but let me see by tenwe shall have each a hundred Englishmennow entertain conjecture of a timewhen creeping murmur and the poring darkfills the wide vessel of the universefrom camp to camp through the foul womb of nightthe hum of either army stilly soundsthat the fixed sentinels almost receivethe secret whispers of each others watchfire answers fire and through their paly flameseach battle sees the others umbered facesteed threatens steed in high and boastful neighspierng the nights dull ear and from the tentsthe armourers accomplishing the knightswith busy hammers closing rivets upgive dreadful note of preparationthe country cocks do crow the clocks do tolland the third hour of drowsy morning nameproud of their numbers and secure in soulthe confident and over-lusty Frenchdo the low-rated English play at diceand chide the cripple tardy-gaited nightwho like a foul and ugly witch doth limpso tediously away the poor condemned Englishlike sacrifices by their watchful firessit patiently and inly ruminatethe mornings danger and their gesture sadinvesting lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coatspresenteth them unto the gazing moonso many horrid ghosts O now who will beholdthe royal captain of this ruined bandwalking from watch to watch from tent to tentlet him cry Praise and glory on his head for forth he goes and visits all his hostbids them good morrow with a modest smileand calls them brothers friends and countrymenupon his royal face there is no notehow dread an army hath enrounded himnor doth he dedicate one jot of colourunto the weary and all-watched nightbut freshly looks and overbears attaintwith cheerful semblance and sweet majestythat every wretch pining and pale beforebeholding him plucks comfort from his looksa largess universal like the sunhis liberal eye doth give to every onethawing cold fear then mean and gentle allbehold as may unworthiness definea little touch of Harry in the nightand so our scene must to the battle flywhere O for pity we shall much disgracewith four or five most vile and ragged foilsright ill disposed in brawl ridiculousthe name of Agincourt yet sit and seeminding true things by what their mockeries begloucester itis true that we are in great dangerthe greater therefore should our courage begood morrow brother Bedford God Almightythere is some soul of goodness in things evilwould men observingly distil it outfor our bad neighbour makes usearly stirrerswhich is both healthful and good husbandrybesides they are our outward consencesand preachers to us all admonishingthat we should dress us fairly for our endthus may we gather honey from the weedand make a moral of the devil himselfgood morrow old sir Thomas Erpinghama good soft pillow for that good white headwere better than a churlish turf of Francenot so my liege this lodging likes me bettersince I may say now lie I like a king itis good for men to love their present painsupon example so the spirit is easedand when the mind is quickened out of doubtthe organs though defunct and dead beforebreak up their drowsy grave and newly movewith casted slough and fresh legeritylend me thy cloak sir Thomas Brothers bothcommend me to the princes in our campdo my good morrow to them and anondesire them all to my pavilionwe shall my liegeshall I attend your graceno my good knightgo with my brothers to my lords of EnglandI and my bosom must debate awhileand then I would no other companythe lord in heaven bless thee noble Harrygod-a-mercy old heart thou speakest cheerfullyquI va la frienddiscuss unto me art thou officeror art thou base common and popularI am a gentleman of a companytrailest thou the puissant pikeeven so what are youas good a gentleman as the emperorthen you are a better than the kingthe kings a bawcock and a heart of golda lad of life an imp of fameof parents good of fist most valiantI kiss his dirty shoe and from my heart-stringI love the lovely bully whats thy nameharry le Royle Roy a Cornish name art thou of Cornish crewno I am a Welshmanknowest thou Fluellenyestell him iull knock his leek about his pateupon Saint Davys daydo not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yoursart thou his friendand his kinsman toothe figo for thee thenI thank you God be with youmy name is Pistol calledit sorts well with your fiercenesscaptain Fluellensol in the name of Cheshu Christ speak lower it is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunent prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble in Pompeys camp I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwisewhy the enemy is loud you heard him all nightif the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own consence nowI will speak lowerI pray you and peseech you that you willthough it appear a little out of fashionthere is much care and valour in this Welshmanbrother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonderI think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of daywe see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it who goes therea friendunder what captain serve youunder sir Thomas Erpinghama good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estateeven as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tidehe hath not told his thought to the kingno nor it is not meet he should for though I speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his armyhe may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as itis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit hereby my troth I will speak my consence of the king I think he would not wish himself any where but where he isthen I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor mens lives savedI dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other mens minds Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honourablethats more than we knoway or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of usbut if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjectionso if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconled iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servants damnation but this is not so the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punished for before-breach of the kings laws in now the kings quarrel where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his consence and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepareitis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer itI do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for himI myself heard the king say he would not be ransomeday he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed and we neer the wiserif I live to see it I will never trust his word afteryou pay him then thats a perilous shot out of an elder-gun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacocks feather youll never trust his word after come itis a foolish sayingyour reproof is something too round I should be angry with you if the time were convenientlet it be a quarrel between us if you liveI embrace ithow shall I know thee againgive me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou darest acknowledge it I will make it my quarrelheres my glove give me another of thinetherethis will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after to-morrow this is my glove by this hand I will take thee a box on the earif ever I live to see it I will challenge itthou darest as well be hangedwell I will do it though I take thee in the kings companykeep thy word fare thee wellbe friends you English fools be friends we have French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckonindeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no English treason to cut French crowns and to-morrow the king himself will be a clipperupon the king let us our lives our soulsour debts our careful wivesour children and our sins lay on the kingwe must bear all O hard conditiontwin-born with greatness subject to the breathof every fool whose sense no more can feelbut his own wringing what infinite hearts easemust kings neglect that private men enjoyand what have kings that privates have not toosave ceremony save general ceremonyand what art thou thou idle ceremonywhat kind of god art thou that sufferest moreof mortal griefs than do thy worshipperswhat are thy rents what are thy comings-inO ceremony show me but thy worthwhat is thy soul of adorationart thou aught else but place degree and formcreating awe and fear in other menwherein thou art less happy being fearedthan they in fearingwhat drinkest thou oft instead of homage sweetbut poisoned flattery O be sick great greatnessand bid thy ceremony give thee curethinkest thou the fiery fever will go outwith titles blown from adulationwill it give place to flexure and low-bendingcanst thou when thou commandest the beggars kneecommand the health of it no thou proud dreamthat playest so subtly with a kings reposeI am a king that find thee and I knowitis not the balm the sceptre and the ballthe sword the mace the crown imperialthe intertissued robe of gold and pearlthe farced title running fore the kingthe throne he sits on nor the tide of pompthat beats upon the high shore of this worldno not all these thrice-gorgeous ceremonynot all these laid in bed majesticalcan sleep so soundly as the wretched slavewho with a body filled and vacant mindgets him to rest crammed with distressful breadnever sees horrid night the child of hellbut like a lackey from the rise to setsweats in the eye of Phoebus and all nightsleeps in Elysium next day after dawndoth rise and help Hyperion to his horseand follows so the ever-running yearwith profitable labour to his graveand but for ceremony such a wretchwinding up days with toil and nights with sleephad the fore-hand and vantage of a kingthe slave a member of the countrys peaceenjoys it but in gross brain little wotswhat watch the king keeps to maintain the peacewhose hours the peasant best advantagesmy lord your nobles jealous of your absenceseek through your camp to find yougood old knightcollect them all together at my tentiull be before theeI shall doit my lordO God of battles steel my soldiers heartspossess them not with fear take from them nowthe sense of reckoning if the opposed numberspluck their hearts from them not to-day O lordO not to-day think not upon the faultmy father made in compassing the crownI Richards body have interred anewand on it have bestowed more contrite tearsthan from it issued forced drops of bloodfive hundred poor I have in yearly paywho twice a day their withered hands hold uptoward heaven to pardon blood and I have builttwo chantries where the sad and solemn priestssing still for Richards soul more will I dothough all that I can do is nothing worthsince that my penitence comes after allimploring pardonmy liegemy brother Gloucesters voice AyI know thy errand I will go with theethe day my friends and all things stay for methe sun doth gild our armour up my lordsO brave spiritnow my lord constablehark how our steeds for present service neighmount them and make insion in their hidesthat their hot blood may spin in English eyesand dout them with superfluous courage hawhat will you have them weep our horses bloodhow shall we then behold their natural tearsthe English are embattailed you French peersto horse you gallant princes straight to horsedo but behold yon poor and starved bandand your fair show shall suck away their soulsleaving them but the shales and husks of menthere is not work enough for all our handsscarce blood enough in all their sickly veinsto give each naked curtal-axe a stainthat our French gallants shall to-day draw outand sheathe for lack of sport let us but blow on themthe vapour of our valour will oerturn themitis positive gainst all exceptions lordsthat our superfluous lackeys and our peasantswho in unnecessary action swarmabout our squares of battle were enowto purge this field of such a hilding foethough we upon this mountains basis bytook stand for idle speculationbut that our honours must not whats to saya very little little let us doand all is done then let the trumpets soundthe tucket sonance and the note to mountfor our approach shall so much dare the fieldthat England shall couch down in fear and yieldwhy do you stay so long my lords of Franceyon island carrions desperate of their bonesill-favouredly become the morning fieldtheir ragged curtains poorly are let looseand our air shakes them passing scornfullybig Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared hostand faintly through a rusty beaver peepsthe horsemen sit like fixed candlestickswith torch-staves in their hand and their poor jadeslob down their heads dropping the hides and hipsthe gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyesand in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bitlies foul with chewed grass still and motionlessand their executors the knavish crowsfly oer them all impatient for their hourdescription cannot suit itself in wordsto demonstrate the life of such a battlein life so lifeless as it shows itselfthey have said their prayers and they stay for deathshall we go send them dinners and fresh suitsand give their fasting horses provenderand after fight with themI stay but for my guard on to the fieldI will the banner from a trumpet takeand use it for my haste come come awaythe sun is high and we outwear the daywhere is the kingthe king himself is rode to view their battleof fighting men they have full three-score thousandtheres five to one besides they all are freshgods arm strike with us itis a fearful oddsgod be wityou princes all iull to my chargeif we no more meet till we meet in heaventhen joyfully my noble lord of Bedfordmy dear lord Gloucester and my good lord Exeterand my kind kinsman warriors all adieufarewell good Salisbury and good luck go with theefarewell kind lord fight valiantly to-dayand yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of itfor thou art framed of the firm truth of valourhe is as full of valour as of kindnessprincely in bothO that we now had herebut one ten thousand of those men in Englandthat do no work to-daywhats he that wishes somy cousin Westmoreland no my fair cousinif we are marked to die we are enowto do our country loss and if to livethe fewer men the greater share of honourgods will I pray thee wish not one man moreby Jove I am not covetous for goldnor care I who doth feed upon my costit yearns me not if men my garments wearsuch outward things dwell not in my desiresbut if it be a sin to covet honourI am the most offending soul aliveno faith my coz wish not a man from Englandgods peace I would not lose so great an honouras one man more methinks would share from mefor the best hope I have O do not wish one morerather proclaim it Westmoreland through my hostthat he which hath no stomach to this fightlet him depart his passport shall be madeand crowns for convoy put into his pursewe would not die in that mans companythat fears his fellowship to die with usthis day is called the feast of Crispianhe that outlives this day and comes safe homewill stand a tip-toe when this day is namedand rouse him at the name of Crispianhe that shall live this day and see old agewill yearly on the vigil feast his neighboursand say to-morrow is Saint Crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scarsand say these wounds I had on Crispins day old men forget yet all shall be forgotbut hell remember with advantageswhat feats he did that day then shall our namesfamiliar in his mouth as household wordsharry the king Bedford and Exeterwarwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucesterbe in their flowing cups freshly rememberedthis story shall the good man teach his sonand Crispin Crispian shall neer go byfrom this day to the ending of the worldbut we in it shall be rememberedwe few we happy few we band of brothersfor he to-day that sheds his blood with meshall be my brother be he neer so vilethis day shall gentle his conditionand gentlemen in England now a-bedshall think themselves accursed they were not hereand hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksthat fought with us upon Saint Crispins daymy sovreign lord bestow yourself with speedthe French are bravely in their battles setand will with all expedience charge on usall things are ready if our minds be soperish the man whose mind is backward nowthou dost not wish more help from England cozgods will my liege would you and I alonewithout more help could fight this royal battlewhy now thou hast unwished five thousand menwhich likes me better than to wish us oneyou know your places God be with you allonce more I come to know of thee king Harryif for thy ransom thou wilt now compoundbefore thy most assured overthrowfor certainly thou art so near the gulfthou needs must be englutted besides in mercythe constable desires thee thou wilt mindthy followers of repentance that their soulsmay make a peaceful and a sweet retirefrom off these fields where wretches their poor bodiesmust lie and festerwho hath sent thee nowthe Constable of FranceI pray thee bear my former answer backbid them achieve me and then sell my bonesgood God why should they mock poor fellows thusthe man that once did sell the lions skinwhile the beast lived was killed with hunting hima many of our bodies shall no doubtfind native graves upon the which I trustshall witness live in brass of this days workand those that leave their valiant bones in Francedying like men though buried in your dung-hillsthey shall be famed for there the sun shall greet themand draw their honours reeking up to heavenleaving their earthly parts to choke your climethe smell whereof shall breed a plague in Francemark then abounding valour in our Englishthat being dead like to the bullets grazingbreak out into a second course of mischiefkilling in relapse of mortalitylet me speak proudly tell the constablewe are but warriors for the working-dayour gayness and our gilt are all besmirchedwith rainy marching in the painful fieldtheres not a piece of feather in our hostgood argument I hope we will not flyand time hath worn us into slovenrybut by the mass our hearts are in the trimand my poor soldiers tell me yet ere nighttheyll be in fresher robes or they will pluckthe gay new coats oer the French soldiers headsand turn them out of service if they do thisas if God please they shall my ransom thenwill soon be levied Herald save thou thy labourcome thou no more for ransom gentle heraldthey shall have none I swear but these my jointswhich if they have as I will leave em themshall yield them little tell the constableI shall king Harry and so fare thee wellthou never shalt hear herald any moreI fear thoult once more come again for ransommy lord most humbly on my knee I begthe

he hath fallen into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave valorous and thrice-worthy signieur of Englandas I suck blood I will some mercy showfollow meI did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart but the saying is true the empty vessel makes the greatest sound Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil inthe old play that every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger and they are both hanged and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp the French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boysall is confounded allreproach and everlasting shamesit mocking in our plumes O meschante fortunedo not run awaywhy all our ranks are brokeO perdurable shame lets stab ourselvesbe these the wretches that we played at dice foris this the king we sent to for his ransomshame and eternal shame nothing but shamelets die in honour once more back againand he that will not follow Bourbon nowlet him go hence and with his cap in handlike a base pander hold the chamber-doorwhilst by a slave no gentler than my doghis fairest daughter is contaminateddisorder that hath spoiled us friend us nowlet us on heaps go offer up our liveswe are enough yet living in the fieldto smother up the English in our throngsif any order might be thought uponthe devil take order now iull to the thronglet life be short else shame will be too longwell have we done thrice-valiant countrymenbut alls not done yet keep the French the fieldthe duke of York commends him to your majestylives he good uncle thrice within this hourI saw him down thrice up again and fightingfrom helmet to the spur all blood he wasin which array brave soldier doth he lielarding the plain and by his bloody sideYoke-fellow to his honour-owing woundsthe noble earl of Suffolk also liessuffolk first died and York all haggled overcomes to him where in gore he lay insteepedand takes him by the beard kisses the gashesthat bloodily did yawn upon his faceand cries aloud Tarry dear cousin Suffolkmy soul shall thine keep company to heaventarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreastas in this glorious and well-foughten fieldwe kept together in our chivalry upon these words I came and cheered him uphe smiled me in the face raught me his handand with a feeble gripe says edear my lordcommend my service to my sovereign so did he turn and over Suffolks neckhe threw his wounded arm and kissed his lipsand so espoused to death with blood he sealeda testament of noble-ending lovethe pretty and sweet manner of it forcedthose waters from me which I would have stoppedbut I had not so much of man in meand all my mother came into mine eyesand gave me up to tearsI blame you notfor hearing this I must perforce compoundwith mistful eyes or they will issue toobut hark what new alarum is this samethe French have reinforced their scattered menthen every soldier kill his prisonersgive the word throughkill the poys and the luggage itis expressly against the law of arms itis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offert in your consence now is it notitis certain theres not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle have done this slaughter besides they have burned and carried away all that was in the kings tent wherefore the king most worthily hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoners throat O itis a gallant kingay he was porn at Monmouth captain Gower what call you the towns name where Alexander the Pig was bornalexander the greatwhy I pray you is not pig great the pig or the great or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous are all one reckonings save the phrase is a little variationsI think Alexander the great was born in Macedon his father was called Philip of Macedon as I take itI think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn I tell you captain if you look in the maps of the orld I warrant you sall find in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth that the situations look you is both alike there is a river in Macedon and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth it is called Wye at Monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but itis all one itis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both if you mark Alexanders life well Harry of Monmouths life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his pest friend Cleitusour king is not like him in that he never killed any of his friendsit is not well done mark you now to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus being in his ales and his cups so also Harry Monmouth being in his right wits and his good judgments turned away the fat knight with the great belly-doublet he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries and mocks I have forgot his namesir John Falstaffthat is he iull tell you there is goot men porn at Monmouthhere comes his majestyI was not angry since I came to Franceuntil this instant take a trumpet heraldride thou unto the horsemen on yon hillif they will fight with us bid them come downor void the field they do offend our sightif theyll do neither we will come to themand make them skirr away as swift as stonesenforced from the old Assyrian slingsbesides well cut the throats of those we haveand not a man of them that we shall takeshall taste our mercy go and tell them sohere comes the herald of the French my liegehis eyes are humbler than they used to behow now what means this herald knowest thou notthat I have fined these bones of mine for ransomcomest thou again for ransomno great kingI come to thee for charitable licencethat we may wander oer this bloody fieldto book our dead and then to bury themto sort our nobles from our common menfor many of our princes woe the whilelie drowned and soaked in mercenary bloodso do our vulgar drench their peasant limbsin blood of princes and their wounded steedsfret fetlock-deep in gore and with wild rageYerk out their armed heels at their dead masterskilling them twice O give us leave great kingto view the field in safety and disposeof their dead bodiesI tell thee truly heraldI know not if the day be ours or nofor yet a many of your horsemen peerand gallop oer the fieldthe day is yourspraised be God and not our strength for itwhat is this castle called that stands hard bythey call it Agincourtthen call we this the field of Agincourtfought on the day of Crispin Crispianusyour grandfather of famous memory

my office hath so far prevailedthat face to face and royal eye to eyeyou have congreeted let it not disgrace meif I demand before this royal viewwhat rub or what impediment there iswhy that the naked poor and mangled peacedear nurse of arts plenties and joyful birthsshould not in this best garden of the worldour fertile France put up her lovely visagealas she hath from France too long been chasedand all her husbandry doth lie on heapscorrupting in its own fertilityher vine the merry cheerer of the heartunpruned dies her hedges even-pleachedlike prisoners wildly overgrown with hairput forth disordered twigs her fallow leasthe darnel hemlock and rank fumitorydoth root upon while that the coulter ruststhat should deranate such savagerythe even mead that erst brought sweetly forththe freckled cowslip burnet and green cloverwanting the scythe all uncorrected rankconceives by idleness and nothing teemsbut hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burslosing both beauty and utilityand as our vineyards fallows meads and hedgesdefective in their natures grow to wildnesseven so our houses and ourselves and childrenhave lost or do not learn for want of timethe sences that should become our countrybut grow like savages as soldiers willthat nothing do but meditate on bloodto swearing and stern looks diffused attireand every thing that seems unnaturalwhich to reduce into our former favouryou are assembled and my speech entreatsthat I may know the let why gentle peaceshould not expel these inconveniencesand bless us with her former qualitiesif duke of Burgundy you would the peacewhose want gives growth to the imperfectionswhich you have ted you must buy that peacewith full accord to all our just demandswhose tenours and particular effectsyou have enscheduled briefly in your handsthe king hath heard them to the which as yetthere is no answer madewell then the peacewhich you before so urged lies in his answerI have but with a cursorary eyeoerglanced the articles pleaseth your graceto appoint some of your counselpresentlyto sit with us once more with better heedto re-survey them we will suddenlypass our accept and peremptory answerbrother we shall go uncle Exeterand brother Clarence and you brother Gloucesterwarwick and Huntingdon go with the kingand take with you free power to ratifyaugment or alter as your wisdoms bestshall see advantageable for our dignityanything in or out of our demandsand well consign thereto Will you fair sistergo with the princes or stay here with usour gracious brother I will go with themhaply a womans voice may do some goodwhen articles too nicely urged be stood onyet leave our cousin Katharine here with usshe is our capital demand comprisedwithin the fore-rank of our articlesshe hath good leavefair Katharine and most fairwill you vouchsafe to teach a soldier termssuch as will enter at a ladys earand plead his love-suit to her gentle heartyour majesty sall mock at me I cannot speak your EnglandO fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue do you like me Katepardonnez moy I cannot tell vat is like me an angel is like you Kate and you are like an angelque dit-il que je suis semblable les angesouy vrayment sauf vostre grace ainsI dit-ilI said so dear Katharine and I must not blush to affirm itO bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines des tromperieswhat says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceitsouy dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princessthe princess is the better Englishwoman infaith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say I love you then if you urge me further than to say edo you in faith I wear out my suit give me your answer infaith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you ladysauf vostre honneur me understand vellmarry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength if I could win a lady at leap-frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes never off but before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urged nor never break for urging if thou caust love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sun-burning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet I love thee too and while thou livest dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rime themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again what a speaker is but a prater a rime is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king and what sayest thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly I pray theeis it possible dat I sould love de enemy of Franceno it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mineI cannot tell vat is datno Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husbands neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moy let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed donc vostre est France et vous estes mienne it is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at mesauf vostre honneur le Fran ois que vous parlez est meilleur que langlois lequel je parleno faith isit not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but Kate dost thou understand thus much English Canst thou love meI cannot tellcan any of your neighbours tell Kate iull ask them come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet youll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart but good Kate mock me merfully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly if ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard shall we not what sayest thou my fair flower-de-luceI do not know datno itis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer younow file upon my false French by mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage now beshrew my fathers ambition he was thinking of vile wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them but in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer-up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair Katharine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore queen of all Katharine break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me nay it will please him well Kate it shall please him Kateden it sall also content meupon that I kiss your hand and I call you my queenthen I will kiss your lips Katemadam my interpreter what says sheto kissyour majestyit is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married would she sayO Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings dear Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a countrys fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouths of all find-faults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yieldingyou have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French counseland they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs here comes your fathergod save your majesty my royal cousin teach you our princess EnglishI would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good Englishis she not aptour tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likenesspardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that if you would conjure in her you must make a rcle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self it were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign toyet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforcesthey are then excused my lord when they see not what they dothen good my lord teach your cousin to consent winkingI will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summered and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomew-tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking onthis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind tooas love is my lord before it lovesit is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair French ty for one fair French maid that stands in my wayyes my lord you see them perspectively the ties turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never enteredshall Kate be my wifeso please youI am content so the maiden ties you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my willwe have consented to all terms of reasonisit so my lords of Englandthe king hath granted every articlehis daughter first and then in sequel allaccording to their firm proposed naturesonly he hath not yet subscribed thiswhere your majesty demands that the king of France having any occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your highness in this form and with this additionnor this I have not brother so deniedbut your request shall make me let it passI pray you then in love and dear alliancelet that one article rank with the restand thereupon give me your daughtertake her fair son and from her blood raise upissue to me that the contending kingdomsof France and England whose very shores look palewith envy of each others happinessmay cease their hatred and this dear conjunctionplant neighbourhood and christian-like accordin their sweet bosoms that never war advancehis bleeding sword btwixt England and fair Franceamennow welcome Kate and bear me witness allthat here I kiss her as my sovereign queengod the best maker of all marriagescombine your hearts in one your realms in oneas man and wife being two are one in loveso be there btwixt your kingdoms such a spousalthat never may ill office or fell jealousywhich troubles oft the bed of blessed marriagethrust in between the paction of these kingdomsto make divorce of their incorporate leaguethat English may as French French Englishmenreceive each other God speak this amenamenprepare we for our marriage on which daymy lord of Burgundy well take your oathand all the peers for surety of our leaguesthen shall I swear to Kate and you to meand may our oaths well kept and prosperous bethus far with rough and all-unable penour bending author hath pursued the storyin little room confining mighty menmangling by starts the full course of their glorysmall time but in that small most greatly livedthis star of England fortune made his swordby which the worlds best garden he achievedand of it left his son imperial lordhenry the Sixth in infant bands crowned kingof France and England did this king succeedwhose state so many had the managingthat they lost France and made his England bleedwhich oft our stage hath shown and for their sakein your fair minds let this acceptance takeopen your ears for which of you will stopthe vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaksI from the orient to the drooping westmaking the wind my post-horse still unfoldthe acts commenced on this ball of earthupon my tongues continual slanders ridethe which in every language I pronouncestuffing the ears of men with false reportsI speak of peace while covert enmityunder the smile of safety wounds the worldand who but Rumour who but only Imake fearful musters and prepared defencewhilst the big year swoln with some other griefis thought with child by the stern tyrant warand no such matter Rumour is a pipeblown by surmises jealousies conjecturesand of so easy and so plain a stopthat the blunt monster with uncounted headsthe still-discordant wavering multitudecan play upon it but what need I thusmy well-known body to anatomizeamong my household why is Rumour hereI run before king Harrys victorywho in a bloody field by Shrewsburyhath beaten down young Hotspur and his troopsquenching the flame of bold rebellioneven with the rebels blood but what mean Ito speak so true at first my office isto noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fellunder the wrath of noble Hotspurs swordand that the king before the Douglas ragestooped his anointed head as low as deaththis have I rumoured through the peasant townsbetween the royal field of Shrewsburyand this worm-eaten hold of ragged stonewhere Hotspurs father old northumberlandlies crafty-sick the posts come tiring onand not a man of them brings other newsthan they have learned of me from Rumours tonguesthey bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongswho keeps the gate here howhere is the earlwhat shall I say you aretell thou the earlthat the lord Bardolph doth attend him herehis lordship is walked forth into the orchardplease it your honour knock but at the gateand he himself will answerhere comes the earlwhat news lord Bardolph every minute nowshould be the father of some stratagemthe times are wild contention like a horsefull of high feeding madly hath broke looseand bears down all before himnoble earlI bring you certain news from Shrewsburygood an God willas good as heart can wishthe king is almost wounded to the deathand in the fortune of my lord your sonprince Harry slain outright and both the Bluntskilled by the hand of Douglas young prince Johnand Westmoreland and Stafford fled the fieldand Harry Monmouths brawn the hulk sir Johnis prisoner to your son O such a dayso fought so followed and so fairly woncame not till now to dignify the timessince Ceasars fortuneshow is this derivedsaw you the field came you from ShrewsburyI spake with one my lord that came from thencea gentleman well bred and of good namethat freely rendered me these news for truehere comes my servant Travers whom I senton Tuesday last to listen after newsmy lord I over-rode him on the wayand he is furnished with no certaintiesmore than he haply may retail from menow Travers what good tidings come with youmy lord sir John Umfrevile turned me backwith joyful tidings and being better horsedout-rode me after him came spurring harda gentleman almost forspent with speedthat stopped by me to breathe his bloodied horsehe asked the way to Chester and of himI did demand what news from Shrewsburyhe told me that rebellion had bad luckand that young Harry Percys spur was coldwith that he gave his able horse the headand bending forward struck his armed heelsagainst the panting sides of his poor jadeup to the rowel-head and starting sohe seemed in running to devour the waystaying no longer questionha Againsaid he young Harry Percys spur was coldof Hotspur Coldspur that rebellionhad met ill luckmy lord iull tell you whatif my young lord your son have not the dayupon mine honour for a silken pointiull give my barony never talk of itwhy should the gentleman that rode by Traversgive then such instances of losswho hehe was some hilding fellow that had stolenthe horse he rode on and upon my lifespoke at a venture look here comes more newsyea this mans brow like to a title-leafforetells the nature of a tragic volumeso looks the strond whereon the imperious floodhath left a witnessed usurpationsay Morton didst thou come from ShrewsburyI ran from Shrewsbury my noble lordwhere hateful death put on his ugliest maskto fright our partyhow doth my son and brotherthou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheekis apter than thy tongue to tell thy errandeven such a man so faint so spiritlessso dull so dead in look so woe-begonedrew Priams curtain in the dead of nightand would have told him half his Troy was burnedbut Priam found the fire ere he his tongueand I my Percys death ere thou reportest itthis thou wouldst say your son did thus and thusyour brother thus so fought the noble Douglas stopping my greedy ear with their bold deedsbut in the end to stop mine ear indeedthou hast a sigh to blow away this praiseending with Brother son and all are dead douglas is living and your brother yetbut for my lord your sonwhy he is deadsee what a ready tongue suspion hathhe that but fears the thing he would not knowhath by instinct knowledge from others eyesthat what he feared is chanced yet speak Mortontell thou thy earl his divination liesand I will take it as a sweet disgraceand make thee rich for doing me such wrongyou are too great to be by me gainsaidyour spirit is too true your fears too certainyet for all this say not that Percys deadI see a strange confession in thine eyethou shakest thy head and holdest it fear or sinto speak a truth if he be slain say sothe tongue offends not that reports his deathand he doth sin that doth belie the deadnot he which says the dead is not aliveyet the first bringer of unwelcome newshath but a losing office and his tonguesounds ever after as a sullen bellremembered knolling a departing friendI cannot think my lord your son is deadI am sorry I should force you to believethat which I would to God I had not seenbut these mine eyes saw him in bloody staterendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathedto Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat downthe never-daunted Percy to the earthfrom whence with life he never more sprung upin few his death whose spirit lent a fireeven to the dullest peasant in his campbeing bruited once took fire and heat awayfrom the best-tempered courage in his troopsfor from his metal was his party steeledwhich once in him abated all the restturned on themselves like dull and heavy leadand as the thing thats heavy in itselfupon enforcement flies with greatest speedso did our men heavy in Hotspurs losslend to this weight such lightness with their fearthat arrows fled not swifter toward their aimthan did our soldiers aiming at their safetyfly from the field then was that noble Worcestertoo soon taen prisoner and that furious Scotthe bloody Douglas whose well-labouring swordhad three times slain the appearance of the kinggan vail his stomach and did grace the shameof those that turned their backs and in his flightstumbling in fear was took the sum of allis that the king hath won and hath sent outa speedy power to encounter you my lordunder the conduct of young Lancasterand Westmoreland this is the news at fullfor this I shall have time enough to mournin poison there is physic and these newshaving been well that would have made me sickbeing sick have in some measure made me welland as the wretch whose fever-weakened jointslike strengthless hinges buckle under lifeimpatient of his fit breaks like a fireout of his keepers arms even so my limbsweakened with grief being now enraged with griefare thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutcha scaly gauntlet now with joints of steelmust glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoifthou art a guard too wanton for the headwhich princes fleshed with conquest aim to hitnow bind my brows with iron and approachthe raggedest hour that time and spite dare bringto frown upon the enraged northumberlandlet heaven kiss earth now let not natures handkeep the wild flood confined let order dieand let this world no longer be a stageto feed contention in a lingering actbut let one spirit of the first-born Cainreign in all bosoms that each heart being seton bloody courses the rude scene may endand darkness be the burier of the deadthis strained passion doth you wrong my lordsweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honourthe lives of all your loving compliceslean on your health the which if you give oerto stormy passion must perforce decayyou cast the event of war my noble lordand summed the account of chance before you saidlet us make head it was your presurmisethat in the dole of blows your son might dropyou knew he walked oer perils on an edgemore likely to fall in than to get oeryou were advised his flesh was capableof wounds and scars and that his forward spiritwould lift him where most trade of danger rangedyet did you say go forth and none of thisthough strongly apprehended could restrainthe stiff-borne action what hath then befallenor what hath this bold enterprise brought forthmore than that being which was like to bewe all that are engaged to this lossknew that we ventured on such dangerous seasthat if we wrought out life itwas ten to oneand yet we ventured for the gain proposedchoked the respect of likely peril fearedand since we are oerset venture againcome we will all put forth body and goodsitis more than time and my most noble lordI hear for certain and do speak the truththe gentle Archbishop of York is upwith well-appointed powers he is a manwho with a double surety binds his followersmy lord your son had only but the corpsebut shadows and the shows of men to fightfor that same word rebellion did dividethe action of their bodies from their soulsand they did fight with queasiness constrainedas men drink potions that their weapons onlyseemed on our side but for their spirits and soulsthis word rebellion it had froze them upas fish are in a pond but now the bishopturns insurrection to religionsupposed sincere and holy in his thoughtshes followed both with body and with mindand doth enlarge his rising with the bloodof fair king Richard scraped from Pomfret stonesderives from heaven his quarrel and his causetells them he doth bestride a bleeding landgasping for life under great Bolingbrokeand more and less do flock to follow himI knew of this before but to speak truththis present grief had wiped it from my mindgo in with me and counsel every manthe aptest way for safety and revengeget posts and letters and make friends with speednever so few and never yet more needsirrah you giant what says the doctor to my waterhe said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the party that owed it he might have more diseases than he knew formen of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of this foolish-compounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I have no judgment thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never manned with an agate till now but I will set you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledged I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal God may finish it when he will it is not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still as a face-royal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet he will be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he may keep his own grace but he is almost out of mine I can assure him what said master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slopshe said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph he would not take his bond and yours he liked not the securitylet him be damned like the glutton may his tongue be hotter a whoreson Achitophel a rascally yea-forsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security the whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is thorough with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security I looked a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him wheres Bardolphhes gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horseI bought him in Pauls and hell buy me a horse in Smithfield an I could get me but a wife in the stews I were manned horsed and wivedsir here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for striking him about Bardolphwait close I will not see himwhats he that goes therefalstaff ant please your lordshiphe that was in question for the robberyhe my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to the lord John of Lancasterwhat to York call him back againsir John Falstaffboy tell him I am deafyou must speak louder my master is deafI am sure he is to the hearing of anything good go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with himsir Johnwhat a young knave and beg is there not wars is there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the rebels want soldiers though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make ityou mistake me sirwhy sir did I say you were an honest man setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said soI pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest manI give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me if thou gettest any leave of me hang me if thou takest leave thou wert better be hanged you hunt-counter hence avauntsir my lord would speak with yousir John Falstaff a word with youmy good lord God give your lordship good time of day I am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice your lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your healthsir John I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsburyant please your lordship I hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from WalesI talk not of his majesty you would not come when I sent for youand I hear moreover his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexywell heaven mend him I pray you let me speak with youthis apoplexy is as I take it a kind of lethargy ant please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tinglingwhat tell you me of it be it as it isit hath its original from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects in galen it is a kind of deafnessI think you are fallen into the disease for you hear not what I say to youvery well my lord very well rather ant please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled withalto punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and I care not if I do become your physianI am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itselfI sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with meas I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service I did not comewell the truth is sir John you live in great infamyhe that buckles him in my belt cannot live in lessyour means are very slender and your waste is greatI would it were otherwise I would my means were greater and my waist slendereryou have misled the youthful princethe young prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the great belly and he my dogwell I am loath to gall a new-healed wound your days service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your nights exploit on gadshill you may thank the unquiet time for your quiet oer-posting that actionmy lordbut since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolfto wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a foxwhat you are as a candle the better part burnt outa wassail candle my lord all tallow if I did say of wax my growth would approve the truththere is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravityhis effect of gravy gravy gravyyou follow the young prince up and down like his ill angelnot so my lord your ill angel is light but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell virtue is of so little regard in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry you that are old consider not the capaties of us that are young you measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth I must confess are wags toodo you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity and will you yet call yourself young fie fie fie sir Johnmy lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly for my voice I have lost it with hollaing and singing of anthems to approve my youth further I will not the truth is I am only old in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him for the box ofthe ear that the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have checked him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sackwell God send the prince a better companiongod send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my hands of himwell the king hath severed you and prince Harry I hear you are going with lord John of Lancaster against the archbishop and the earl of northumberlandyea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it but look you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day for by the lord I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily if it be a hot day and I brandish anything but my bottle I would I might never spit white again there is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it well I cannot last ever but it was always yet the trick of our English nation if they have a good thing to make it too common if you will needs say I am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be eaten to death with rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motionwell be honest be honest and God bless your expeditionwill your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forthnot a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses fare you well commend me to my cousin Westmorelandif I do fillip me with a three-man beetle a man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses boysirwhat money is in my purseseven groats and twopenceI can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable go bear this letter to my lord of Lancaster this to the prince this to the earl of Westmoreland and this to old mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin About it you know where to find mea pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe itis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable a good wit will make use of anything I will turn diseases to commoditythus have you heard our cause and known our meansand my most noble friends I pray you allspeak plainly your opinions of our hopesand first lord Marshal what say you to itI well allow the occasion of our armsbut gladly would be better satisfiedhow in our means we should advance ourselvesto look with forehead bold and big enoughupon the power and puissance of the kingour present musters grow upon the fileto five-and-twenty thousand men of choiceand our supplies live largely in the hopeof great northumberland whose bosom burnswith an incensed fire of injuriesthe question then lord hastings standeth thuswhether our present five-and-twenty thousandmay hold up head without northumberlandwith him we mayay marry theres the pointbut if without him we be thought too feeblemy judgment is we should not step too fartill we had his assistance by the handfor in a theme so bloody-faoed as thisconjecture expectation and surmiseof aids incertain should not be admitteditis very true lord Bardolph for indeedit was young Hotspurs case at Shrewsburyit was my lord who lined himself with hopeeating the air on promise of supplyflattering himself with project of a powermuch smaller than the smallest of his thoughtsand so with great imaginationproper to madmen led his powers to deathand winking leaped into destructionbut by your leave it never yet did hurtto lay down likelihoods and forms of hopeyes if this present quality of warindeed the instant action a cause on footlives so in hope as in an early springwe see the appearing buds which to prove fruithope gives not so much warrant as despairthat frosts will bite them when we mean to buildwe first survey the plot then draw the modeland when we see the figure of the housethen must we rate the cost of the erectionwhich if we find outweighs abilitywhat do we then but draw anew the modelin fewer offices or at last desistto build at all Much more in this great workwhich is almost to pluck a kingdom downand set another up should we surveythe plot of situation and the modelconsent upon a sure foundationquestion surveyors know our own estatehow able such a work to undergoto weigh against his opposite or elsewe fortify in paper and in figuresusing the names of men instead of menlike one that draws the model of a housebeyond his power to build it who half throughgives oer and leaves his part-created costa naked-subject to the weeping cloudsand waste for churlish winters tyrannygrant that our hopes yet likely of fair birthshould be still-born and that we now possessedthe utmost man of expectationI think we are a body strong enougheven as we are to equal with the kingwhat is the king but five-and-twenty thousandto us no more nay not so much lord Bardolphfor his divisions as the times do brawlare in three heads one power against the Frenchand one against Glendower perforce a thirdmust take up us so is the unfirm kingin three divided and his coffers soundwith hollow poverty and emptinessthat he should draw his several strengths togetherand come against us in full puissanceneed not be dreadedif he should do sohe leaves his back unarmed the French and Welshbaying him at the heels never fear thatwho is it like should lead his forces hitherthe duke of Lancaster and Westmorelandagainst the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouthbut who is substituted gainst the FrenchI have no certain noticelet us onand publish the occasion of our armsthe commonwealth is sick of their own choicetheir over-greedy love hath surfeiteda habitation giddy and unsurehath he that buildeth on the vulgar heartO thou fond many with what loud applausedidst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbrokebefore he was what thou wouldst have him beand being now trimmed in thine own desiresthou beastly feeder art so full of himthat thou provokest thyself to cast him upso so thou common dog didst thou disgorgethy glutton bosom of the royal Richardand now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit upand howlest to find it what trust is in these timesthey that when Richard lived would have him dieare now become enamoured on his gravethou that threwest dust upon his goodly headwhen through proud London he came sighing onafter the admired heels of Bolingbrokecryest now O earth yield us that king againand take thou this O thoughts of men accurstpast and to come seem best things present worstshall we go draw our numbers and set onwe are times subjects and time bids be gonemaster fang have you entered the exionit is enteredwheres your yeoman is it a lusty yeoman will a stand toitsirrah wheres SnareO lord ay good master Snarehere heresnare we must arrest sir John Falstaffyea good master Snare I have entered him and allit may chance cost some of us our lives for he will stabalas the day take heed of him he

have any vantage of ground to get uphow comes this sir John fie what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her ownwhat is the gross sum that I owe theemarry if thou wert an honest man thyself and the money too thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet sitting in my Dolphin-chamber at the round table by a seacoal fire upon Wednesday in Wheeson week when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of windsor thou didst swear to me then as I was washing thy wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife Canst thou deny it did not goodwife Keech the butchers wife come in then and call me gossip quickly coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns whereby thou didst desire to eat some whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound and didst thou not when she was gone down-stairs desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people saying that ere long they should call me madam and didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings I put thee now to thy book-oath deny it if thou canstmy lord this is a poor mad soul and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you she hath been in good case and the truth is poverty hath distracted her but for these foolish officers I beseech you I may have redress against themsir John sir John I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way it is not a confident brow nor the throng of words that

uses both in purse and in personyea in troth my lordprithee peace Pay her the debt you owe her and unpay the villany you have done her the one you may do with sterling money and the other with current repentancemy lord I will not undergo this sneap without reply you call honourable boldness impudent sauness if a man will make curtsy and say nothing he is virtuous no my lord my humble duty remembered I will not be your suitor I say to you I do desire deliverance from these officers being upon hasty employment in the kings affairsyou speak as having power to do wrong but answer in the

Johnmaster Gower if they become me not he was a fool that taught them me this is the right fenng grace my lord tap for tap and so part fairnow the lord lighten thee thou art a great foolbefore God I am exceeding wearyis it come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high bloodfaith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beerwhy a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a compositionbelike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face to-morrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy peach-coloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and one other for use but that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low-countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthenedhow ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time isshall I tell thee one thing Poinsyes faith and let it be an excellent good thingit shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thinego to I stand the push of your one thing that you will tellmarry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could be sad and sad indeed toovery hardly upon such a subjectby this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devils book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man but I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrowthe reasonwhat wouldst thou think of me if I should weepI would think thee a most princely hypocriteit would be every mans thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a mans thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine every man would think me a hypocrite indeed and what actes your most worshipful thought to think sowhy because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaffand to theeby this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine own ears the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and these two things I confess I cannot help by the mass here comes Bardolphand the boy that I gave Falstaff a had him from me christian and look if the fat villain have not transformed him apegod save your graceand yours most noble Bardolphcome you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing wherefore blush you now what a maidenly man-at-arms are you become is it such a matter to get a pottle-pots maidenheada calls me even now my lord through a red lattice and I could discern no part of his face from the window at last I spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wifes new petticoat and peeped throughhath not the boy profitedaway you whoreson upright rabbit awayaway you rascally Altheas dream awayinstruct us boy what dream boymarry my lord Althea dreamed she was delivered of a firebrand and therefore I call him her dreama crowns worth of good interpretation there it is boyO that this good blossom could be kept from cankers well there is sixpence to preserve theean you do

and how doth the martlemas your masterin bodily health sirmarry the immortal part needs a physian but that moves not him though that be sick it dies notI do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how he writesjohn Falstaff knight every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are akin to the king for they never prick their finger but they say there is some of the kings blood spilt how comes that says he that takes upon him not to conceive the answer is as ready as a borrowers cap I am the kings poor cousin sir nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from Japhet but to the lettersir John Falstaff knight to the son of the king nearest his father Harry prince of Wales greeting why this is a certificatepeaceI will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity sure he means brevity in breath short-winded I commend me to thee I commend thee and I leave thee be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou mayest and so farewellmy lord iull steep this letter in sack and make him eat itthats to make him eat twenty of his words but do you use me thus Ned must I marry your sistergod send the wench no worse fortune but I never said sowell thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits

poorest subjectsare at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleepnatures soft nurse how have I frighted theethat thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids downand steep my senses in forgetfulnesswhy rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribsupon uneasy pallets stretching theeand hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumberthan in the perfumed chambers of the greatunder the canopies of costly stateand lulled with sound of sweetest melodyO thou dull god why liest thou with the vilein loathsome beds and leavest the kingly coucha watch-case or a common larum bellwilt thou upon the high and giddy mastseel up the ship-boys eyes and rock his brainsin cradle of the rude imperious surgeand in the visitation of the windswho take the ruffian billows by the topcurling their monstrous heads and hanging themwith deafning clamour in the slippery cloudsthat with the hurly death itself awakescanst thou O partial sleep give thy reposeto the wet sea-boy in an hour so rudeand in the calmest and most stillest nightwith all appliances and means to bootdeny it to a king then happy low lie downuneasy lies the head that wears a crownmany good morrows to your majestyis it good morrow lordsitis one oclock and pastwhy then good morrow to you all my lordshave you read oer the letters that I sent youwe have my liegethen you perceive the body of our kingdomhow foul it is what rank diseases growand with what danger near the heart of itit is but as a body yet distemperedwhich to his former strength may be restoredwith good advice and little medinemy lord northumberland will soon be cooledO God that one might read the book of fateand see the revolution of the timesmake mountains level and the continentweary of solid firmness melt itselfinto the sea and other times to seethe beachy girdle of the oceantoo wide for Neptunes hips how chances mockand changes fill the cup of alterationwith divers liquors O if this were seenthe happiest youth viewing his progress throughwhat perils past what crosses to ensuewould shut the book and sit him down and dieitis not ten years gonesince Richard and northumberland great friendsdid feast together and in two years afterwere they at wars it is but eight years sincethis Percy was the man nearest my soulwho like a brother toiled in my affairsand laid his love and life under my footyea for my sake even to the eyes of Richardgave him defiance but which of you was byyou cousin Nevil as I may rememberwhen Richard with his eye brimful of tearsthen checked and rated by northumberlanddid speak these words now proved a prophecynorthumberland thou ladder by the whichmy cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne though then God knows I had no such intentbut that necessity so bowed the statethat I and greatness were compelled to kissthe time shall come thus did he follow itthe time will come that foul sin gathering headshall break into corruption so went onforetelling this same times conditionand the division of our amitythere is a history in all mens livesfiguring the nature of the times deceasedthe which observed a man may prophesywith a near aim of the main chance of thingsas yet not come to life which in their seedsand weak leginnings lie intreasuredsuch things become the hatch and brood of timeand by the necessary form of thisking Richard might create a perfect guessthat great northumberland then false to himwould of that seed grow to a greater falsenesswhich should not find a ground to root uponunless on youare these things then necessitiesthen let us meet them like necessitiesand that same word even now cries out on usthey say the bishop and northumberlandare fifty thousand strongit cannot be my lordrumour doth double like the voice and echothe numbers of the feared please it your graceto go to bed upon my soul my lordthe powers that you already have sent forthshall bring this prize in very easilyto comfort

I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turks tribute I do remember him at Clements Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring when a was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife a was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invinble a was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the over-scutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fanes or his good-nights and now is this Vices dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and iull be sworn a never saw him but once in the Tilt-yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals men I saw it and told John a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well I will be acquainted with him if I return and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosophers two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him let time shape and there an endwhat is this forest calleditis gaultree forest ant shall please your gracehere stand my lords and send discovers forthto know the numbers of our enemieswe have sent forth alreadyitis well donemy friends and brethren in these great affairsI must acquaint you that I have receivednew-dated letters from northumberlandtheir cold intent tenour and substance thushere doth he wish his person with such powersas might hold sortance with his qualitythe which he could not levy whereuponhe is retired to ripe his growing fortunesto Scotland and concludes in hearty prayersthat your attempts may overlive the hazardand fearful meeting of their oppositethus do the hopes we have in him touch groundand dash themselves to piecesnow what newswest of this forest scarcely off a milein goodly form comes on the enemyand by the ground they hide I judge their numberupon or near the rate of thirty thousandthe just proportion that we gave them outlet us sway on and face them in the fieldwhat well-appointed leader fronts us hereI think it is my lord of Westmorelandhealth and fair greeting from our generalthe prince lord John and duke of Lancastersay on my lord of Westmoreland in peacewhat doth concern your comingthen my lordunto your grace do I in chief addressthe substance of my speech if that rebellioncame like itself in base and abject routsled on by bloody youth guarded with ragsand countenanced by boys and beggaryI say if damned commotion so appearedin his true native and most proper shapeyou reverend father and these noble lordshad not been here to dress the ugly formof base and bloody insurrectionwith your fair honours you lord archbishopwhose see is by a civil peace maintainedwhose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchedwhose learning and good letters peace hath tutoredwhose white investments figure innocencethe dove and very blessed spirit of peacewherefore do you so ill translate yourselfout of the speech of peace that bears such graceinto the harsh and boisterous tongue of warturning your books to greaves your ink to bloodyour pens to lances and your tongue divineto a loud trumpet and a point of warwherefore do I this so the question standsbriefly to this end we are all diseasedand with our surfeiting and wanton hourshave brought ourselves into a burning feverand we must bleed for it of which diseaseour late king Richard being infected diedbut my most noble lord of WestmorelandI take not on me here as a physiannor do I as an enemy to peacetroop in the throngs of military menbut rather show a while like fearful warto diet rank minds sick of happinessand purge the obstructions which begin to stopour very veins of life Hear me more plainlyI have in equal balance justly weighedwhat wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we sufferand find our griefs heavier than our offenceswe see which way the stream of time doth runand are enforced from our most quiet sphereby the rough torrent of occasionand have the summary of all our griefswhen time shall serve to show in articleswhich long ere this we offered to the kingand might by no suit gain our audiencewhen we are wronged and would unfold our griefswe are denied access unto his personeven by those men that most have done us wrongthe dangers of the days but newly gonewhose memory is written on the earthwith yet appearing blood and the examplesof every minutes instance present nowhave put us in these ill-beseeming armsnot to break peace or any branch of itbut to establish here a peace indeedconcurring both in name and qualitywhen ever yet was your appeal deniedwherein have you been galled by the kingwhat peer hath been suborned to grate on youthat you should seal this lawless bloody bookof forged rebellion with a seal divineand consecrate commotions bitter edgemy brother general the commonwealthto brother born an household crueltyI make my quarrel in particularthere is no need of any such redressor if there were it not belongs to youwhy not to him in part and to us allthat feel the bruises of the days beforeand suffer the condition of these timesto lay a heavy and unequal handupon our honoursO my good lord Mowbrayconstrue the times to their necessitiesand you shall say indeed it is the timeand not the king that doth you injuriesyet for your part it not appears to meeither from the king or in the present timethat you should have an inch of any groundto build a grief on were you not restoredto all the duke of norfolks signoriesyour noble and right well-remembered fatherswhat thing in honour had my father lostthat need to be revived and breathed in methe king that loved him as the state stood thenwas force perforce compelled to banish himand then that Harry Bolingbroke and hebeing mounted and both roused in their seatstheir neighing coursers daring of the spurtheir armed staves in charge their beavers downtheir eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steeland the loud trumpet blowing them togetherthen then when there was nothing could have stayedmy father from the breast of BolingbrokeO when the king did throw his warder downhis own life hung upon the staff he threwthen threw he down himself and all their livesthat by indictment and by dint of swordhave since miscarried under Bolingbrokeyou speak lord Mowbray now you know not whatthe earl of Hereford was reputed thenin England the most valiant gentlemanwho knows on whom fortune would then have smiledbut if your father had been victor therehe neer had borne it out of Coventryfor all the country in a general voicecried hate upon him and all their prayers and lovewere set on Hereford whom they doted onand blessed and graced indeed more than the kingbut this is mere digression from my purposehere come I from our princely generalto know your griefs to tell you from his gracethat he will give you audience and whereinit shall appear that your demands are justyou shall enjoy them every thing set offthat might so much as think you enemiesbut he hath forced us to compel this offerand it proceeds from policy not lovemowbray you overween to take it sothis offer comes from mercy not from fearfor lo within a ken our army liesupon mine honour all too confidentto give admittance to a thought of fearour battle is more full of names than yoursour men more perfect in the use of armsour armour all as strong our cause the bestthen reason will our hearts should be as goodsay you not then our offer is compelledwell by my will we shall admit no parleythat argues but the shame of your offencea rotten case abides no handlinghath the prince John a full commissionin very ample virtue of his fatherto hear and absolutely to determineof what conditions we shall stand uponthat is intended in the generals nameI muse you make so slight a questionthen take my lord of Westmoreland this schedulefor this contains our general grievanceseach several article herein redressedall members of our cause both here and hencethat are insinewed to this actionacquitted by a true substantial formand present execution of our willsto us and to our purposes consignedwe come within our awful banks againand knit our powers to the arm of peacethis will I show the general please you lordsin sight of both our battles we may meetand either end in peace which God so frameor to the place of difference call the swordswhich must dede itmy lord we will do sothere is a thing within my bosom tells methat no conditions of our peace can standfear you not that if we can make our peaceupon such large terms and so absoluteas our condition shall consist uponour peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountainsyea but our valuation shall be suchthat every slight and false-derived causeyea every idle nice and wanton reasonshall to the king taste of this actionthat were our royal faiths martyrs in lovewe shall be winnowed with so rough a windthat even our corn shall seem as light as chaffand good from bad find no partitionno no my lord note this the king is wearyof dainty and such picking grievancesfor he hath found to end one doubt by deathrevives two greater in the heirs of lifeand therefore will he wipe his tables cleanand keep no tell-tale to his memorythat may repeat and history his lossto new remembrance for full well he knowshe cannot so presely weed this landas his misdoubts present occasionhis foes are so enrooted with his friendsthat plucking to unfix an enemyhe doth unfasten so and shake a friendso that this land like an offensive wifethat hath enraged him on to offer strokesas he is striking holds his infant upand hangs resolved correction in the armthat was upreared to executionbesides the king hath wasted all his rodson late offenders that he now doth lackthe very instruments of chastisementso that his power like to a fangless lionmay offer but not holditis very trueand therefore be assured my good lord marshalif we do now make our atonement wellour peace will like a broken limb unitedgrow stronger for the breakingbe it sohere is returned my lord of Westmorelandthe prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordshipto meet his grace just distance btween our armiesyour grace of York in Gods name then set forwardbefore and greet his grace my lord we comeyou are well encountered here my cousin Mowbraygood day to you gentle lord archbishopand so to you lord hastings and to allmy lord of York it better showed with youwhen that your flock assembled by the bellenrcled you to hear with reverenceyour exposition on the holy textthan now to see you here an iron mancheering a rout of rebels with your drumturning the word to sword and life to deaththat man that sits within a monarchs heartand ripens in the sunshine of his favourwould he abuse the countenance of the kingalack what mischief might he set abroachin shadow of such greatness With you lord bishopit is even so who hath not heard it spokenhow deep you were within the books of Godto us the speaker in his parliamentto us the imagined voice of God himselfthe very opener and intelligencerbetween the grace the sanctities of heavenand our dull workings O who shall believebut you misuse the reverence of your placeemploy the countenance and grace of heavenas a false favourite doth his princes namein deeds dishonourable you have taken upunder the counterfeited zeal of Godthe subjects of his substitute my fatherand both against the peace of heaven and himhave here upswarmed themgood my lord of LancasterI am not here against your fathers peacebut as I told my lord of Westmorelandthe time misordered doth in common sensecrowd us and crush us to this monstrous formto hold our safety up I sent your gracethe parcels and particulars of our griefthe which hath been with scorn shoved from the courtwhereon this Hydra son of war is bornwhose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleepwith grant of our most just and right desiresand true obedience of this madness curedstoop tamely to the foot of majestyif not we ready are to try our fortunesto the last manand though we here fall downwe have supplies to second our attemptif they miscarry theirs shall second themand so success of mischief shall be bornand heir from heir shall hold this quarrel upwhiles England shall have generationyou are too shallow hastings much too shallowto sound the bottom of the after-timespleaseth your grace to answer them directlyhow far forth you do like their articlesI like them all and do allow them welland swear here by the honour of my bloodmy fathers purposes have been mistookand some about him have too lavishlywrested his meaning and authoritymy lord these griefs shall be with speed redressedupon my soul they shall if this may please youdischarge your powers unto their several countiesas we will ours and here between the armieslets drink together friendly and embracethat all their eyes may bear those tokens homeof our restored love and amityI take your princely word for these redressesI give it you and will maintain my wordand thereupon I drink unto your gracego captain and deliver to the armythis news of peace let them have pay and partI know it will well please them chide thee captainto you my noble lord of WestmorelandI pledge your grace and if you knew what painsI have bestowed to breed this present peaceyou would drink freely but my love to youshall show itself more openly hereafterI do not doubt youI am glad of ithealth to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbrayyou wish me health in very happy seasonfor I am on the sudden something illagainst ill chances men are ever merrybut heaviness foreruns the good eventtherefore be merry coz since sudden sorrowserves to say thus Some good thing comes to morrowbelieve me I am passing light in spiritso much the worse if your own rule be truethe word of peace is rendered hark how they shoutthis had been cheerful after victorya peace is of the nature of a conquestfor then both parties nobly are subduedand neither party losergo my lordand let our army be discharged tooand good my lord so please you let our trainsmarch by us that we may peruse the menwe should have coped withalgo good lord hastingsand ere they be dismissed let them march byI trust lords we shall lie to-night togethernow cousin wherefore stands our army stillthe leaders having charge from you to standwill not go off until they hear you speakthey know their dutiesmy lord our army is dispersed alreadylike youthful steers unyoked they take their courseseast west north south or like a school broke upeach hurries toward his home and sporting-placegood tidings my lord hastings for the whichI do arrest thee traitor of high treasonand you lord archbishop and you lord Mowbrayof capital treason I attach you bothis this proceeding just and honourableis your assembly sowill you thus break your faithI pawned thee noneI promised you redress of these same grievanceswhereof you did complain which by mine honourI will perform with a most christian carebut for you rebels look to taste the duemeet for rebellion and such acts as yoursmost shallowly did you these arms commencefondly brought here and foolishly sent hencestrike up our drums pursue the scattered straygod and not we hath safely fought to-daysome guard these traitors to the block of deathtreasons true bed and yielder up of breathwhats your name sir of what condition are you and of what place I prayI am a knight sir and my name is Colevile of the dalewell then Colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale Colevile shall still be your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still Colevile of the daleare not you sir John Falstaffas good a man as he sir whoeer I am do ye yield sir or shall I sweat for you if I do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercyI think you are sir John Falstaff and in that thought yield meI have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name An I had but a belly of any indifferency I were simply the most active fellow in Europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our generalthe heat is past follow no further nowcall in the powers good cousin Westmorelandnow Falstaff where have you been all this whilewhen everything is ended then you comethese tardy tricks of yours will on my lifeone time or other break some gallows backI would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility I have foundered nine score and odd posts and here travel-tainted as I am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken sir John Colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that I may justly say with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome I came saw and overcame it was more of his courtesy than your deservingI know not here he is and here I yield him and I beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this days deeds or by the lord I will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top onit Colevile kissing my foot to the which course if I be enforced if you do not all show like gilt two-pences to me and I in the clear sky of fame oershine you as much as the full moon doth the nders of the element which show like pins heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mountthines too heavy to mountlet it shine thenthines too thick to shinelet it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you willis thy name Colevileit is my lorda famous rebel art thou Colevileand a famous true subject took himI am my lord but as my betters arethat led me hither had they been ruled by meyou should have won them dearer than you haveI know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and I thank thee for theehave you left pursuitretreat is made and execution stayedsend Colevile with his confederatesto York to present executionblunt lead him hence and see you guard him sureand now dispatch we toward the court my lordsI hear the king my father is sore sickour news shall go before us to his majestywhich cousinyou shall bear to comfort himand we with sober speed will follow youmy lord I beseech you give me leave to gothrough Gloucestershire and when you come to courtstand my good lord pray in your good reportfare you well Falstaff I in my conditionshall better speak of you than you deserveI would you had but the wit itwere better than your dukedom Good faith this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but thats no marvel he drinks no wine theres never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood and making many fish-meals that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered oer to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a-work and leaining a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if I had a thousand sons the first human prinple I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sackhow now Bardolphthe army is discharged all and gonelet them go iull through Gloucestershire and there will I visit master Robert Shallow esquire I have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb and shortly will I seal with him come awaynow lords if God doth give successful endto this debate that bleedeth at our doorswe will our youth lead on to higher fieldsand draw no swords but what are sanctifiedour navy is addressed our power collectedour substitutes in absence well investedand everything lies level to our wishonly we want a little personal strengthand pause us till these rebels now afootcome underneath the yoke of governmentboth which we doubt not but your majestyshall soon enjoyhumphrey my son of Gloucesterwhere is the prince your brotherI think hes gone to hunt my lord at windsorand how accompaniedI do not know my lordis not his brother Thomas of Clarence with himno my good lord he is in presence herewhat would my lord and fathernothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarencehow chance thou art not with the prince thy brotherhe loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomasthou hast a better place in his affectionthan all thy brothers cherish it my boyand noble offices thou mayst effectof mediation after I am deadbetween his greatness and thy other brethrentherefore omit him not blunt not his lovenor lose the good advantage of his graceby seeming cold or careless of his willfor he is gracious if he be observedhe hath a tear for pity and a handopen as day for melting charityyet notwithstanding being incensed hes flintas humorous as winter and as suddenas flaws congealed in the spring of dayhis temper therefore must be well observedchide him for faults and do it reverentlywhen you perceive his blood inclined to mirthbut being moody give him line and scopetill that his passions like a whale on groundconfound themselves with working Learn this Thomasand thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friendsa hoop of gold to bind thy brothers inthat the united vessel of their bloodmingled with venom of suggestionas force perforce the age will pour it inshall never leak though it do work as strongas aconitum or rash gunpowderI shall observe him with all care and lovewhy art thou not at windsor with him Thomashe is not there to-day he dines in Londonand how accompanied canst thou tell thatwith Poins and other his continual followersmost subject is the fattest soil to weedsand he the noble image of my youthis overspread with them therefore my griefstretches itself beyond the hour of deaththe blood weeps from my heart when I do shapein forms imaginary the unguided daysand rotten times that you shall look uponwhen I am sleeping with my ancestorsfor when his headstrong riot hath no curbwhen rage and hot blood are his counsellorswhen means and lavish manners meet togetherO with what wings shall his affections flytowards fronting peril and opposed decaymy gracious lord you look beyond him quitethe prince but studies his companionslike a strange tongue wherein to gain the languageitis needful that the most immodest wordbe looked upon and learned which once attainedyour highness knows comes to no further usebut to be known and hated so like gross termsthe prince will in the perfectness of timecast off his followers and their memoryshall as a pattern or a measure liveby which his grace must mete the lives of othersturning past evils to advantagesitis seldom when the bee doth leave her combin the dead carrionwhos here Westmorelandhealth to my sovereign and new happinessadded to that that I am to deliverprince John your son doth kiss your graces handmowbray the Bishop Scroop hastings and allare brought to the correction of your lawthere is not now a rebels sword unsheathedbut peace puts forth her olive everywherethe manner how this action hath been bornehere at more leisure may your highness readwith every course in his particularO Westmoreland thou art a summer birdwhich ever in the haunch of winter singsthe lifting up of daylook heres more newsfrom enemies heaven keep your majestyand when they stand against you may they fallas those that I am come to tell you ofthe earl northumberland and the lord Bardolphwith a great power of English and of Scotsare by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrownthe manner and true order of the fightthis packet please it you contains at largeand wherefore should these good news make me sickwill fortune never come with both hands fullbut write her fair words still in foulest lettersshe either gives a stomach and no foodsuch are the poor in health or else a feastand takes away the stomach such are the richthat have abundance and enjoy it notI should rejoice now at this happy newsand now my sight fails and my brain is giddyO me come near me now I am much illcomfort your majestyO my royal fathermy sovereign lord cheer up yourself look upbe patient princes you do know these fitsare with his highness very ordinarystand from him give him air hell straight be wellno no he cannot long hold out these pangsthe incessant care and labour of his mindhath wrought the mure that should confine it inso thin that life looks through and will break outthe people fear me for they do observeunfathered heirs and loathly births of naturethe seasons change their manners as the yearhad found some months asleep and leaped them overthe river hath thrice flowed no ebb betweenand the old folk times doting chroniclessay it did so a little time beforethat our great-grandsire Edward sicked and diedspeak lower princes for the king recoversthis apoplexy will certain be his endI pray you take me up and bear me henceinto some other chamber softly praylet there be no noise made my gentle friendsunless some dull and favourable handwill whisper music to my weary spiritcall for the music in the other roomset me the crown upon my pillow herehis eye is hollow and he changes muchless noise less noisewho saw the duke of ClarenceI am here brother full of heavinesshow now rain within doors and none abroadhow doth the kingexceeding illheard he the good news yettell it himhe altered much upon the hearing itif he be sick with joy he will recover without physicnot so much noise my lords sweet prince speak lowthe king your father is disposed to sleeplet us withdraw into the other roomwillit please your grace to go along with usno I will sit and watch here by the kingwhy doth the crown lie there upon his pillowbeing so troublesome a bedfellowO polished perturbation golden carethat keepest the ports of slumber open wideto many a watchful night Sleep with it nowyet not so sound and half so deeply sweetas he whose brow with homely biggin boundsnores out the watch of night O majestywhen thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sitlike a rich armour worn in heat of daythat scalds with safety by his gates of breaththere lies a downy feather which stirs notdid he suspire that light and weightless downperforce must move my gracious lord my fatherthis sleep is sound indeed this is a sleepthat from this golden rigol hath divorcedso many English kings thy due from meis tears and heavy sorrows of the bloodwhich nature love and filial tendernessshall O dear father pay thee plenteouslymy due from thee is this imperial crownwhich as immediate from thy place and bloodderives itself to me Lo here it sitswhich heaven shall guard and put the worlds whole strengthinto one giant arm it shall not forcethis lineal honour from me this from theewill I to mine leave as itis left to mewarwick Gloucester Clarencedoth the king callwhat would your majesty how fares your gracewhy did you leave me here alone my lordswe left the prince my brother here my liegewho undertook to sit and watch by youthe prince of Wales where is he let me see himhe is not herethis door is open he is gone this wayhe came not through the chamber where we stayedwhere is the crown who took it from my pillowwhen we withdrew my liege we left it herethe prince hath taen it hence go seek him outis he so hasty that he doth supposemy sleep my deathfind him my lord of Warwick chide him hitherthis part of his conjoins with my diseaseand helps to end me See sons what things you arehow quickly nature falls into revoltwhen gold becomes her objectfor this the foolish over-careful fathershave broke their sleeps with thoughtstheir brains with care their bones with industryfor this they have engrossed and piled upthe cankered heaps of strange-achieved goldfor this they have been thoughtful to investtheir sons with arts and martial exerseswhen like the bee culling from every flowerthe virtuous sweetsour thighs packed with wax our mouths with honeywe bring it to the hive and like the beesare murdered for our pains this bitter tasteyield his engrossments to the ending fathernow where is he that will not stay so longtill his friend sickness hath determined memy lord I found the prince in the next roomwashing with kindly tears his gentle cheekswith such a deep demeanour in great sorrowthat tyranny which never quaffed but bloodwould by beholding him have washed his knifewith gentle eye-drops he is coming hitherbut wherefore did he take away the crownlo where he comes come hither to me Harrydepart the chamber leave us here aloneI never thought to hear you speak againthy wish was father Harry to that thoughtI stay too long by thee I weary theedost thou so hunger for my empty chairthat thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honoursbefore thy hour be ripe O foolish youththou seekest the greatness that will overwhelm theestay but a little for my cloud of dignityis held from falling with so weak a windthat it will quickly drop my day is dimthou hast stoln that which after some few hourswere thine without offence and at my deaththou hast sealed up my expectationthy life did manifest thou lovedst me notand thou wilt have me die assured of itthou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughtswhich thou hast whetted on thy stony heartto stab at half an hour of my lifewhat canst thou not forbear me half an hourthen get thee gone and dig my grave thyselfand bid the merry bells ring to thine earthat thou art crowned not that I am deadlet all the tears that should bedew my hearsebe drops of balm to sanctify thy headonly compound me with forgotten dustgive that which gave thee life unto the wormspluck down my officers break my decreesfor now a time is come to mock at formharry the fifth is crowned up vanitydown royal state all you sage counsellors henceand to the English court assemble nowfrom every region apes of idlenessnow neighbour confines purge you of your scumhave you a ruffian that will swear drink dancerevel the night rob murder and committhe oldest sins the newest kind of waysbe happy he will trouble you no moreengland shall double gild his treble guiltengland shall give him office honour mightfor the fifth Harry from curbed licence plucksthe muzzle of restraint and the wild dogshall flesh his tooth in every innocentO my poor kingdom sick with vile blowswhen that my care could not withhold thy riotswhat wilt thou do when riot is thy careO thou wilt be a wilderness againpeopled with wolves thy old inhabitantsO pardon me my liege but for my tearsthe moist impediments unto my speechI had forestalled this dear and deep rebukeere you with grief had spoke and I had heardthe course of it so far there is your crownand he that wears the crown immortallylong guard it yours if I affect it morethan as your honour and as your renownlet me no more from this obedience risewhich my most true and inward duteous spiritteacheth this prostrate and exterior bendinggod witness with me when I here came inand found no course of breath within your majestyhow cold it struck my heart if I do feignO let me in my present wildness dieand never live to show the incredulous worldthe noble change that I have purposedcoming to look on you thinking you deadand dead almost my liege to think you wereI spake unto the crown as having senseand thus upbraided it the care on thee dependinghath fed upon the body of my fathertherefore thou best of gold art worst of goldother less fine in carat is more preciouspreserving life in medine potablebut thou most fine most honoured most renownedhast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liegeaccusing it I put it on my headto try with it as with an enemythat had before my face murdered my fatherthe quarrel of a true inheritorbut if it did infect my blood with joyor swell my thoughts to any strain of prideif any rebel or vain spirit of minedid with the least affection of a welcomegive entertainment to the might of itlet God for ever keep it from my headand make me as the poorest vassal isthat doth with awe and terror kneel to itO my songod put it in thy mind to take it hencethat thou mightst win the more thy fathers lovepleading so wisely in excuse of itcome hither Harry sit thou by my bedand hear I think the very latest counselthat ever I shall breathe God knows my sonby what by-paths and indirect crooked waysI met this crown and I myself know wellhow troublesome it sat upon my headto thee it shall descend with better quietbetter opinion better confirmationfor all the soil of the achievement goeswith me into the earth it seemed in mebut as an honour snatched with boisterous handand I had many living to upbraidmy gain of it by their assistanceswhich daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshedwounding supposed peace All these bold fearsthou seest with peril I have answeredfor all my reign hath been but as a sceneacting that argument and now my deathchanges the mode for what in me was purchasedfalls upon thee in a more fairer sortso thou the garment wearest successivelyyet though thou standest more sure than I could dothou art not firm enough since griefs are greenand all my friends which thou must make thy friendshave but their stings and teeth newly taen outby whose fell working I was first advancedand by whose power I well might lodge a fearto be again displaced which to avoidI cut them off and had a purpose nowto lead out many to the Holy Landlest rest and lying still might make them looktoo near unto my state therefore my Harrybe it thy course to busy giddy mindswith foreign quarrels that action hence borne outmay waste the memory of the former daysmore would I but my lungs are wasted sothat strength of speech is utterly denied mehow I came by the crown O God forgiveand grant it may with thee in true peace livemy gracious liegeyou won it wore it kept it gave it methen plain and right must my possession bewhich I with more than with a common paingainst all the world will rightfully maintainlook look here comes my John of Lancasterhealth peace and happiness to my royal fatherthou bringest me happiness and peace son Johnbut health alack with youthful wings is flownfrom this bare withered trunk upon thy sightmy worldly business makes a periodwhere is my lord of Warwickmy lord of Warwickdoth any name particular belongunto the lodging where I first did swounditis called Jerusalem my noble lordlaud be to God even there my life must endit hath been prophesied to me many yearsI should not die but in Jerusalemwhich vainly I supposed the Holy Landbut bear me to that chamber there iull liein that Jerusalem shall Harry dieby cock and pie sir you shall not away to-night what Davy I sayyou must excuse me master Robert ShallowI will not excuse you you shall not be excused excuses shall not be admitted there is no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused why Davyhere sirdavy Davy Davy Davy let me see Davy let me see yea marry William cook bid him come hither sir John you shall not be excusedmarry sir thus those precepts cannot be served and again sir shall we sow the headland with wheatwith red wheat Davy but for William cook are there no young pigeonsyes sir here is now the smiths note for shoeing and plough-ironslet it be cast and paid sir John you shall not be excusednow sir a new link to the bucket must needs be had and sir do you mean to stop any of Williams wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley faira shall answer it Some pigeons Davy a couple of short-legged hens a joint of mutton and any pretty little tiny kickshaws tell William cookdoth the man of war stay all night siryea Davy I will use him well a friend inthe court is better than a penny in purse use his men well Davy for they are arrant knaves and will backbiteno worse than they are back-bitten sir for they have marvellous foul linenwell conceited Davy about thy business DavyI beseech you sir to countenance William Visor of wincot against Clement Perkes of the hillthere are many complaints Davy against that Visor that Visor is an arrant knave on my knowledgeI grant your worship that he is a knave sir but yet God forbid sir but a knave should have some countenance at his friends request An honest man sir is able to speak for himself when a knave is not I have served your worship truly sir this eight years and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man I have but a very little credit with your worship the knave is mine honest friend sir therefore I beseech your worship let him be countenancedgo to I say he shall have no wrong look about Davywhere are you sir John come come come off with your boots give me your hand master BardolphI am glad to see your worshipI thank thee with all my heart kind master Bardolphand welcome my tall fellow come sir Johniull follow you good master Robert Shallowif I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master Shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his mens spirits and his they by observing him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice-like serving-man Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the partipation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild-geese if I had a suit to master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men I would curry with master Shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and a shall laugh without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid upsir JohnI come master Shallow I come master Shallowhow now my lord Chief Justice whither awayhow doth the kingexceeding well his cares are now all endedI hope not deadhes walked the way of natureand to our purposes he lives no moreI would his majesty had called me with himthe service that I truly did his lifehath left me open to all injuriesindeed I think the young king loves you notI know he doth not and do arm myselfto welcome the condition of the timewhich cannot look more hideously upon methan I have drawn it in my fantasyhere come the heavy issue of dead HarryO that the living Harry had the temperof him the worst of these three gentlemenhow many nobles then should hold their placesthat must strike sail to spirits of vile sortO God I fear all will be overturnedgood morrow cousin Warwick good morrowgood morrow cousingood morrow cousinwe meet like men that had forgot to speakwe do remember but our argumentis all too heavy to admit much talkwell peace be with him that hath made us heavypeace be with us lest we be heavierO good my lord you have lost a friend indeedand I dare swear you borrow not that faceof seeming sorrow it is sure your ownthough no man be assured what grace to findyou stand in coldest expectationI am the sorrier would itwere otherwisewell you must now speak sir John Falstaff fairwhich swims against your stream of qualitysweet princes what I did I did in honourled by the impartial conduct of my souland never shall you see that I will bega ragged and forestalled remissionif truth and upright innocency fail meiull to the king my master that is deadand tell him who hath sent me after himhere comes the princegood morrow and God save your majestythis new and gorgeous garment majestysits not so easy on me as you thinkbrothers you mix your sadness with some fearthis is the English not the Turkish courtnot Amurath an Amurath succeedsbut Harry Harry yet be sad good brothersfor to speak truth it very well becomes yousorrow so royally in you appearsthat I will deeply put the fashion onand wear it in my heart why then be sadbut entertain no more of it good brothersthan a joint burden laid upon us allfor me by heaven I bid you be assurediull be your father and your brother toolet me but bear your love iull bear your caresyet weep that Harrys dead and so will Ibut Harry lives that shall convert those tearsby number into hours of happinesswe hope no other from your majestyyou all look strangely on meand you mostyou are I think assured I love you notI am assured if I be measured rightlyyour majesty hath no just cause to hate menohow might a prince of my great hopes forgetso great indignities you laid upon mewhat rate rebuke and roughly send to prisonthe immediate heir of England was this easymay this be washed in lethe and forgottenI then did use the person of your fatherthe image of his power lay then in meand in the administration of his lawwhiles I was busy for the commonwealthyour highness pleased to forget my placethe majesty and power of law and justicethe image of the king whom I presentedand struck me in my very seat of judgmentwhereon as an offender to your fatherI gave bold way to my authorityand did commit you if the deed were illbe you contented wearing now the garlandto have a son set your decrees at noughtto pluck down justice from your awful benchto trip the course of law and blunt the swordthat guards the peace and safety of your personnay more to spurn at your most royal imageand mock your workings in a second bodyquestion your royal thoughts make the case yoursbe now the father and propose a sonhear your own dignity so much profanedsee your most dreadful laws so loosely slightedbehold yourself so by a son disdainedand then imagine me taking your partand in your power soft silenng your sonafter this cold considerance sentence meand as you are a king speak in your statewhat I have done that misbecame my placemy person or my lieges sovreigntyyou are right justice and you weigh this welltherefore still bear the balance and the swordand I do wish your honours may increasetill you do live to see a son of mineoffend you and obey you as I didso shall I live to speak my fathers wordshappy am I that have a man so boldthat dares do justice on my proper sonand not less happy having such a sonthat would deliver up his greatness sointo the hands of justice you did commit mefor which I do commit into your handthe unstained sword that you have used to bearwith this remembrance that you use the samewith the like bold just and impartial spiritas you have done gainst me there is my handyou shall be as a father to my youthmy voice shall sound as you do prompt mine earand I will stoop and humble my intentsto your well-practised wise directionsand princes all believe me I beseech youmy father is gone wild into his gravefor in his tomb lie my affectionsand with his spirit sadly I surviveto mock the expectation of the worldto frustrate prophees and to raze outrotten opinion who hath writ me downafter my seeming the tide of blood in mehath proudly flowed in vanity till nownow doth it turn and ebb back to the seawhere it shall mingle with the state of floodsand flow henceforth in formal majestynow call we our high court of parliamentand let us choose such limbs of noble counselthat the great body of our state may goin equal rank with the best governed nationthat war or peace or both at once may beas things acquainted and familiar to usin which you father shall have foremost handour coronation done we will acteas I before remembered all our stateand God consigning to my good intentsno prince nor

of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt prove mine own marring but to the purpose and so to the venture be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better I did mean indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle creditors lose here I promised you I would be and here I commit my body to your meres bate me some and I will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitelyif my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs and yet that were but light payment to dance out of your debt but a good consence will make any possible satisfaction and so will I All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assemblyone word more I beseech you if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will continue the story with sir John in it and make you merry with fair Katharine of France where for anything I know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already a be killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man my tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid you good night and so kneel down before you but indeed to pray for the queenas by your high imperial majestyI had in charge at my depart for Franceas procurator to your excellenceto marry princess Margaret for your graceso in the famous anent ty Toursin presence of the kings of France and Silthe dukes of Orleans Calaber Britaine and Alen onseven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishopsI have performed my task and was espousedand humbly now upon my bended kneein sight of England and her lordly peersdeliver up my title in the queento your most gracious hands that are the substanceof that great shadow I did representthe happiest gift that ever marquess gavethe fairest queen that ever king receivedsuffolk arise welcome queen MargaretI can express no kinder sign of lovethan this kind kiss O lord that lends me lifelend me a heart replete with thankfulnessfor thou hast given me in this beauteous facea world of earthly blessings to my soulif sympathy of love unite our thoughtsgreat king of England and my gracious lordthe mutual conference that my mind hath hadby day by night waking and in my dreamsin courtly company or at my beadswith you mine alderliefest sovereignmakes me the bolder to salute my kingwith ruder terms such as my wit affordsand over-joy of heart doth ministerher sight did ravish but her grace in speechher words y-clad with wisdoms majestymakes me from wondering fall to weeping joyssuch is the fulness of my hearts contentlords with one cheerful voice welcome my lovelong live queen Margaret Englands happinesswe thank you allmy lord Protector so it please your gracehere are the articles of contracted peacebetween our sovereign and the French king Charlesfor eighteen months concluded by consentimprimis it is agreed between the French king Charles and William De la Pole Marquess of Suffolk ambassador for Henry king of England that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret daughter unto Reignier king of Naples Silia and Jerusalem and crown her queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuingitem that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her fatheruncle how nowpardon me gracious lordsome sudden qualm hath struck me at the heartand dimmed mine eyes that I can read no furtheruncle of winchester I pray read onitem it is further agreed between them that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father and she sent over of the king of Englands own proper cost and charges without having any dowrythey please us well lord marquess kneel downwe here create thee the first duke of Suffolkand girt thee with the sword Cousin of Yorkwe here discharge your grace from being regentinthe parts of France till term of eighteen monthsbe full expired thanks uncle winchestergloucester York Buckingham Somersetsalisbury and Warwickwe thank you all for this great favour donein entertainment to my princely queencome let us in and with all speed provideto see her coronation be performedbrave peers of England pillars of the stateto you duke Humphrey must unload his griefyour grief the common grief of all the landwhat did my brother Henry spend his youthhis valour coin and people in the warsdid he so often lodge in open fieldin winters cold and summers parching heatto conquer France his true inheritanceand did my brother Bedford toil his witsto keep by policy what Henry gothave you yourselves Somerset Buckinghambrave York Salisbury and victorious Warwickreceived deep scars in France and normandyor hath mine uncle Beaufort and myselfwith all the learned counselof the realmstudied so long sat in the counl-houseearly and late debating to and frohow France and Frenchmen might be kept in aweand hath his highness in his infancybeen crowned in Paris in despite of foesand shall these labours and these honours dieshall Henrys conquest Bedfords vigilanceyour deeds of war and all our counsel dieO peers of England shameful is this leaguefatal this marriage cancelling your fameblotting your names from books of memoryrazing the characters of your renowndefang monuments of conquered Franceundoing all as all had never beennephew what means this passionate discoursethis peroration with such rcumstancefor France itis ours and we will keep it stillay uncle we will keep it if we canbut now it is impossible we shouldsuffolk the new-made duke that rules the roasthath given the duchies of Anjou and Maineunto the poor king Reignier whose large styleagrees not with the leanness of his pursenow by the death of him who died for allthese counties were the keys of normandybut wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant sonfor grief that they are past recoveryfor were there hope to conquer them againmy sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tearsanjou and Maine myself did win them boththose provinces these arms of mine did conquerand are the ties that I got with woundsdelivered up again with peaceful wordsmort Dieufor Suffolks duke may he be suffocatethat dims the honour of this war-like islefrance should have torn and rent my very heartbefore I would have yielded to this leagueI never read but Englands kings have hadlarge sums of gold and dowries with their wivesand our king Henry gives away his ownto match with her that brings no vantagesa proper jest and never heard beforethat Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenthfor costs and charges in transporting hershe should have stayed in France and starved in Francebeforemy lord of Gloucester now you grow too hotit was the pleasure of my lord the kingmy lord of winchester I know your minditis not my speeches that you do mislikebut itis my presence that doth trouble yerancour will out proud prelate in thy faceI see thy fury if I longer staywe shall begin our anent bickeringslordings farewell and say when I am goneI prophesied France will be lost ere longso there goes our protector in a rageitis known to you he is mine enemynay more an enemy unto you alland no great friend I fear me to the kingconsider lords he is the next of bloodand heir apparent to the English crownhad Henry got an empire by his marriageand all the wealthy kingdoms of the westtheres reason he should be displeased at itlook to it lords let not his smoothing wordsbewitch your hearts be wise and rcumspectwhat though the common people favour himcalling him Humphrey the good duke of Gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voicejesu maintain your royal excellence with God preserve the good duke Humphrey I fear me lords for all this flattering glosshe will be found a dangerous protectorwhy should he then protect our sovereignhe being of age to govern of himselfcousin of Somerset join you with meand all together with the duke of Suffolkwell quickly hoise duke Humphrey from his seatthis weighty business will not brook delayiull to the duke of Suffolk presentlycousin of Buckingham though Humphreys prideand greatness of his place be grief to usyet let us watch the haughty cardinalhis insolence is more intolerablethan all the princes in the land besideif Gloucester be displaced hell be protectoror thou or I Somerset will be protectordespite duke Humphrey or the cardinalpride went before ambition follows himwhile these do labour for their own prefermentbehoves it us to labour for the realmI never saw but Humphrey duke of Gloucesterdid bear him like a noble gentlemanoft have I seen the haughty cardinalmore like a soldier than a man ofthe churchas stout and proud as he were lord of allswear like a ruffian and demean himselfunlike the ruler of a commonwealwarwick my son the comfort of my agethy deeds thy plainness and thy house-keepinghave won the greatest favour of the commonsexcepting none but good duke Humphreyand brother York thy acts in Irelandin bringing them to civil displinethy late exploits done in the heart of Francewhen thou wert regent for our sovereignhave made thee feared and honoured of the peoplejoin we together for the public goodin what we can to bridle and suppressthe pride of Suffolk and the cardinalwith Somersets and Buckinghams ambitionand as we may cherish duke Humphreys deedswhile they do tend the profit of the landso God help Warwick as he loves the landand common profit of his countryand so says York for he hath greatest causethen lets make haste away and look unto the mainunto the main O father Maine is lostthat Maine which by main force Warwick did winand would have kept so long as breath did lastmain chance father you meant but I meant Mainewhich I will win from France or else be slainanjou and Maine are given to the Frenchparis is lost the state of normandystands on a tickle point now they are gonesuffolk concluded on the articlesthe peers agreed and Henry was well pleasedto change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughterI cannot blame them all what isit to themitis thine they give away and not their ownpirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillageand purchase friends and give to courtezansstill revelling like lords till all be gonewhile as the silly owner of the goodsweeps over them and wrings his hapless handsand shakes his head and trembling stands aloofwhile all is shared and all is borne awayready to starve and dare not touch his ownso York must sit and fret and bite his tonguewhile his own lands are bargained for and soldmethinks the realms of England France and Irelandbear that proportion to my flesh and bloodas did the fatal brand Alth a burnedunto the princes heart of Calydonanjou and Maine both given unto the Frenchcold news for me for I had hope of Franceeven as I have of fertile Englands soila day will come when York shall claim his ownand therefore I will take the Nevils partsand make a show of love to proud duke Humphreyand when I spy advantage claim the crownfor thats the golden mark I seek to hitnor shall proud Lancaster usurp my rightnor hold the sceptre in his childish fistnor wear the diadem upon his headwhose church-like humours fit not for a crownthen York be still awhile till time do servewatch thou and wake when others be asleepto pry into the secrets of the statetill Henry surfeiting in joys of lovewith his new bride and Englands dear-bought queenand Humphrey with the peers be falln at jarsthen will I raise aloft the milk-white rosewith whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumedand in my standard bear the arms of Yorkto grapple with the house of Lancasterand force perforce iull make him yield the crownwhose bookish rule hath pulled fair England downwhy droops my lord like over-ripened cornhanging the head at Ceres plenteous loadwhy doth the great duke Humphrey knit his browsas frowning at the favours of the worldwhy are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earthgazing on that which seems to dim thy sightwhat seest thou there king Henrys diademenchased with all the honours of the worldif so gaze on and grovel on thy faceuntil thy head be rcled with the sameput

dreammethought this staff mine office-badge in courtwas broke in twain by whom I have forgotbut as I think it was by the cardinaland on the pieces of the broken wandwere placed the heads of Edmund duke of Somersetand William De la Pole first duke of Suffolkthis was my dream what it doth bode God knowstut this was nothing but an argumentthat he that breaks a stick of Gloucesters groveshall lose his head for his presumptionbut list to me my Humphrey my sweet dukemethought I sat in seat of majestyin the cathedral church of Westminsterand in that chair where kings and queens are crownedwhere Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to meand on my head did set the diademnay Eleanor then must I chide outrightpresumptuous dame ill-nurtured Eleanorart thou not second woman in the realmand the protectors wife beloved of himhast thou not worldly pleasure at commandabove the reach or compass of thy thoughtand wilt thou still be hammering treacheryto tumble down thy husband and thyselffrom top of honour to disgraces feetaway from me and let me hear no morewhat what my lord are you so cholericwith Eleanor for telling but her dreamnext time iull keep my dreams

have I gold flies from another coastI dare not say from the rich cardinaland from the great and new-made duke of Suffolkyet I do find it so for to be plainthey knowing Dame Eleanors aspiring humourhave hired me to undermine the duchessand buzz these conjurations in her brainthey say a crafty knave does need no broker yet am I Suffolk and the cardinals brokerhume if you take not heed you shall go nearto call them both a pair of crafty knaveswell so it stands and thus I fear at lasthumes knavery will be the duchess wrackand her attainture will be Humphreys fallsort how it will

how now sir knavealas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our whole townshipagainst my master Thomas Horner for saying that the duke of York was rightful heir to the crownwhat sayst thou did the duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crownthat my master was no forsooth my master said that he was and that the king was an usurperwho is theretake this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently well hear more of your matter before the kingand as for you that love to be protectedunder the wings of our protectors gracebegin your suits anew and sue to himaway base cullions Suffolk let them gocome lets be gonemy lord of Suffolk say is this the guiseis this the fashion of the court of Englandis this the government of Britains isleand this the royalty of Albions kingwhat shall king Henry be a pupil stillunder the surly Gloucesters governanceam I a queen in title and in styleand must be made a subject to a dukeI tell thee Pole when in the ty Toursthou ranest a tilt in honour of my loveand stolest away the ladies hearts of FranceI thought king Henry had resembled theein courage courtship and proportionbut all his mind is bent to holinessto number Ave-maries on his beadshis champions are the prophets and apostleshis weapons holy saws of sacred writhis study is his tilt-yard and his lovesare brazen images of canonized saintsI would the college of the cardinalswould choose him pope and carry him to Romeand set the triple crown upon his headthat were a state fit for his holinessmadam be patient as I was causeyour highness came to England so will Iin England work your graces full contentbeside the haught protector have we Beaufortthe imperious churchman Somerset Buckinghamand grumbling York and not the least of thesebut can do more in England than the kingand he of these that can do most of allcannot do more in England than the Nevilssalisbury and Warwick are no simple peersnot all these lords do vex me half so muchas that proud dame the lord Protectors wifeshe sweeps it through the court with troops of ladiesmore like an empress than duke Humphreys wifestrangers in court do take her for the queenshe bears a dukes revenues on her backand in her heart she scorns our povertyshall I not live to be avenged on hercontemptuous base-born callot as she isshe vaunted mongst her minions tother daythe very train of her worst wearing gownwas better worth than all my fathers landstill Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughtermadam myself have limed a bush for herand placed a quire of such enting birdsthat she will light to listen to the laysand never mount to trouble you againso let her rest and madam list to mefor I am bold to counsel you in thisalthough we fancy not the cardinalyet must we join with him and with the lordstill we have brought duke Humphrey in disgraceas for the duke of York this late complaintwill make but little for his benefitso one by one well weed them all at lastand you yourself shall steer the happy helmfor my part noble lords I care not whichor Somerset or York alls one to meif York have ill demeaned himself in Francethen let him be denayed the regentshipif Somerset be unworthy of the placelet York be regent I will yield to himwhether your grace be worthy yea or nodispute not that York is the worthierambitious Warwick let thy betters speakthe cardinals not my better in the fieldall in this presence are thy betters Warwickwarwick may live to be the best of allpeace son and show some reason Buckinghamwhy Somerset should be preferred in thisbecause the king forsooth will have it somadam the king is old enough himselfto give his censure these are no womens mattersif he be old enough what needs your graceto be protector of his excellencemadam I am protector of the realmand at his pleasure will resign my placeresign it then and leave thine insolencesince thou wertking

to his legs againO master that you couldmy masters of Saint Albans have you not beadles in your town and things called whipsyes my lord if it please your gracethen send for one presentlysirrah go

done more miracles than Iyou made in a day my lord whole towns to flywhat tidings with our cousin Buckinghamsuch as my heart doth tremble to unfolda sort of naughty persons lewdly bentunder the countenance and confederacyof Lady Eleanor the protectors wifethe ringleader and head of all this routhave practised dangerously against your statedealing with witches and with conjurerswhom we have apprehended in the factraising up wicked spirits from under-grounddemanding of king Henrys life and deathand other of your highness privy counselas more at large your grace shall understandand so my lord Protector by this meansyour lady is forthcoming yet at Londonthis news I think hath turned your weapons edgeitis like my lord you will not keep your hourambitious churchman leave to afflict my heartsorrow and grief have vanquished all my powersand vanquished as I am I yield to theeor to the meanest groomO God what mischiefs work the wicked onesheaping confusion on their own heads therebygloucester see here the tainture of thy nestand look thyself be faultless thou wert bestmadam for myself to heaven I do appealhow I have loved my king and commonwealand for my wife I know not how it standssorry I am to hear what I have heardnoble she is but if she have forgothonour and virtue and conversed with suchas like to pitch defile nobilityI banish her my bed and companyand give her as a prey to law and shamethat hath dishonoured Gloucesters honest namewell for this night we will repose us hereto-morrow toward London back againto look into this business thoroughlyand call these foul offenders to their answersand poise the cause in justice equal scaleswhose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevailsnow my good lords of Salisbury and Warwickour simple supper ended give me leavein this close walk to satisfy myselfin craving your opinion of my titlewhich is infallible to Englands crownmy lord I long to hear it at fullsweet York begin and if thy claim be goodthe Nevils are thy subjects to commandthen thusedward the Third my lords had seven sonsthe first Edward the Black prince prince of Walesthe second William of Hatfield and the thirdlionel duke of Clarence next to whomwas John of gaunt the duke of Lancasterthe fifth was Edmund Langley duke of Yorkthe sixth was Thomas of woodstock duke of Gloucesterwilliam of windsor was the seventh and lastedward the Black prince died before his fatherand left behind him Richard his only sonwho after Edward the Thirds death reigned as kingtill Henry Bolingbroke duke of Lancasterthe eldest son and heir of John of gauntcrowned by the name of Henry the fourthseized on the realm deposed the rightful kingsent his poor queen to France from whence she cameand him to Pomfret where as all you knowharmless Richard was murdered traitorouslyfather the duke hath told the truththus got the house of Lancaster the crownwhich now they hold by force and not by rightfor Richard the first sons heir being deadthe issue of the next son should have reignedbut William of Hatfield died without an heirthe third son duke of Clarence from whose lineI claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughterwho married Edmund Mortimer earl of marchedmund had issue Roger earl of marchroger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanorthis Edmund in the reign of Bolingbrokeas I have read laid claim unto the crownand but for Owen Glendower had been kingwho kept him in captivity till he diedbut to the resthis eldest sister Annemy mother being heir unto the crownmarried Richard earl of Cambridge who was sonto Edmund Langley Edward the Thirds fifth sonby her I claim the kingdom she was heirto Roger earl of march who was the sonof Edmund Mortimer who married Philippesole daughter unto Lionel duke of Clarenceso if the issue of the eldest sonsucceed before the younger I am kingwhat plain proceeding is more plain than thishenry doth claim the crown from John of gauntthe fourth son York claims it from the thirdtill Lionels issue fails his should not reignit fails not yet but flourishes in theeand in thy sons fair slips of such a stockthen father Salisbury kneel we togetherand in this private plot be we the firstthat shall salute our rightful sovereignwith honour of his birthright to the crownlong live our sovereign Richard Englands kingwe thank you lords but I am not your kingtill I be crowned and that my sword be stainedwith heart-blood of the house of Lancasterand thats not suddenly to be performedbut with advice and silent secrecydo you as I do in these dangerous dayswink at the duke of Suffolks insolenceat Beauforts pride at Somersets ambitionat Buckingham and all the crew of themtill they have snared the shepherd of the flockthat virtuous prince the good duke Humphreyitis that they seek and they in seeking thatshall find their deaths if York can prophesymy lord break we off we know your mind at fullmy heart assures me that the earl of Warwickshall one day make the duke of York a kingand Nevil this I do assure myselfrichard shall live to make the earl of Warwickthe greatest man in England but the kingstand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucesters wifein sight of God and us your guilt is greatreceive the sentence of the law for sinssuch as by Gods book are adjudged to deathyou four from hence to prison back againfrom thence unto the place of executionthe witch in Smithfield shall be burned to ashesand you three shall be strangled on the gallowsyou madam for you are more nobly borndespoiled of your honour in your lifeshall after three days open penance donelive in your country here in banishmentwith sir John Stanley in the Isle of manwelcome is banishment welcome were my deatheleanor the law thou seest hath judged theeI cannot justify whom the law condemnsmine eyes are full of tears my heart of griefah Humphrey this dishonour in thine agewill bring thy head with sorrow to the groundI beseech your majesty give me leave to gosorrow would solace and mine age would easestay Humphrey duke of Gloucester ere thou gogive up thy staff Henry will to himselfprotector be and God shall be my hopemy stay my guide and lantern to my feetand go in peace Humphrey no less belovedthan when thou wert protector to thy kingI see no reason why a king of yearsshould be to be protected like a childgod and king Henry govern Englands helmgive up your staff sir and the king his realmmy staff here noble Henry is my staffas willingly do I the same resignas eer thy father Henry made it mineand even as willingly at thy feet I leave itas others would ambitiously receive itfarewell good king when I am dead and gonemay honourable peace attend thy thronewhy now is Henry king and Margaret queenand Humphrey duke of Gloucester scarce himselfthat bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at oncehis lady banished and a limb lopped offthis staff of honour raught there let it standwhere it best fits to be in Henrys handthus droops this lofty pine and hangs his spraysthus Eleanors pride

myselffor whilst I think I am thy wedded wifeand thou a prince protector of this landmethinks I should not thus be led alongmailed up in shame with papers on my backand followed with a rabble that rejoiceto see my tears and hear my deep-fet groansthe ruthless flint doth cut my tender feetand when I start the envious people laughand bid me be advised how I treadah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoketrowest thou that eer iull look upon the worldor count them happy that enjoy the sunno dark shall be my light and night my dayto think upon my pomp shall be my hellsometime iull say I am duke Humphreys wifeand he a prince and ruler of the landyet so he ruled and such a prince he wasas he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchesswas made a wonder and a pointing-stockto every idle rascal followerbut be thou mild and blush not at my shamenor stir at nothing till the axe of deathhang over thee as sure it shortly willfor Suffolk he that can do all in allwith her that hateth thee and hates us alland York and impious Beaufort that false priesthave all limed bushes to betray thy wingsand fly thou how thou canst theyll tangle theebut fear not thou until thy foot be snarednor never seek prevention of thy foesah Nell forbear thou aimest all awryI must offend before I be attaintedand had I twenty times so many foesand each of them had twenty times their powerall these could not procure me any scathso long as I am loyal true and crimelesswouldst have me rescue thee from this reproachwhy yet thy scandal were not wiped awaybut I in danger for the breach of lawthy greatest help is quiet gentle NellI pray thee sort thy heart to patiencethese few days wonder will be quickly wornI summon your grace to his majestys parliament holden at Bury the first of this next monthand my consent neer asked herein beforethis is close dealing well I will be theremy Nell I take my leave and master sherifflet not her penance exceed the kings commissionant please your grace here my commission staysand sir John Stanley is appointed nowto take her with him to the Isle of manmust you sir John protect my lady hereso am I given in charge mayt please your graceentreat her not the worse in that I prayyou use her well the world may laugh againand I may live to do you kindness ifyou do it her and so sir John farewellwhat gone my lord and bid me not farewellwitness my tears I cannot stay to speakart thou gone too All comfort go with theefor none abides with me my joy is deathdeath at whose name I oft have been afearedbecause I wished this worlds eternitystanley I prithee go and take me henceI care not whither for I beg no favouronly convey me where thou art commandedwhy madam that is to the Isle of manthere to be used according to your statethats bad enough for I am but reproachand shall I then be used reproachfullylike to a duchess and duke Humphreys ladyaccording to that state you shall be usedsheriff farewell and better than I farealthough thou hast been conduct of my shameit is my office and madam pardon meay ay farewell thy office is dischargedcome Stanley shall we gomadam your penance done throw off this sheetand go we to attire you for our journeymy shame will not be shifted with my sheetno it will hang upon my richest robesand show itself attire me how I cango lead the way I long to see my prisonI muse my lord of Gloucester is not comeitis not his wont to be the hindmost manwhateer occasion keeps him from us nowcan you not see or will ye not observethe strangeness of his altered countenancewith what a majesty he bears himselfhow insolent of late he is becomehow proud how peremptory and unlike himselfwe know the time since he was mild and affablean if we did but glance a far-off lookimmediately he was upon his kneethat all the court admired him for submissionbut meet him now and be it in the mornwhen everyone will give the time of dayhe knits his brow and shows an angry eyeand passeth by with stiff unbowed kneedisdaining duty that to us belongssmall curs are not regarded when they grinbut great men tremble when the lion roarsand Humphrey is no little man in Englandfirst note that he is near you in descentand should you fall he is the next will mountme seemeth then it is no policyrespecting what a rancorous mind he bearsand his advantage following your deceasethat he should come about your royal personor be admitted to your highness counselby flattery hath he won the commons heartsand when he please to make commotionitis to be feared they all will follow himnow itis the spring and weeds are shallow-rootedsuffer them now and theyll oergrow the gardenand choke the herbs for want of husbandrythe reverent care I bear unto my lordmade me collect these dangers in the dukeif it be fond call it a womans fearwhich fear if better reasons can supplantI will subscribe and say I wronged the dukemy lord of Suffolk Buckingham and Yorkreprove my allegation if you canor else conclude my words effectualwell hath your highness seen into this dukeand had I first been put to speak my mindI think I should have told your graces talethe duchess by his subornationupon my life began her devilish practicesor if he were not privy to those faultsyet by reputing of his high descentas next the king he was successive heirand such high vaunts of his nobilitydid instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchessby wicked means to frame our sovereigns fallsmooth runs the water where the brook is deepand in his simple show he harbours treasonthe fox barks not when he would steal the lambno no my sovreign Gloucester is a manunsounded yet and full of deep deceitdid he not contrary to form of lawdevise strange deaths for small offences doneand did he not in his protectorshiplevy great sums of money through the realmfor soldiers pay in France and never sent itby means whereof the towns each day revoltedtut these are petty faults to faults unknownwhich time will bring to light in smooth duke Humphreymy lords at once the care you have of usto mow down thorns that would annoy our footis worthy praise but shall I speak my consenceour kinsman Gloucester is as innocentfrom meaning treason to our royal personas is the sucking lamb or harmless dovethe duke is virtuous mild and too well givento dream on evil or to work my downfallah whats more dangerous than this fond affianceseems he a dove his feathers are but borrowedfor hes disposed as the hateful ravenis he a lamb his skin is surely lent himfor hes inclined as is the ravenous wolfwho cannot steal a shape that means deceittake heed my lord the welfare of us allhangs on the cutting short that fraudful manall health unto my gracious sovereignwelcome lord Somerset what news from Francethat all your interest in those territoriesis utterly bereft you all is lostcold news lord Somerset but Gods will be donecold news for me for I had hope of Franceas firmly as I hope for fertile Englandthus are my blossoms blasted in the budand caterpillars eat my leaves awaybut I will remedy this gear ere longor sell my title for a glorious graveall happiness unto my lord the kingpardon my liege that I have stayed so longnay Gloucester know that thou art come too soonunless thou wert more loyal than thou artI do arrest thee of high treason herewell Suffolks duke thou shalt not see me blushnor change my countenance for this arresta heart unspotted is not easily dauntedthe purest spring is not so free from mudas I am clear from treason to my sovereignwho can accuse me wherein am I guiltyitis thought my lord that you took bribes of Franceand being protector stayed the soldiers payby means whereof his highness hath lost Franceis it but thought so what are they that think itI never robbed the soldiers of their paynor ever had one penny bribe from Franceso help me God as I have watched the nightay night by night in studying good for Englandthat doit that eer I wrested from the kingor any groat I hoarded to my usebe brought against me at my trial-dayno many a pound of mine own proper storebecause I would not tax the needy commonshave I disbursed to the garrisonsand never asked for restitutionit serves you well my lord to say so muchI say no more than truth so help me Godin your protectorship you did devisestrange tortures for offenders never heard ofthat England was defamed by tyrannywhy itis well known that whiles I was protectorpity was all the fault that was in mefor I should melt at an offenders tearsand lowly words were ransom for their faultunless it were a bloody murdereror foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengersI never gave them condign punishmentmurder indeed that bloody sin I torturedabove the felon or what trespass elsemy lord these faults are easy quickly answeredbut mightier crimes are laid unto your chargewhereof you cannot easily purge yourselfI do arrest you in his highness nameand here commit you to my lord Cardinalto keep until your further time of trialmy lord of Gloucester itis my speal hopethat you will clear yourself from all suspectmy consence tells me you are innocentah gracious lord these days are dangerousvirtue is choked with foul ambitionand charity chased hence by rancours handfoul subornation is predominantand equity exiled your highness landI know their complot is to have my lifeand if my death might make this island happyand prove the period of their tyrannyI would expend it with all willingnessbut mine is made the prologue to their playfor thousands more that yet suspect no perilwill not conclude their plotted tragedybeauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts maliceand Suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hatesharp Buckingham unburdens with his tonguethe envious load that lies upon his heartand dogged York that reaches at the moonwhose overweening arm I have plucked backby false accuse doth level at my lifeand you my sovreign lady with the restcauseless have laid disgraces on my headand with your best endeavour have stirred upmy liefest liege to be mine enemyay all of you have laid your heads togethermyself had notice of your conventiclesand all to make away my guiltless lifeI shall not want false witness to condemn menor store of treasons to augment my guiltthe anent proverb will be well effecteda staff is quickly found to beat a dog my liege his railing is intolerableif those that care to keep your royal personfrom treasons secret knife and traitors ragebe thus upbraided chid and rated atand the offender granted scope of speechitwill make them cool in zeal unto your gracehath he not twit our sovereign lady herewith ignominious words though clerkly couchedas if she had suborned some to swearfalse allegations to oerthrow his statebut I can give the loser leave to chidefar truer spoke than meant I lose indeedbeshrew the winners for they played me falseand well such losers may have leave to speakhell wrest the sense and hold us here all daylord Cardinal he is your prisonersirs take away the duke and guard him sureah thus king Henry throws away his crutchbefore his legs be firm to bear his bodythus is the shepherd beaten from thy sideand wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee firstah that my fear were false ah that it werefor good king Henry thy decay I fearmy lords what to your wisdoms seemeth bestdo or undo as if ourself were herewhat will your highness leave the parliamentay Margaret my heart is drowned with griefwhose flood begins to flow within mine eyesmy body round engirt with miseryfor whats more miserable than discontentah uncle Humphrey in thy face I seethe map of honour truth and loyaltyand yet good Humphrey is the hour to comethat eer I proved thee false or feared thy faithwhat lowring star now envies thy estatethat these great lords and Margaret our queendo seek subversion of thy harmless lifethou never didst them wrong nor no man wrongand as the butcher takes away the calfand binds the wretch and beats it when it straysbearing it to the bloody slaughter-houseeven so remorseless have they borne him henceand as the dam runs lowing up and downlooking the way her harmless young one wentand can do nought but wail her darlings losseven so myself bewails good Gloucesters casewith sad unhelpful tears and with dimmed eyeslook after him and cannot do him goodso mighty are his vowed enemieshis fortunes I will weep and btwixt each groansay whos a traitor Gloucester he is none fair lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beamshenry my lord is cold in great affairstoo full of foolish pity and Gloucesters showbeguiles him as the mournful crocodilewith sorrow snares relenting passengersor as the snake rolled in a flowring bankwith shining checkered slough doth sting a childthat for the beauty thinks it excellentbelieve me lords were none more wise than Iand yet herein I judge mine own wit goodthis Gloucester should be quickly rid the worldto rid us from the fear we have of himthat he should die is worthy policyand yet we want a colour for his deathitis meet he be condemned by course of lawbut in my mind that were no policythe king will labour still to save his lifethe commons haply rise to save his lifeand yet we have but trivial argumentmore than mistrust that shows him worthy deathso that by this you would not have him dieah York no man alive so fain as Iitis York that hath more reason for his deathbut my lord Cardinal and you my lord of Suffolksay as you think and speak it from your soulswereit not all one an empty eagle were setto guard the chicken from a hungry kiteas place duke Humphrey for the kings protectorso the poor chicken should be sure of deathmadam itis true and wereit not madness thento make the fox surveyor of the foldwho being accused a crafty murdererhis guilt should be but idly posted overbecause his purpose is not executedno let him die in that he is a foxby nature proved an enemy to the flockbefore his chaps be stained with crimson bloodas Humphrey proved by reasons to my liegeand do not stand on quillets how to slay himbe it by gins by snares by subtiltysleeping or waking itis no matter howso he be dead for that is good deceitwhich mates him first that first intends deceitthrice noble Suffolk itis resolutely spokenot resolute except so much were donefor things are often spoke and seldom meantbut that my heart accordeth with my tongueseeing the deed is meritoriousand to preserve my sovereign from his foesay but the word and I will be his priestbut I would have him dead my lord of Suffolkere you can take due orders for a priestsay you consent and censure well the deedand iull provide his executionerI tender so the safety of my liegehere is my hand the deed is worthy doingand so say Iand I and now we three have spoke itit skills not greatly who impugns our doomgreat lords from Ireland am I come amainto signify that rebels there are upand put the Englishmen unto the swordsend succours lords and stop the rage betimebefore the wound do grow uncurablefor being green there is great hope of helpa breach that craves a quick expedient stopwhat counsel give you in this weighty causethat Somerset be sent as regent thitheritis meet that lucky ruler be employedwitness the fortune he hath had in Franceif York with all his far-fet policyhad been the regent there instead of mehe never would have stayed in France so longno not to lose it all as thou hast doneI rather would have lost my life betimesthan bring a burden of dishonour homeby staying there so long till all were lostshow me one scar charactered on thy skinmens flesh preserved so whole do seldom winnay then this spark will prove a raging fireif wind and fuel be brought to feed it withno more good York sweet Somerset be stillthy fortune York hadst thou been regent theremight happily have proved far worse than hiswhat worse than nought nay then a shame take alland in the number thee that wishest shamemy lord of York try what your fortune isthe unvil kerns of Ireland are in armsand temper clay with blood of Englishmento Ireland will you lead a band of mencollected choicely from each county someand try your hap against the IrishmenI will my lord so please his majestywhy our authority is his consentand what we do establish he confirmsthen noble York take thou this task in handI am content provide me soldiers lordswhiles I take order for mine own affairsa charge lord York that I will see performedbut now return we to the false duke Humphreyno more of him for I will deal with himthat henceforth he shall trouble us no moreand so break off the day is almost spentlord Suffolk you and I must talk of that eventmy lord of Suffolk within fourteen daysat Bristol I expect my soldiersfor there iull ship them all for Irelandiull see it truly done my lord of Yorknow York or never steel thy fearful thoughtsand change misdoubt to resolutionbe that thou hopest to be or what thou artresign to death it is not worth the enjoyinglet pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born manand find no harbour in a royal heartfaster than spring-time showers comes thought on thoughtand not a thought but thinks on dignitymy brain more busy than the labouring spiderweaves tedious snares to trap mine enemieswell nobles well itis politicly doneto send me packing with a host of menI fear me you but warm the starved snakewho cherished in your breasts will sting your heartsitwas men I lacked and you will give them meI take it kindly yet be well assuredyou put sharp weapons in a madmans handswhiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty bandI will stir up in England some black stormshall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or helland this fell tempest shall not cease to rageuntil the golden rcuit on my headlike to the glorious suns transparent beamsdo calm the fury of this mad-bred flawand for a minister of my intentI have seduced a headstrong Kentishmanjohn Cade of Ashfordto make commotion as full well he canunder the title of John Mortimerin Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cadeoppose himself against a troop of kernsand fought so long till that his thighs with dartswere almost like a sharp-quilled porpentineand in the end being rescued I have seenhim caper upright like a wild Moriscoshaking the bloody darts as he his bellsfull often like a shag-haired crafty kernhath he conversed with the enemyand undiscovered come to me againand given me notice of their villaniesthis devil here shall be my substitutefor that John Mortimer which now is deadin face in gait in speech he doth resembleby this I shall perceive the commons mindhow they affect the house and claim of Yorksay he be taken racked and torturedI know no pain they can inflict upon himwill make him say I moved him to those armssay that he thrive as itis great like he willwhy then from Ireland come I with my strengthand reap the harvest which that rascal sowedfor Humphrey being dead as he shall beand Henry put apart the next for merun to my lord of Suffolk let him knowwe have dispatched the duke as he commandedO that it were to do what have we donedidst ever hear a man so penitenthere comes my lordnow sirs have you dispatched this thingay my good lord hes deadwhy thats well said go get you to my houseI will reward you for this venturous deedthe king and all the peers are here at handhave you laid fair the bed is all things wellaccording as I gave directionsitis my good lordaway be gonego call our uncle to our presence straightsay we intend to try his grace to-dayif he be guilty as itis publishediull call him presently my noble lordlords take your places and I pray you allproceed no straiter gainst our uncle Gloucesterthan from true evidence of good esteemhe be approved in practice culpablegod forbid any malice should prevailthat faultless may condemn a noblemanpray God he may acquit him of suspionI thank thee Meg these words content me muchhow now why lookest thou pale why tremblest thouwhere is our uncle whats the matter Suffolkdead in his bed my lord Gloucester is deadmarry God forfendgods secret judgment I did dream to-nightthe duke was dumb and could not speak a wordhow fares my lord help lords the king is deadrear up his body wring him by the noserun go help help O Henry ope thine eyeshe doth revive again madam be patientO heavenly Godhow fares my gracious lordcomfort my sovereign groous Henry comfortwhat doth my lord of Suffolk comfort mecame he right now to sing a ravens notewhose dismal tune bereft my vital powersand thinks he that the chirping of a wrenby crying comfort from a hollow breastcan chase away the first-conceived soundhide not thy poison with such sugared wordslay not thy hands on me forbear I saytheir touch affrights me as a serpents stingthou baleful messenger out of my sightupon thy eyeballs murderous tyrannysits in grim majesty to fright the worldlook not upon me for thine eyes are woundingyet do not go away come basiliskand kill the innocent gazer with thy sightfor in the shade of death I shall find joyin life but double death now Gloucesters deadwhy do you rate my lord of Suffolk thusalthough the duke was enemy to himyet he most christian-like laments his deathand for myself foe as he was to memight liquid tears or heart-offending groansor blood-consuming sighs recall his lifeI would be blind with weeping sick with groanslook pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighsand all to have the noble duke alivewhat know I how the world may deem of mefor it is known we were but hollow friendsit may be judged I made the duke awayso shall my name with slanders tongue be woundedand princes courts be filled with my reproachthis get I by his death Ay me unhappyto be a queen and crowned with infamyah woe is me for Gloucester wretched manbe woe for me more wretched than he iswhat dost thou turn away and hide thy faceI am no loathsome leper look on mewhat art thou like the adder waxen deafbe poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queenis all thy comfort shut in Gloucesters tombwhy then Dame Margaret was neer thy joyerect his statua and worship itand make my image but an alehouse signwas I for this nigh wracked upon the seaand twice by awkward wind from Englands bankdrove back again unto my native climewhat boded this but well forewarning winddid seem to say Seek not a scorpions nestnor set no footing on this unkind shore what did I then but cursed the gentle gustsand he that loosed them forth their brazen cavesand bid them blow towards Englands blessed shoreor turn our stern upon a dreadful rockyetolus would not be a murdererbut left that hateful office unto theethe pretty vaulting sea refused to drown meknowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shorewith tears as salt as sea through thy unkindnessthe splitting rocks cowered in the sinking sandsand would not dash me with their ragged sidesbecause thy flinty heart more hard than theymight in thy palace perish Margaretas far as I could ken thy chalky cliffswhen from thy shore the tempest beat us backI stood upon the hatches in the stormand when the dusky sky began to robmy earnest-gaping sight of thy lands viewI took a costly jewel from my necka heart it was bound in with diamondsand threw it towards thy land the sea received itand so I wished thy body might my heartand even with this I lost fair Englands viewand bid mine eyes be packing with my heartand called them blind and dusky spectaclesfor losing ken of Albions wished coasthow often have I tempted Suffolks tonguethe agent of thy foul inconstancyto sit and witch me as Ascanius didwhen he to madding Dido would unfoldhis fathers acts commenced in burning Troyam I not witched like her or thou not false like himay me I can no more Die Margaretfor Henry weeps that thou dost live so longit is reported mighty sovereignthat good duke Humphrey traitrously is murderedby Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauforts meansthe commons like an angry hive of beesthat want their leader scatter up and downand care not who they sting in his revengemyself have calmed their spleenful mutinyuntil they hear the order of his deaththat he is dead good Warwick itis too truebut how he died God knows not Henryenter his chamber view his breathless corpseand comment then upon his sudden deaththat shall I do my liege Stay Salisburywith the rude multitude till I returnO thou that judgest all things stay my thoughtsmy thoughts that labour to persuade my soulsome violent hands were laid on Humphreys lifeif my suspect be false forgive me Godfor judgment only doth belong to theefain would I go to chafe his paly lipswith twenty thousand kisses and to drainupon his face an ocean of salt tearsto tell my love unto his deaf dumb trunkand with my fingers feel his hand unfeelingbut all in vain are these mean obsequiesand to survey his dead and earthly imagewhat were it but to make my sorrow greatercome hither gracious sovereign view this bodythat is to see how deep my grave is madefor with his soul fled all my worldly solacefor seeing him I see my life in deathas surely as my soul intends to livewith that dread king that took our state upon himto free us from his fathers wrathful curseI do believe that violent hands were laidupon the life of this thrice-famed dukea dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tonguewhat instance gives lord Warwick for his vowsee how the blood is settled in his faceoft have I seen a timely-parted ghostof ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodlessbeing all descended to the labouring heartwho in the conflict that it holds with deathattracts the same for aidance gainst the enemywhich with the heart there cools and neer returnethto blush and beautify the cheek againbut see his face is black and full of bloodhis eyeballs further out than when he livedstaring full ghastly like a strangled manhis hair upreared his nostrils stretched with strugglinghis hands abroad displayed as one that graspedand tugged for life and was by strength subduedlook on the sheets his hair you see is stickinghis well-proportioned beard made rough and ruggedlike to the summers corn by tempest lodgedit cannot be but he was murdered herethe least of all these signs were probablewhy Warwick who should do the duke to deathmyself and Beaufort had him in protectionand we I hope sir are no murderersbut both of you were vowed duke Humphreys foesand you forsooth had the good duke to keepitis like you would not feast him like a friendand itis well seen he found an enemythen you belike suspect these noblemenas guilty of duke Humphreys timeless deathwho finds the heifer dead and bleeding freshand sees fast by a butcher with an axebut will suspect itwas he that made the slaughterwho finds the partridge in the puttocks nestbut may imagine how the bird was deadalthough the kite soar with unbloodied beakeven so suspious is this tragedyare you the butcher Suffolk wheres your knifeis Beaufort termed a kite where are his talonsI wear no knife to slaughter sleeping menbut heres a vengeful sword rusted with easethat shall be scoured in his rancorous heartthat slanders me with murders crimson badgesay if thou darest proud lord of Warwickshirethat I am faulty in duke Humphreys deathwhat dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare himhe dares not calm his contumelious spiritnor cease to be an arrogant controllerthough Suffolk dare him twenty thousand timesmadam be still with reverence may I sayfor every word you speak in his behalfis slander to your royal dignityblunt-witted lord ignoble in demeanourif ever lady wronged her lord so muchthy mother took into her blameful bedsome stern untutored churl and noble stockwas graft with crab-tree slip whose fruit thou artand never of the Nevils noble racebut that the guilt of murder bucklers theeand I should rob the deathsman of his feequitting thee thereby of ten thousand shamesand that my sovreigns presence makes me mildI would false murdrous coward on thy kneemake thee beg pardon for thy passed speechand say it was thy mother that thou meantestthat thou thyself wast born in bastardyand after all this fearful homage donegive thee thy hire and send thy soul to hellpernious blood-sucker of sleeping menthou shalt be waking while I shed thy bloodif from this presence thou darest go with meaway even now or I will drag thee henceunworthy though thou art iull cope with theeand do some service to duke Humphreys ghostwhat stronger breastplate than a heart untaintedthrice is he armed that hath his quarrel justand he but naked though locked up in steelwhose consence with injustice is corruptedwhat noise is thiswhy how now lords your wrathful weapons drawnhere in our presence dare you be so boldwhy what tumultuous clamour have we herethe traitorous Warwick with the men of Buryset all upon me mighty sovereignsirs stand apart the king shall know your minddread lord the commons send you word by meunless false Suffolk straight be done to deathor banished fair Englands territoriesthey will by violence tear him from your palaceand torture him with grievous lingering deaththey say by him the good duke Humphrey diedthey say in him they fear your highness deathand mere instinct of love and loyaltyfree from a stubborn opposite intentas being thought to contradict your likingmakes them thus forward in his banishmentthey say in care of your most royal personthat if your highness should intend to sleepand charge that no man should disturb your restin pain of your dislike or pain of deathyet notwithstanding such a strait edictwere there a serpent seen with forked tonguethat slily glided towards your majestyit were but necessary you were wakedlest being suffered in that harmful slumberthe mortal worm might make the sleep eternaland therefore do they cry though you forbidthat they will guard you wher you will or nofrom such fell serpents as false Suffolk iswith whose envenomed and fatal stingyour loving uncle twenty times his worththey say is shamefully bereft of lifean answer from the king my lord of Salisburyitis like the commons rude unpolished hindscould send such message to their sovereignbut you my lord were glad to be employedto show how quaint an orator you arebut all the honour Salisbury hath wonis that he was the lord ambassadorsent from a sort of tinkers to the kingan answer from the king or we will all break ingo Salisbury and tell them all from meI thank them for their tender loving careand had I not been ted so by themyet did I purpose as they do entreatfor sure my thoughts do hourly prophesymischance unto my state by Suffolks meansand therefore by his majesty I swearwhose far unworthy deputy I amhe shall not breathe infection in this airbut three days longer on the pain of deathO Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolkungentle queen to call him gentle Suffolkno more I say if thou dost plead for himthou wilt but add increase unto my wrathhad I but said I would have kept my wordbut when I swear it is irrevocableif after three days space thou here beest foundon any ground that I am ruler ofthe world shall not be ransom for thy lifecome Warwick come good Warwick go with meI have great matters to impart to theemischance and sorrow go along with youhearts discontent and sour afflictionbe playfellows to keep you companytheres two of you the devil make a thirdand threefold vengeance tend upon your stepscease gentle queen these execrationsand let thy Suffolk take his heavy leavefie coward woman and soft-hearted wretchhast thou not spirit to curse thine enemya plague upon them wherefore should I curse themwould curses kill as doth the mandrakes groanI would invent as bitter-searching termsas curst as harsh and horrible to heardelivered strongly through my fixed teethwith full as many signs of deadly hateas lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cavemy tongue should stumble in mine earnest wordsmine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flintmy hair be fixed on end as one distractay every joint should seem to curse and banand even now my burdened heart would breakshould I not curse them Poison be their drinkgall worse than gall the daintiest that they tastetheir sweetest shade a grove of cypress treestheir chiefest prospect murdering basiliskstheir softest touch as smart as lizards stingstheir music frightful as the serpents hissand boding screech-owls make the concert fullall the foul terrors in dark-seated hellenough sweet Suffolk thou tormentest thyselfand these dread curses like the sun gainst glassor like an over-charged gun recoiland turn the force of them upon thyselfyou bade me ban and will you bid me leavenow by the ground that I am banished fromwell could I curse away a winters nightthough standing naked on a mountain topwhere biting cold would never let grass growand think it but a minute spent in sportO let me entreat thee cease give me thy handthat I may dew it with my mournful tearsnor let the rain of heaven wet this placeto wash away my woeful monumentsO could this kiss be printed in thy handthat thou mightst think upon these by the sealthrough whom a thousand sighs are breathed for theeso get thee gone that I may know my griefitis but surmised whiles thou art standing byas one that surfeits thinking on a wantI will repeal thee or be well assuredadventure to be banished myselfand banished I am if but from theego speak not to me even now be goneO go not yet even thus two friends condemnedembrace and kiss and take ten thousand leavesloather a hundred times to part than dieyet now farewell and farewell life with theethus is poor Suffolk ten times banishedonce by the king and three times thrice by theeitis not the land I care for wert thou thencea wilderness is populous enoughso Suffolk had thy heavenly companyfor where thou art there is the world itselfwith every several pleasure in the worldand where thou art not desolationI can no more live thou to joy thy lifemyself to joy in nought but that thou livestwhither goes Vaux so fast what news I pritheeto signify unto his majestythat Cardinal Beaufort is at point of deathfor suddenly a grievous sickness took himthat makes him gasp and stare and catch the airblaspheming God and cursing men on earthsometime he talks as if duke Humphreys ghostwere by his side sometime he calls the kingand whispers to his pillow as to himthe secrets of his overcharged souland I am sent to tell his majestythat even now he cries aloud for himgo tell this heavy message to the kingay me what is this world what news are thesebut wherefore grieve I at an hours poor lossomitting Suffolks exile my souls treasurewhy only Suffolk mourn I not for theeand with the southern clouds contend in tearstheirs for the earths increase mine for my sorrowsnow get thee hence the king thou knowest is comingif thou be found by me thou art but deadif I depart from thee I cannot liveand in thy sight to die what were it elsebut like a pleasant slumber in thy laphere could I breathe my soul into the airas mild and gentle as the cradle babedying with mothers dug between its lipswhere from thy sight I should be raging madand cry out for thee to close up mine eyesto have thee with thy lips to stop my mouthso shouldst thou either turn my flying soulor I should breathe it so into thy bodyand then it lived in sweet Elysiumto die by thee were but to die in jestfrom thee to die were torture more than deathO let me stay befall what may befallaway though parting be a fretful corsiveit is applied to a deathful woundto France sweet Suffolk let me hear from theefor wheresoeer thou art in this worlds globeiull have an Iris that shall find thee outI goand take my heart with theea jewel locked into the woefullest caskthat ever did contain a thing of wortheven as a splitted bark so sunder wethis way fall I to deaththis way for mehow fares my lord speak Beaufort to thy sovereignif thou beest death iull give thee Englands treasureenough to purchase such another islandso thou wilt let me live and feel no painah

I make men live wher they will or noO torture me no more I will confessalive again then show me where he isiull give a thousand pound to look upon himhe hath no eyes the dust hath blinded themcomb down his hair look look it stands uprightlike lime-twigs set to catch my winged soulgive me some drink and bid the apothecarybring the strong poison that I bought of himO thou eternal Mover of the heavenslook with a gentle eye upon this wretchO beat away the busy meddling fiendthat lays strong siege unto this wretchs souland from his bosom purge this black despairsee how the pangs of death do make him grindisturb him not let him pass peaceablypeace to his soul if Gods good pleasure belord Cardinal if thou thinkest on heavens blisshold up thy hand make signal of thy hopehe dies and makes no sign O God forgive himso bad a death argues a monstrous lifeforbear to judge for we are sinners allclose up his eyes and draw the curtain closeand let us all to meditationthe gaudy blabbing and remorseful dayis crept into the bosom of the seaand now loud-howling wolves arouse the jadesthat drag the tragic melancholy nightwho with their drowsy slow and flagging wingsclip dead mens graves and from their misty jawsbreathe foul contagious darkness in the airtherefore bring forth the soldiers of our prizefor whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downshere shall they make their ransom on the sandor with their blood stain this discoloured shoremaster this prisoner freely give I theeand thou that art his mate make boot of thisthe otherwalter Whitmore is thy sharewhat is my ransom master let me knowa thousand crowns or else lay down your headand so much shall you give or off goes yourswhat think you much to pay two thousand crownsand bear the name and port of gentlemencut both the villains throats for die you shallthe lives of those which we have lost in fightcannot be counterpoised with such a petty sumiull give it sir and therefore spare my lifeand so will I and write home for it straightI lost mine eye in laying the prize aboardand therefore to revenge it shalt thou dieand so should these if I might have my willbe not so rash take ransom let him livelook on my George I am a gentlemanrate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paidand so am I my name is Walter Whitmorehow now why startest thou what doth death affrightthy name affrights me in whose sound is deatha cunning man did calculate my birthand told me that by Water I should dieyet let not this make thee be bloody-mindedthy name is gaultier being rightly soundedgaultier or Walter which it is I care notnever yet did base dishonour blur our namebut with our sword we wiped away the blottherefore when merchant-like I sell revengebroke be my sword my arms torn and defacedand I proclaimed a coward through the worldstay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a princethe duke of Suffolk William de la Polethe duke of Suffolk muffled up in ragsay but these rags are no part of the dukejove sometimes went disguised and why not Ibut Jove was never slain as thou shalt beobscure and lowly swain king Henrys bloodthe honourable blood of Lancastermust not be shed by such a jaded groomhast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrupbare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth muleand thought thee happy when I shook my headhow often hast thou waited at my cupfed from my trencher kneeled down at the boardwhen I have feasted with queen Margaretremember it and let it make thee crest-fallnay and allay this thy abortive pridehow in our voiding lobby hast thou stoodand duly waited for my coming forththis hand of mine hath writ in thy behalfand therefore shall it charm thy riotous tonguespeak captain shall I stab the forlorn swainfirst let my words stab him as he hath mebase slave thy words are blunt and so art thouconvey him hence and on our longboats sidestrike off his headthou darest not for thy ownyes Polepolepool sir Pool lorday kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirttroubles the silver spring where England drinksnow will I dam up this thy yawning mouthfor swallowing the treasure of the realmthy lips that kissed the queen shall sweep the groundand thou that smiledst at good duke Humphreys deathagainst the senseless winds shall grin in vainwho in contempt shall hiss at thee againand wedded be thou to the hags of hellfor daring to affy a mighty lordunto the daughter of a worthless kinghaving neither subject wealth nor diademby devilish policy art thou grown greatand like ambitious Sylla overgorgedwith gobbets of thy mothers bleeding heartby thee Anjou and Maine were sold to Francethe false revolting normans thorough theedisdain to call us lord and Picardyhath slain their governors surprised our fortsand sent the ragged soldiers wounded homethe princely Warwick and the Nevils allwhose dreadful swords were never drawn in vainas hating thee are rising up in armsand now the house of York thrust from the crownby shameful murder of a guiltless kingand lofty proud encroaching tyrannyburns with revenging fire whose hopeful coloursadvance our half-faced sun striving to shineunder the which is writ Invitis nubibusthe commons here in Kent are up in armsand to conclude reproach and beggaryis crept into the palace of our kingand all by thee away convey him henceO that I were a god to shoot forth thunderupon these paltry servile abject drudgessmall things make base men proud this villain herebeing captain of a pinnace threatens morethan Bargulus the strong Illyrian piratedrones suck not eagles blood but rob beehivesit is impossible that I should dieby such a lowly vassal as thyselfthy words move rage and not remorse in meI go of message from the queen to FranceI charge thee waft me safely cross the Channelwaltercome Suffolk I must waft thee to thy deathgelidus timor occupat artus itis thee I fearthou shalt have cause to fear before I leave theewhat are ye daunted now now will ye stoopmy gracious lord entreat him speak him fairsuffolks imperial tongue is stern and roughused to command untaught to plead for favourfar be it we should honour such as thesewith humble suit no rather let my headstoop to the block than these knees bow to anysave to the God of heaven and to my kingand sooner dance upon a bloody polethan stand uncovered to the vulgar groomtrue nobility is exempt from fearmore can I bear than you dare executehale him away and let him talk no morecome soldiers show what cruelty ye canthat this my death may never be forgotgreat men oft die by vile bezoniansa Roman sworder and banditto slavemurdered sweet Tully Brutus bastard handstabbed Julius Ceasar savage islanderspompey the great and Suffolk dies by piratesand as for these whose ransom we have setit is our pleasure one of them departtherefore come you with us and let him gothere let his head and lifeless body lieuntil the queen his mistress bury itO barbarous and bloody spectaclehis body will I bear unto the kingif he revenge it not yet will his friendsso will the queen that living held him dearcome and get thee a sword though made of a lath they have been up these two daysthey have the more need to sleep now thenI tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon itso he had need for itis threadbare well I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came upO miserable age virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-menthe nobility think scorn to go in leather apronsnay more the kings counselare no good workmentrue and yet it is said Labour in thy vocation which is as much to say as let the magistrates be labouring men and therefore should we be magistratesthou hast hit it for theres no better sign of a brave mind than a hard handI see them I see them theres Bests son

endure muchno question of that for I have seen him whipped three market-days togetherI fear neither sword nor firehe need not fear the sword for his coat is of proofbut methinks he should stand in fear of fire being burnt inthe hand for stealing of sheepbe brave then for your captain is brave and vows reformation there shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny the three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony to drink small beer All the realm shall be in common and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass and when I am king as king I will

grammar-school and whereas before our fore-fathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be used and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a paper-mill it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no christian car can endure to hear thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hanged them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live thou dost ride on a foot-cloth dost thou notwhat of thatmarry thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in

grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a mans stomach this hot weather and I think this word sallet was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when I have been dry and bravely marching it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in and now the word sallet must serve me to feed onlord who would live turmoiled in the courtand may enjoy such quiet walks as thesethis small inheritance my father left mecontenteth me and worth a monarchyI seek not to wax great by others waningor gather wealth I care not with what envysufficeth that I have maintains my stateand sends the poor well pleased from my gateheres the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for entering his

pardon methat I have given no answer all this whilemy mind was troubled with deep melancholythe cause why I have brought this army hitheris to remove proud Somerset from the kingseditious to his

entailthe crown to thee and to thine heirs for everconditionally that here thou take an oathto cease this vile war and whilst I liveto honour me as thy king and sovereignand neither by treason nor hostilityto seek to put me down and reign thyselfthis oath I willingly take and will performlong live king Henry Plantagenet embrace himand long live thou and these thy forward sonsnow York

gentle queen and I will staywho can be patient in such extremesah wretched man would I had died a maidand never seen thee never borne thee sonseeing thou hast proved so unnatural a fatherhath he deserved to lose his birthright thushadst thou but loved him half so well as Ior felt that pain which I did for him onceor nourished him as I did with my bloodthou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood thererather than have made that savage duke thine heirand disinherited thine only sonfather you cannot disinherit meif you be king why should not I succeedpardon me Margaret pardon me sweet sonthe earl of Warwick and the duke enforced meenforced thee art thou king and wilt be forcedI shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretchthou hast undone thyself thy son and meand given unto the house of York such headas thou shalt reign but by their sufferanceto entail him and his heirs unto the crownwhat is it but to make thy sepulchreand creep into it far before thy timewarwick is chancellor and the lord of Calaisstern faulconbridge commands the narrow seasthe duke is made protector of the realmand yet shalt thou be safe such safety findsthe trembling lamb environed with wolveshad I been there which am a silly womanthe soldiers should have tossed me on their pikesbefore I would have granted to that actbut thou preferrest thy life before thine honourand seeing thou dost I here divorce myselfboth from thy table Henry and thy beduntil that act of parliament be repealedwhereby my son is disinheritedthe northern lords that have forsworn thy colourswill follow mine if once they see them spreadand spread they shall be to thy foul disgraceand utter ruin of the house of Yorkthus do I leave thee come son lets awayour army is ready

may she be on that hateful dukewhose haughty spirit winged with desirewill cost my crown and like an empty eagletire on the flesh of me and of my sonthe loss of those three lords torments my heartiull write unto them and entreat them faircome cousin you shall be the messengerand I I hope shall reconle them allbrother though I be youngest give me leaveno I can better play the oratorbut I have reasons strong and forblewhy how now sons and brother at a strifewhat is your quarrel how began it firstno quarrel but a slight contentionabout whatabout that which concerns your grace and usthe crown of England father which is yoursmine boy not till king Henry be deadyour right depends not on his life or deathnow you are heir therefore enjoy it nowby giving the house of Lancaster leave to breatheit will outrun you father in the endI took an oath that he should quietly reignbut for a kingdom any oath may be brokenI would break a thousand oaths to reign one yearno God forbid your grace should be forswornI shall be if I claim by open wariull prove the contrary if youll hear me speakthou canst not son it is impossiblean oath is of no moment being not tookbefore a true and lawful magistratethat hath authority over him that swearshenry had none but did usurp the placethen seeing itwas he that made you to deposeyour oath my lord is vain and frivoloustherefore to arms and father do but thinkhow sweet a thing it is to wear a crownwithin whose rcuit is Elysiumand all that poets feign of bliss and joywhy do we linger thus I cannot restuntil the white rose that I wear be dyedeven in the lukewarm blood of Henrys heartrichard enough I will be king or diebrother thou shalt to London presentlyand whet on Warwick to this enterprisethou Richard shalt unto the duke of norfolkand tell him privily of our intentyou Edward shall unto my lord Cobhamwith whom the Kentishmen will willingly risein them I trust for they are soldierswitty courteous liberal full of spiritwhile you are thus employed what resteth morebut that I seek occasion how to riseand yet the king not privy to my driftnor any of the house of Lancasterbut stay what news why comest thou in such postthe queen with all the northern earls and lordsintend here to besiege you in your castleshe is hard by with twenty thousand menand therefore fortify your hold my lorday with my sword what thinkest thou that we fear themedward and Richard you shall stay with memy brother Montague shall post to Londonlet noble Warwick Cobham and the restwhom we have left protectors of the kingwith powerful policy strengthen themselvesand trust not simple Henry nor his oathsbrother I go iull win them fear it notand thus most humbly I do take my leavesir John and sir Hugh Mortimer mine unclesyou are come to Sandal in a happy hourthe army of the queen mean to besiege usshe shall not need well meet her in the fieldwhat with five thousand menay with five hundred father for a needa womans general what should we fearI hear their drums lets set our men in orderand issue forth and bid them battle straightfive men to twenty though the odds be greatI doubt not uncle of our victorymany a battle have I won in Francewhen as the enemy hath been ten to onewhy should I not now have the like successah whither shall I fly to scape their handsah tutor look where bloody Clifford comeschaplain away thy priesthood saves thy lifeas for the brat of this accursed dukewhose father slew my father he shall dieand I my lord will bear him companysoldiers away with himah Clifford murder not this innocent childlest thou be hated both of God and manhow now is he dead already Or is it fearthat makes him close his eyes iull open themso looks the pent-up lion oer the wretchthat trembles under his devouring pawsand so he walks insulting oer his preyand so he comes to rend his limbs asunderah gentle Clifford kill me with thy swordand not with such a cruel threatening looksweet Clifford hear me speak before I dieI am too mean a subject for thy wrathbe thou revenged on men and let me livein vain thou speakest poor boy my fathers bloodhath stopped the passage where thy words should enterthen let my fathers blood open it againhe is a man and Clifford cope with himhad I thy brethren here their lives and thinewere not revenge suffient for meno if I digged up thy forefathers gravesand hung their rotten coffins up in chainsit could not slake mine ire nor ease my heartthe sight of any of the house of Yorkis as a fury to torment my souland till I root out their accursed lineand leave not one alive I live in hellthereforeO let me pray before I take my deathto thee I pray sweet Clifford pity mesuch pity as my rapiers point affordsI never did thee harm why wilt thou slay methy father hathbut itwas ere I was bornthou hast one son for his sake pity melest in revenge thereof sith God is justhe be as miserably slain as Iah let me live in prison all my daysand when I give occasion of offencethen let me die for now thou hast no causeno causethy father slew my father therefore diediI faant laudis summa sit ista tuplantagenet I come Plantagenetand this thy sons blood cleaving to my bladeshall rust upon my weapon till thy bloodcongealed with this do make me wipe off boththe army of the queen hath got the fieldmy uncles both are slain in rescuing meand all my followers to the eager foeturn back and fly like ships before the windor lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolvesmy sons God knows what hath bechanced thembut this I know they have demeaned themselveslike men born to renown by life or deaththree times did Richard make a lane to meand thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came Edward to my sidewith purple falchion painted to the hiltin blood of those that had encountered himand when the hardiest warriors did retirerichard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomba sceptre or an earthly sepulchre with this we charged again but out alaswe bodged again as I have seen a swanwith bootless labour swim against the tideand spend her strength with over-matching wavesah hark the fatal followers do pursueand I am faint and cannot fly their furyand were I strong I would not shun their furythe sands are numbered that make up my lifehere must I stay and here my life must endcome bloody Clifford rough northumberlandI dare your quenchless fury to more rageI am your butt and I abide your shotyield to our mercy proud Plantagenetay to such mercy as his ruthless armwith downright payment showed unto my fathernow Phaethon hath tumbled from his carand made an evening at the noontide prickmy ashes as the phoenix may bring fortha bird that will revenge upon you alland in that hope I throw mine eyes to heavenscorning whateer you can afflict me withwhy come you not what multitudes and fearso cowards fight when they can fly no furtherso doves do peck the falcons pierng talonsso desperate thieves all hopeless of their livesbreathe out invectives gainst the officersO Clifford but bethink thee once againand in thy thought oer-run my former timeand if thou canst for blushing view this faceand bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardicewhose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere thisI will not bandy with thee word for wordbut buckle with thee blows twice two for onehold valiant Clifford for a thousand causesI would prolong awhile the traitors lifewrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberlandhold Clifford do not honour him so muchto prick thy finger though to wound his heartwhat valour were it when a cur doth grinfor one to thrust his hand between his teethwhen he might spurn him with his foot awayit is wars prize to take all vantagesand ten to one is no impeach of valouray ay so strives the woodcock with the ginso doth the cony struggle in the netso triumph thieves upon their conquered bootyso true men yield with robbers so oer-matchedwhat would your grace have done unto him nowbrave warriors Clifford and northumberlandcome make him stand upon this molehill herethat raught at mountains with outstretched armsyet parted but the shadow with his handwhat was it you that would be Englands kingwast you that revelled in our parliamentand made a preachment of your high descentwhere are your mess of sons to back you nowthe wanton Edward and the lusty Georgeand wheres that valiant crook-back prodigydicky your boy that with his grumbling voicewas wont to cheer his dad in mutiniesor with the rest where is your darling Rutlandlook York I stained this napkin with the bloodthat valiant Clifford with his rapiers pointmade issue from the bosom of the boyand if thine eyes can water for his deathI give thee this to dry thy cheeks withalalas poor York but that I hate thee deadlyI should lament thy miserable stateI prithee grieve to make me merry Yorkwhat hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrailsthat not a tear can fall for Rutlands deathwhy art thou patient man thou shouldst be madand I to make thee mad do mock thee thusstamp rave and fret that I may sing and dancethou wouldst be feeed I see to make me sportYork cannot speak unless he wear a crowna crown for York and lords bow low to himhold you his hands whilst I do set it onay marry sir now looks he like a kingay this is he that took king Henrys chairand this is he was his adopted heirbut how is it that great Plantagenetis crowned so soon and broke his solemn oathas I bethink me you should not be kingtill our king Henry had shook hands with deathand will you pale your head in Henrys gloryand rob his temples of the diademnow in his life against your holy oathO itis a fault too-too unpardonableoff with the crown and with the crown his headand whilst we breathe take time to do him deadthat is my office for my fathers sakenay stay lets hear the orisons he makesshe-wolf of France but worse than wolves of Francewhose tongue more poisons than the adders toothhow ill-beseeming is it in thy sexto triumph like an Amazonian trullupon their woes whom fortune captivatesbut that thy face is visor-like unchangingmade impudent with use of evil deedsI would assay proud queen to make thee blushto tell thee whence thou camest of whom derivedwere shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shamelessthy father bears the type of king of Naplesof both the Sils and Jerusalemyet not so wealthy as an English yeomanhath that poor monarch taught thee to insultit needs not nor it boots thee not proud queenunless the adage must be verifiedthat beggars mounted run their horse to deathitis beauty that doth oft make women proudbut God he knows thy share thereof is smallitis virtue that doth make them most admiredthe contrary doth make thee wondered atitis government that makes them seem divinethe want thereof makes thee abominablethou art as opposite to every goodas the Antipodes are unto usor as the south to the septentrionO tigers heart wrapped in a womans hidehow couldst thou drain the life-blood of the childto bid the father wipe his eyes withaland yet be seen to bear a womans facewomen are soft mild pitiful and flexiblethou stern obdurate flinty rough remorselessbiddest thou me rage why now thou hast thy wishwouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy willfor raging wind blows up incessant showersand when the rage allays the rain beginsthese tears are my sweet Rutlands obsequiesand every drop cries vengeance for his deathgainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwomanbeshrew me but his passion moves me sothat hardly can I check my eyes from tearsthat face of his the hungry cannibalswould not have touched would not have stained with bloodbut you are more inhuman more inexorableO ten times more than tigers of Hyrcaniasee ruthless queen a hapless fathers tearsthis cloth thou dippedst in blood of my sweet boyand I with tears do wash the blood awaykeep thou the napkin and go boast of thisand if thou tellest the heavy story rightupon my soul the hearers will shed tearsyea even my foes will shed fast-falling tearsand say Alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curseand in thy need such comfort come to theeas now I reap at thy too cruel handhard-hearted Clifford take me from the worldmy soul to heaven my blood upon your headshad he been slaughter-man to all my kinI should not for my life but weep with himto see how inly sorrow gripes his soulwhat weeping-ripe my lord northumberlandthink but upon the wrong he did us alland that will quickly dry thy melting tearsheres for my oath heres for my fathers deathand heres to right our gentlehearted kingopen thy gate of mercy gracious Godmy soul flies through these wounds to seek out theeoff with his head and set it on York gatesso York may overlook the town of YorkI wonder how our princely father scapedor whether he be scaped away or nofrom Cliffords and northumberlands pursuithad he been taen we should have heard the newshad he been slain we should have heard the newsor had he scaped methinks we should have heardthe happy tidings of his good escapehow fares my brother why is he so sadI cannot joy until I be resolvedwhere our right valiant father is becomeI saw him in the battle range aboutand watched him how he singled Clifford forthmethought he bore him in the thickest troopas doth a lion in a herd of neator as a bear encompassed round with dogswho having pinched a few and made them crythe rest stand all aloof and bark at himso fared our father with his enemiesso fled his enemies my war-like fathermethinks itis prize enough to be his sonsee how the morning opes her golden gatesand takes her farewell of the glorious sunhow well resembles it the prime of youthtrimmed like a younker pranng to his lovedazzle mine eyes or do I see three sunsthree glorious suns each one a perfect sunnot separated with the racking cloudsbut severed in a pale clear-shining skysee see they join embrace and seem to kissas if they vowed some league inviolablenow are they but one lamp one light one sunin this the heaven figures some eventitis wondrous strange the like yet never heard ofI think it tes us brother to the fieldthat we the sons of brave Plantageneteach one already blazing by our meedsshould notwithstanding join our lights togetherand over-shine the earth as this the worldwhateer it bodes henceforward will I bearupon my target three fair-shining sunsnay bear three daughters by your leave I speak ityou love the breeder better than the malebut what art thou whose heavy looks foretellsome dreadful story hanging on thy tongueah one that was a woeful looker-onwhen as the noble duke of York was slainyour princely father and my loving lordO speak no more for I have heard too muchsay how he died for I will hear it allenvironed he was with many foesand stood against them as the hope of Troyagainst the Greeks that would have entered Troybut Hercules himself must yield to oddsand many strokes though with a little axehew down and fell the hardest-timbered oakby many hands your father was subduedbut only slaughtered by the ireful armof unrelenting Clifford and the queenwho crowned the gracious duke in high despitelaughed in his face and when with grief he weptthe ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeksa napkin steeped in the harmless bloodof sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slainand after many scorns many foul tauntsthey took his head and on the gates of Yorkthey set the same and there it doth remainthe saddest spectacle that eer I viewedsweet duke of York our prop to lean uponnow thou art gone we have no staff no stayO Clifford boistrous Clifford thou hast slainthe flower of Europe for his chivalryand treacherously hast thou vanquished himfor hand to hand he would have vanquished theenow my souls palace is become a prisonah would she break from hence that this my bodymight in the ground be closed up in restfor never henceforth shall I joy againnever O never shall I see more joyI cannot weep for all my bodys moisturescarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heartnor can my tongue unload my hearts great burdenfor self-same wind that I should speak withalis kindling coals that fire all my breastand burn me up with flames that tears would quenchto weep is to make less the depth of grieftears then for babes blows and revenge for merichard I bear thy name iull venge thy deathor die renowned by attempting ithis name that valiant duke hath left with theehis dukedom and his chair with me is leftnay if thou be that princely eagles birdshow thy descent by gazing gainst the sunfor chair and dukedom throne and kingdom sayeither that is thine or else thou wert not hishow now fair lords what fare what news abroadgreat lord of Warwick if we should recountour baleful news and at each words delivrancestab poniards in our flesh till all were toldthe words would add more anguish than the woundsO valiant lord the duke of York is slainO Warwick Warwick that Plantagenetwhich held thee dearly as his souls redemptionis by the stern lord Clifford done to deathten days ago I drowned these news in tearsand now to add more measure to your woesI come to tell you things sith then befallenafter the bloody fray at Wakefield foughtwhere your brave father breathed his latest gasptidings as swiftly as the posts could runwere brought me of your loss and his departI then in London keeper of the kingmustered my soldiers gathered flocks of friendsand very well appointed as I thoughtmarched towards Saint Albans to intercept the queenbearing the king in my behalf alongfor by my scouts I was advertisedthat she was coming with a full intentto dash our late decree in parliamenttouching king Henrys oath and your successionshort tale to make we at Saint Albans metour battles joined and both sides fiercely foughtbut whether itwas the coldness of the kingwho looked full gently on his war-like queenthat robbed my soldiers of their heated spleenor whether itwas report of her successor more than common fear of Cliffords rigourwho thunders to his captives blood and deathI cannot judge but to conclude with truththeir weapons like to lightning came and wentour soldiers like the night-owls lazy flightor like a lazy thresher with a flailfell gently down as if they struck their friendsI cheered them up with justice of our causewith promise of high pay and great rewardsbut all in vain they had no heart to fightand we in them no hope to win the dayso that we fled the king unto the queenlord George your brother norfolk and myselfin haste post-haste are come to join with youfor in the marches here we heard you weremaking another head to fight againwhere is the duke of norfolk gentle Warwickand when came George from Burgundy to Englandsome six miles off the duke is with the soldiersand for your brother he was lately sentfrom your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundywith aid of soldiers to this needful waritwas odds belike when valiant Warwick fledoft have I heard his praises in pursuitbut neer till now his scandal of retirenor now my scandal Richard dost thou hearfor thou shalt know this strong right hand of minecan pluck the diadem from faint Henrys headand wring the awful sceptre from his fistwere he as famous and as bold in waras he is famed for mildness peace and prayerI know it well lord Warwick blame me notitis love I bear thy glories makes me speakbut in this troublous time whats to be doneshall we go throw away our coats of steeland wrap our bodies in black mourning gownsnumbring our Ave-maries with our beadsor shall we on the helmets of our foestell our devotion with revengeful armsif for the last say Ay and to it lordswhy therefore Warwick came to seek you outand therefore comes my brother Montagueattend me lords the proud insulting queenwith Clifford and the haught northumberlandand of their feather many more proud birdshave wrought the easy-melting king like waxhe swore consent to your successionhis oath enrolled in the parliamentand now to London all the crew are goneto frustrate both his oath and what besidemay make against the house of Lancastertheir power I think is thirty thousand strongnow if the help of norfolk and myselfwith all the friends that thou brave earl of marchamongst the loving Welshmen canst procurewill but amount to five and twenty thousandwhy Via to London will we march amainand once again bestride our foaming steedsand once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and flyay now methinks I hear great Warwick speakneer may he live to see a sunshine daythat cries Retire if Warwick bid him staylord Warwick on thy shoulder will I leanand when thou failest as God forbid the hourmust Edward fall which peril heaven forfendno longer earl of march but duke of Yorkthe next degree is Englands royal thronefor king of England shalt thou be proclaimedin every borough as we pass alongand he that throws not up his cap for joyshall for the fault make forfeit of his headking Edward valiant Richard Montaguestay we no longer dreaming of renownbut sound the trumpets and about our taskthen Clifford were thy heart as hard as steelas thou hast shown it flinty by thy deedsI come to pierce it or to give thee minethen strike up drums God and Saint George for ushow now what newsthe duke of norfolk sends you word by methe queen is coming with a puissant hostand craves your company for speedy counselwhy then it sorts brave warriors lets awaywelcome my lord to this brave town of Yorkyonders the head of that arch-enemythat sought to be encompassed with your crowndoth not the object cheer your heart my lorday as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrackto see this sight it irks my very soulwithhold revenge dear God itis not my faultnor wittingly have I infringed my vowmy gracious liege this too much lenityand harmful pity must be laid asideto whom do lions cast their gentle looksnot to the beast that would usurp their denwhose hand is that the forest bear doth licknot his that spoils her young before her facewho scapes the lurking serpents mortal stingnot he that sets his foot upon her backthe smallest worm will turn being trodden onand doves will peck in safeguard of their broodambitious York did level at thy crownthou smiling while he knit his angry browshe but a duke would have his son a kingand raise his issue like a loving sirethou being a king blessed with a goodly sondidst yield consent to disinherit himwhich argued thee a most unloving fatherunreasonable creatures feed their youngand though mans face be fearful to their eyesyet in protection of their tender oneswho hath not seen them even with those wingswhich sometime they have used with fearful flightmake war with him that climbed unto their nestoffering their own lives in their youngs defencefor shame my liege make them your precedentwere it not pity that this goodly boyshould lose his birthright by his fathers faultand long hereafter say unto his childwhat my great grandfather and grandsire gotmy careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boyand let his manly face which promisethsuccessful fortune steel thy melting heartto hold thine own and leave thine own with himfull well hath Clifford played the oratorinferring arguments of mighty forcebut Clifford tell me didst thou never hearthat things ill got had ever bad successand happy always was it for that sonwhose father for his hoarding went to helliull leave my son my virtuous deeds behindand would my father had left me no morefor all the rest is held at such a rateas brings a thousand-fold more care to keepthan in possession any jot of pleasureah cousin York would thy best friends did knowhow it doth grieve me that thy head is heremy lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nighand this soft courage makes your followers faintyou promised knighthood to our forward sonunsheathe your sword and dub him presentlyedward kneel downedward Plantagenet arise a knightand learn this lesson draw thy sword in rightmy gracious father by your kingly leaveiull draw it as apparent to the crownand in that quarrel use it to the deathwhy that is spoken like a toward princeroyal commanders be in readinessfor with a band of thirty thousand mencomes Warwick backing of the duke of Yorkand in the towns as they do march alongproclaims him king and many fly to himdarraign your battle for they are at handI would your highness would depart the fieldthe queen hath best success when you are absentay good my lord and leave us to our fortunewhy thats my fortune too therefore iull staybe it with resolution then to fightmy royal father cheer these noble lordsand hearten those that fight in your defenceunsheathe your sword good father cry Saint George now perjured Henry wilt thou kneel for graceand set thy diadem upon my heador bide the mortal fortune of the fieldgo rate thy minions proud insulting boybecomes it thee to be thus bold in termsbefore thy sovereign and thy lawful kingI am his king and he should bow his kneeI was adopted heir by his consentsince when his oath is broke for as I hearyou that are king though he do wear the crownhave caused him by new act of parliamentto blot out me and put his own son inand reason toowho should succeed the father but the sonare you there butcher O I cannot speakay crook-back here I stand to answer theeor any he the proudest of thy sortitwas you that killed young Rutland was it notay and old York and yet not satisfiedfor Gods sake lords give signal to the fightwhat sayst thou Henry wilt thou yield the crownwhy how now long-tongued Warwick dare you speakwhen you and I met at Saint Albans lastyour legs did better service than your handsthen itwas my turn to fly and now itis thineyou said so much before and yet you fleditwas not your valour Clifford drove me thenceno nor your manhood that durst make you staynorthumberland I hold thee reverentlybreak off the parley for scarce I can refrainthe execution of my big-swoln heartupon that Clifford that cruel child-killerI slew thy father callest thou him a childay like a dastard and a treacherous cowardas thou didst kill our tender brother Rutlandbut ere sun-set iull make thee curse the deedhave done with words my lords and hear me speakdefy them then or else hold close thy lipsI prithee give no limits to my tongueI am a king and privileged to speakmy liege the wound that bred this meeting herecannot be cured by words therefore be stillthen executioner unsheathe thy swordby him that made us all I am resolvedthat Cliffords manhood lies upon his tonguesay Henry shall I have my right or noa thousand men have broke their fasts to-daythat neer shall dine unless thou yield the crownif thou deny their blood upon thy headfor York in justice puts his armour onif that be right which Warwick says is rightthere is no wrong but everything is rightwhoever got thee there thy mother standsfor well I wot thou hast thy mothers tonguebut thou art neither like thy sire nor dambut like a foul misshapen stigmaticmarked by the destinies to be avoidedas venom toads or lizards dreadful stingsiron of Naples hid with English giltwhose father bears the title of a kingas if a channel should be called the seashamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraughtto let thy tongue detect thy base-born hearta wisp of straw were worth a thousand crownsto make this shameless callet know herselfhelen of Greece was fairer far than thoualthough thy husband may be Menelausand neer was Agamemnons brother wrongedby that false woman as this king by theehis father revelled in the heart of Franceand tamed the king and made the Dauphin stoopand had he matched according to his statehe might have kept that glory to this daybut when he took a beggar to his bedand graced thy poor sire with his bridal dayeven then that sunshine brewed a shower for himthat washed his fathers fortunes forth of Franceand heaped sedition on his crown at homefor what hath broached this tumult but thy pridehadst thou been meek our title still had sleptand we in pity of the gentle kinghad slipped our claim until another agebut when we saw our sunshine made thy springand that thy summer bred us no increasewe set the axe to thy usurping rootand though the edge hath something hit ourselvesyet know thou since we have begun to strikewell never leave till we have hewn thee downor bathed thy growing with our heated bloodsand in this resolution I defy theenot willing any longer conferencesince thou denyest the gentle king to speaksound trumpets let our bloody colours waveand either victory or else a gravestay Edwardno wrangling woman well no longer staythese words will cost ten thousand lives this dayforspent with toil as runners with a raceI lay me down a little while to breathefor strokes received and many blows repaidhave robbed my strong-knit sinews of their strengthand spite of spite needs must I rest a whilesmile gentle heaven or strike ungentle deathfor this world frowns and Edwards sun is cloudedhow now my lord what hap what hope of goodour hap is loss our hope but sad despairour ranks are broke and ruin follows uswhat counsel give you whither shall we flybootless is flight they follow us with wingsand weak we are and cannot shun pursuitah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyselfthy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunkbroached with the steely point of Cliffords lanceand in the very pangs of death he criedlike to a dismal clangor heard from farwarwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steedsthat stained their fetlocks in his smoking bloodthe noble gentleman gave up the ghostthen let the earth be drunken with our bloodiull kill my horse because I will not flywhy stand we like soft-hearted women herewailing our losses whiles the foe doth rageand look upon as if the tragedywere played in jest by counterfeiting actorshere on my knee I vow to God aboveiull never pause again never stand stilltill either death hath closed these eyes of mineof fortune given me measure of revengeO Warwick I do bend my knee with thineand in this vow do chain my soul to thineand ere my knee rise from the earths cold faceI throw my hands mine eyes my heart to theethou setter up and plucker down of kingsbeseeching thee if with thy will it standsthat to my foes this body must be preyyet that thy brazen gates of heaven may opeand give sweet passage to my sinful soulnow lords take leave until we meet againwhereer it be in heaven or in earthbrother give me thy hand and gentle Warwicklet me embrace thee in my weary armsI that did never weep now melt with woethat winter should cut off our spring-time soaway away Once more sweet lords farewellyet let us all together to our troopsand give them leave to fly that will not stayand call them pillars that will stand to usand if we thrive promise them such rewardsas victors wear at the Olympian gamesthis may plant courage in their quailing breastsfor yet is hope of life and victoryforslow no longer make we hence amainnow Clifford I have singled thee alonesuppose this arm is for the duke of Yorkand this for Rutland both bound to revengewert thou environed with a brazen wallnow Richard I am with thee here alonethis is the hand that stabbed thy father Yorkand this the hand that slew thy brother Rutlandand heres the heart that triumphs in their deathand cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brotherto execute the like upon thyselfand so have at theenay Warwick single out some other chasefor I myself will hunt this wolf to deaththis battle fares like to the mornings warwhen dying clouds contend with growing lightwhat time the shepherd blowing of his nailscan neither call it perfect day nor nightnow sways it this way like a mighty seaforced by the tide to combat with the windnow sways it that way like the self-same seaforced to retire by fury of the windsometime the flood prevails and then the windnow one the better then another bestboth tugging to be victors breast to breastyet neither conqueror nor conqueredso is the equal poise of this fell warhere on this molehill will I sit me downto whom God will there be the victoryfor Margaret my queen and Clifford toohave chid me from the battle swearing boththey prosper best of all when I am thencewould I were dead if Gods good will were sofor what is in this world but grief and woeO God methinks it were a happy lifeto be no better than a homely swainto sit upon a hill as I do nowto carve out dials quaintly point by pointthereby to see the minutes how they runhow many make the hour full completehow many hours bring about the dayhow many days will finish up the yearhow many years a mortal man may livewhen this is known then to divide the timesso many hours must I tend my flockso many hours must I take my restso many hours must I contemplateso many hours must I sport myselfso many days my ewes have been with youngso many weeks ere the poor fools will eanso many years ere I shall shear the fleeceso minutes hours days months and yearspassed over to the end they were createdwould bring white hairs unto a quiet graveah what a life were this how sweet how lovelygives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shadeto shepherds looking on their silly sheepthan doth a rich embroidered canopyto kings that fear their subjects treacheryO yes it doth a thousand-fold it dothand to conclude the shepherds homely curdshis cold thin drink out of his leather bottlehis wonted sleep under a fresh trees shadeall which secure and sweetly he enjoysis far beyond a princes delicateshis viands sparkling in a golden cuphis body couched in a curious bedwhen care mistrust and treason wait on himill blows the wind that profits nobodythis man whom hand to hand I slew in fightmay be possessed with some store of crownsand I that haply take them from him nowmay yet ere night yield both my life and themto some man else as this dead man doth mewhos this O God it is my fathers facewhom in this conflict I unwares have killedO heavy times begetting such eventsfrom London by the king was I pressed forthmy father being the earl of Warwicks mancame on the part of York pressed by his masterand I who at his hands received my lifehave by my hands of life bereaved himpardon me God I knew not what I didand pardon father for I knew not theemy tears shall wipe away these bloody marksand no more words till they have flowed their fillO piteous spectacle O bloody timeswhiles lions war and battle for their denspoor harmless lambs abide their enmityweep wretched man iull aid thee tear for tearand let our hearts and eyes like civil warbe blind with tears and break oercharged with griefthou that so stoutly hast resisted megive me thy gold if thou hast any goldfor I have bought it with a hundred blowsbut let me see is this our foemans faceah no no no it is mine only sonah boy if any life be left in theethrow up thine eye see see what showers ariseblown with the windy tempest of my heartupon thy wounds that kill mine eye and heartO pity God this miserable agewhat stratagems how fell how butcherlyerroneous mutinous and unnaturalthis deadly quarrel daily doth begetO boy thy father gave thee life too soonand hath bereft thee of thy life too latewoe above woe grief more than common griefO that my death would stay these ruthful deedsO pity pity gentle heaven pitythe red rose and the white are on his facethe fatal colours of our striving housesthe one his purple blood right well resemblesthe other his pale cheeks methinks presentethwither one rose and let the other flourishif you contend a thousand lives must witherhow will my mother for a fathers deathtake on with me and neer be satisfiedhow will my wife for slaughter of my sonshed seas of tears and neer be satisfiedhow will the country for these woeful chancesmisthink the king and not be satisfiedwas ever son so rued a fathers deathwas ever father so bemoaned a sonwas ever king so grieved for subjects woemuch is your sorrow mine ten times so muchiull bear thee hence where I may weep my fillthese arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheetmy heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchrefor from my heart thine image neer shall gomy sighing breast shall be thy funeral belland so obsequious will thy father beeen for the loss of thee having no moreas Priam was for all his valiant sonsiull bear thee hence and let them fight that willfor I have murdered where I should not killsad-hearted men much overgone with carehere sits a king more woeful than you arefly father fly for all your friends are fledand Warwick rages like a chafed bullaway for death doth hold us in pursuitmount you my lord towards Berwick post amainedward and Richard like a brace of greyhoundshaving the fearful flying hare in sightwith fiery eyes sparkling for very wrathand bloody steel grasped in their ireful handsare at our backs and therefore hence amainaway for vengeance comes along with themnay stay not to expostulate make speedor else come after iull away beforenay take me with thee good sweet Exeternot that I fear to stay but love to gowhither the queen intends forward awayhere burns my candle out ay here it dieswhich while it lasted gave king Henry lightO Lancaster I fear thy overthrowmore than my bodys parting with my soulmy love and fear glued many friends to theeand now I fall thy tough commixtures meltimpairing Henry strengthening misproud Yorkthe common people swarm like summer fliesand whither fly the gnats but to the sunand who shines now but Henrys enemiesO Phoebus hadst thou never given consentthat Phaethon thon should check thy fiery steedsthy burning car never had scorched the earthand Henry hadst thou swayed as kings should door as thy father and his father didgiving no ground unto the house of Yorkthey never then had sprung like summer fliesI and ten thousand in this luckless realmhad left no mourning widows for our deathand thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peacefor what doth cherish weeds but gentle airand what makes robbers bold but too much lenitybootless are plaints and cureless are my woundsno way to fly nor strength to hold out flightthe foe is merless and will not pityfor at their hands I have deserved no pitythe air hath got into my deadly woundsand much effuse of blood doth make me faintcome York and Richard Warwick and the restI stabbed your fathers bosoms split my breastnow breathe we lords good fortune bids us pauseand smooth the frowns of war with peaceful lookssome troops pursue the bloody-minded queenthat led calm Henry though he were a kingas doth a sail filled with a fretting gustcommand an argosy to stern the wavesbut think you lords that Clifford fled with themno itis impossible he should escapefor though before his face I speak the wordsyour brother Richard marked him for the graveand wheresoeer he is hes surely deadwhose soul is that which takes her heavy leavea deadly groan like life and deaths departingsee who it is and now the battles endedif friend or foe let him be gently usedrevoke that doom of mercy for itis Cliffordwho not contented that he lopped the branchin hewing Rutland when his leaves put forthbut set his murdring knife unto the rootfrom whence that tender spray did sweetly springI mean our princely father duke of Yorkfrom off the gates of York fetch down the headyour fathers head which Clifford placed thereinstead whereof let this supply the roommeasure for measure must be answeredbring forth that fatal screech-owl to our housethat nothing sung but death to us and oursnow death shall stop his dismal threatening soundand his ill-boding tongue no more shall speakI think his understanding is bereftspeak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to theedark cloudy death oershades his beams of lifeand he nor sees nor hears us what we sayO would he did and so perhaps he dothitis but his policy to counterfeitbecause he would avoid such bitter tauntswhich in the time of death he gave our fatherif so thou thinkest vex him with eager wordsclifford ask mercy and obtain no graceclifford repent in bootless penitenceclifford devise excuses for thy faultswhile we devise fell tortures for thy faultsthou didst love York and I am son to Yorkthou pitiedst Rutland I will pity theewheres captain Margaret to fence you nowthey mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wontwhat not an oath nay then the world goes hardwhen Clifford cannot spare his friends an oathI know by that hes dead and by my soulif this right hand would buy two hours lifethat I in all despite might rail at himthis hand should chop it off and with the issuing bloodstifle the villain whose unstaunched thirstYork and young Rutland could not satisfyay but hes dead off with the traitors headand rear it in the place your fathers standsand now to London with triumphant marchthere to be crowned Englands royal kingfrom whence shall Warwick cut the sea to Franceand ask the Lady Bona for thy queenso shalt thou sinew both these lands togetherand having France thy friend thou shalt not dreadthe scattered foe that hopes to rise againfor though they cannot greatly sting to hurtyet look to have them buzz to offend thine earsfirst will I see the coronationand then to Brittany iull cross the seato effect this marriage so it please my lordeven as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it befor on thy shoulder do I build my seatand never will I undertake the thingwherein thy counsel and consent is wantingrichard I will create thee duke of Gloucesterand George of Clarence Warwick as ourselfshall do and undo as him pleaseth bestlet me be duke of Clarence George of Gloucesterfor Gloucesters dukedom is too ominoustut thats a foolish observationrichard be duke of Gloucester now to Londonto see these honours in possessionunder this thick-grown hrake well shroud ourselvesfor through this laund anon the deer will comeand in this covert will we make our standculling the prinpal of all the deeriull stay above the hill so both may shootthat cannot be the noise of thy cross-bowwill scare the herd and so my shoot is losthere stand we both and aim we at the bestand for the time shall not seem tediousiull tell thee what befell me on a dayin this self place where now we mean to standhere comes a man lets stay till he be pastfrom Scotland am I stoln even of pure loveto greet mine own land with my wishful sightno Harry Harry itis no land of thinethy place is filled thy sceptre wrung from theethy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointedno bending knee will call thee Ceasar nowno humble suitors press to speak for rightno not a man comes for redress of theefor how can I help them and not myselfay heres a deer whose skins a keepers feethis is the quondam king lets seize upon himlet me embrace thee sour adversityfor wise men say it is the wisest coursewhy linger we let us lay hands upon himforbear awhile well hear a little moremy queen and son are gone to France for aidand as I hear the great commanding Warwickis thither gone to crave the French kings sisterto wife for Edward if this news be truepoor queen and son your labour is but lostfor Warwick is a subtle oratorand Lewis a prince soon won with moving wordsby this account then Margaret may win himfor shes a woman to be pitied muchher sighs will make a battery in his breasther tears will pierce into a marble heartthe tiger will be mild whiles she doth mournand Nero will be tainted with remorseto hear and see her plaints her brinish tearsay but shes come to beg Warwick to giveshe on his left side craving aid for Henryhe on his right asking a wife for Edwardshe weeps and says her Henry is deposedhe smiles and says his Edward is installedthat she poor wretch for grief can speak no morewhiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wronginferreth arguments of mighty strengthand in conclusion wins the king from herwith promise of his sister and what elseto strengthen and support king Edwards placeO Margaret thus itwill be and thou poor soulart then forsaken as thou wentest forlornsay what art thou that talkest of kings and queensmore than I seem and less than I was born toa man at least for less I should not beand men may talk of kings and why not Iay but thou talkest as if thou wert a kingwhy so I am in mind and thats enoughbut if thou be a king where is thy crownmy crown is in my heart not on my headnot decked with diamonds and Indian stonesnor to be seen my crown is called contenta crown it is that seldom kings enjoywell if you be a king crowned with contentyour crown content and you must be contentedto go along with us for as we thinkyou are the king king Edward hath deposedand we his subjects sworn in all allegiancewill apprehend you as his enemybut did you never swear and break an oathno never such an oath nor will not nowwhere did you dwell when I was king of Englandhere in this country where we now remainI was anointed king at nine months oldmy father and my grandfather were kingsand you were sworn true subjects unto meand tell me then have you not broke your oathsnofor we were subjects but while you were kingwhy am I dead do I not breathe a manah simple men you know not what you swearlook as I blow this feather from my faceand as the air blows it to me againobeying with my wind when I do blowand yielding to another when it blowscommanded always by the greater gustsuch is the lightness of you common menbut do not break your oaths for of that sinmy mild entreaty shall not make you guiltygo where you will the king shall be commandedand be you kings command and iull obeywe are true subjects to the king king Edwardso would you be again to Henryif he were seated as king Edward iswe charge you in Gods name and in the kingsto go with us unto the officersin Gods name lead your kings name be obeyedand what God will that let your king performand what he will I humbly yield untobrother of Gloucester at Saint Albans fieldthis ladys husband sir John Grey was slainhis lands then seized on by the conquerorher suit is now to repossess those landswhich we in justice cannot well denybecause in quarrel of the house of Yorkthe worthy gentleman did lose his lifeyour highness shall do well to grant her suitit were dishonour to deny it herit were no less but yet iull make a pauseyea is it soI see the lady hath a thing to grantbefore the king will grant her humble suithe knows the game how true he keeps the windsilencewidow we will consider of your suitand come some other time to know our mindright gracious lord I cannot brook delaymay it please your highness to resolve me nowand what your pleasure is shall satisfy meay widow then iull warrant you all your landsan if what pleases him shall pleasure youfight closer or good faith youll catch a blowI fear her not unless she chance to fallgod forbid that for hell take vantageshow many children hast thou widow tell meI think he means to beg a child of hernay whip me then hell rather give her twothree my most gracious lordyou shall have four if youll be ruled by himitwere pity they should lose their fathers landsbe pitiful dread lord and grant it thenlords give us leave iull try this widows witay good leave have you for you will have leavetill youth take leave and leave you to the crutchnow tell me madam do you love your childrenay full as dearly as I love myselfand would you not do much to do them goodto do them good I would sustain some harmthen get your husbands lands to do them goodtherefore I came unto your majestyiull tell you how these lands are to be gotso shall you bind me to your highness servicewhat service wilt thou do me if I give themwhat you command that rests in me to dobut you will take exceptions to my boonno gracious lord except I cannot do itay but thou canst do what I mean to askwhy then I will do what your grace commandshe plies her hard and much rain wears the marbleas red as fire nay then her wax must meltwhy stops my lord shall I not hear my taskan easy task itis but to love a kingthats soon performed because I am a subjectwhy then thy husbands lands I freely give theeI take my leave with many thousand thanksthe match is made she seals it with a curtsybut stay thee itis the fruits of love I meanthe fruits of love I mean my loving liegeay but I fear me in another sensewhat love thinkest thou I sue so much to getmy love till death my humble thanks my prayersthat love which virtue begs and virtue grantsno by my troth I did not mean such lovewhy then you mean not as I thought you didbut now you partly may perceive my mindmy mind will never grant what I perceiveyour highness aims at if I aim arightto tell thee plain I aim to lie with theeto tell you plain I had rather lie in prisonwhy then thou shalt not have thy husbands landswhy then mine honesty shall be my dowerfor by that loss I will not purchase themtherein thou wrongest thy children mightilyherein your highness wrongs both them and mebut mighty lord this merry inclinationaccords not with the sadness of my suitplease you dismiss me either with ay or no ay if thou wilt say ay to my requestno if thou dost say no to my demandthen no my lord my suit is at an endthe widow likes him not she knits her browshe is the bluntest wooer in Christendomher looks do argue her replete with modestyher words do show her wit incomparableall her perfections challenge sovereigntyone way or other she is for a kingand she shall be my love or else my queensay that king Edward take thee for his queenitis better said than done my gracious lordI am a subject fit to jest withalbut far unfit to be a sovereignsweet widow by my state I swear to theeI speak no more than what my soul intendsand that is to enjoy thee for my loveand that is more than I will yield untoI know I am too mean to be your queenand yet too good to be your concubineyou cavil widow I did mean my queenitwill grieve your grace my sons should call you fatherno more than when my daughters call thee motherthou art a widow and thou hast some childrenand by Gods mother I being but a bachelorhave other some why itis a happy thingto be the father unto many sonsanswer no more for thou shalt be my queenthe ghostly father now hath done his shriftwhen he was made a shriver itwas for shiftbrothers you muse what chat we two have hadthe widow likes it not for she looks very sadyoued think it strange if I should marry herto whom my lordwhy Clarence to myselfthat would be ten days wonder at the leastthats a day longer than a wonder lastsby so much is the wonder in extremeswell jest on brothers I can tell you bothher suit is granted for her husbands landsmy gracious lord Henry your foe is takenand brought as prisoner to your palace gatesee that he be conveyed unto the Towerand go we brothers to the man that took himto question of his apprehensionwidow go you along lords use her honourablyay Edward will use women honourablywould he were wasted marrow bones and allthat from his loins no hopeful branch may springto cross me from the golden time I look forand yet between my souls desire and methe lustful Edwards title buriedis Clarence Henry and his son young Edwardand all the unlooked for issue of their bodiesto take their rooms ere I can place myselfa cold premeditation for my purposewhy then I do but dream on sovereigntylike one that stands upon a promontoryand spies a far-off shore where he would treadwishing his foot were equal with his eyeand chides the sea that sunders him from thencesaying hell lade it dry to have his wayso do I wish the crown being so far offand so I chide the means that keep me from itand so I say iull cut the causes offflattering me with impossibilitiesmy eyes too quick my heart oerweens too muchunless my hand and strength could equal themwell say there is no kingdom then for Richardwhat other pleasure can the world affordiull make my heaven in a ladys lapand deck my body in gay ornamentsand witch sweet ladies with my words and looksO miserable thought and more unlikelythan to accomplish twenty golden crownswhy love forswore me in my mothers womband for I should not deal in her soft lawsshe did corrupt frail nature with some bribeto shrink mine arm up like a withered shrubto make an envious mountain on my backwhere sits deformity to mock my bodyto shape my legs of an unequal sizeto disproportion me in every partlike to a chaos or an unlicked bear-whelpthat carries no impression like the damand am I then a man to be belovedO monstrous fault to harbour such a thoughtthen since this earth affords no joy to mebut to command to check to oerbear suchas are of better person than myselfiull make my heaven to dream upon the crownand whiles I live to account this world but helluntil my mis-shaped trunk that bears this headbe round impaled with a glorious crownand yet I know not how to get the crownfor many lives stand between me and homeand I like one lost in a thorny woodthat rents the thorns and is rent with the thornsseeking a way and straying from the waynot knowing how to find the open airbut toiling desperately to find it outtorment myself to catch the English crownand from that torment I will free myselfor hew my way out with a bloody axewhy I can smile and murder while I smileand cry Content to that which grieves my heartand wet my cheeks with artifial tearsand frame my face to all occasionsiull drown more sailors than the mermaid shalliull slay more gazers than the basiliskiull play the orator as well as Nestordeceive more slily than Ulysses couldand like a Sinon take another TroyI can add colours to the chameleonchange shapes with Proteus for advantagesand set the murdrous Machiavel to schoolcan I do this and cannot get a crowntut were it further off iull pluck it downfair queen of England worthy Margaretsit down with us it ill befits thy stateand birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sitno mighty king of France now Margaretmust strike her sail and learn a while to servewhere kings command I was I must confessgreat Albions queen in former golden daysbut now mischance hath trod my title downand with dishonour laid me on the groundwhere I must take like seat unto my fortuneand to my humble seat conform myselfwhy say fair queen whence springs this deep despairfrom such a cause as fills mine eyes with tearsand stops my tongue while heart is drowned in careswhateer it be be thou still like thyselfand sit thee by our sideyield not thy neckto fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mindstill ride in triumph over all mischancebe plain queen Margaret and tell thy griefit shall be eased if France can yield reliefthose gracious words revive my drooping thoughtsand give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speaknow therefore be it known to noble Lewisthat Henry sole possessor of my loveis of a king become a banished manand forced to live in Scotland a forlornwhile proud ambitious Edward duke of Yorkusurps the regal title and the seatof Englands true-anointed lawful kingthis is the cause that I poor Margaretwith this my son prince Edward Henrys heiram come to crave thy just and lawful aidand if thou fail us all our hope is donescotland hath will to help but cannot helpour people and our peers are both misledour treasure seized our soldiers put to flightand as thou seest ourselves in heavy plightrenowned queen with patience calm the stormwhile we bethink a means to break it offthe more we stay the stronger grows our foethe more I stay the more iull succour theeO but impatience waiteth on true sorrowand see where comes the breeder of my sorrowwhats he approacheth boldly to our presenceour earl of Warwick Edwards greatest friendwelcome brave Warwick what brings thee to Franceay now begins a second storm to risefor this is he that moves both wind and tidefrom worthy Edward king of Albionmy lord and sovereign and thy vowed friendI come in kindness and unfeigned lovefirst to do greetings to thy royal personand then to crave a league of amityand lastly to confirm that amitywith nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grantthat virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sisterto Englands king in lawful marriageif that go forward Henrys hope is doneand gracious madam in our kings behalfI am commanded with your leave and favourhumbly to kiss your hand and with my tongueto tell the passion of my sovreigns heartwhere fame late entering at his heedful earshath placed thy beautys image and thy virtueking Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speakbefore you answer Warwick his demandsprings not from Edwards well-meant honest lovebut from deceit bred by necessityfor how can tyrants safely govern homeunless abroad they purchase great allianceto prove him tyrant this reason may sufficethat Henry liveth still but were he deadyet here prince Edward stands king Henrys sonlook therefore Lewis that by this league and marriagethou draw not on thy danger and dishonourfor though usurpers sway the rule awhileyet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongsinjurious Margaretand why not queenbecause thy father Henry did usurpand thou no more art prince than she is queenthen Warwick disannuls great John of gauntwhich did subdue the greatest part of Spainand after John of gaunt Henry the fourthwhose wisdom was a mirror to the wisestand after that wise prince Henry the fifthwho by his prowess conquered all Francefrom these our Henry lineally descendsoxford how haps it in this smooth discourseyou told not how Henry the Sixth hath lostall that which Henry the fifth had gottenmethinks these peers of France should smile at thatbut for the rest you tell a pedigreeof threescore and two years a silly timeto make prescription for a kingdoms worthwhy Warwick canst thou speak against thy liegewhom thou obeyedst thirty and six yearsand not bewray thy treason with a blushcan Oxford that did ever fence the rightnow buckler falsehood with a pedigreefor shame leave Henry and call Edward kingcall him my king by whose injurious doommy elder brother the lord Aubrey Verewas done to death and more than so my fathereven in the downfall of his mellowed yearswhen nature brought him to the door of deathno Warwick no while life upholds this armthis arm upholds the house of Lancasterand I the house of Yorkqueen Margaret prince Edward and Oxfordvouchsafe at our request to stand asidewhile I use further conference with Warwickheaven grant that Warwicks words bewitch him notnow Warwick tell me even upon thy consenceis Edward your true king for I were loathto link with him that were not lawful chosenthereon I pawn my credit and mine honourbut is he gracious in the peoples eyethe more that Henry was unfortunatethen further all dissembling set asidetell me for truth the measure of his loveunto our sister Bonasuch it seemsas may beseem a monarch like himselfmyself have often heard him say and swearthat this his love was an eternal plantwhereof the root was fixed in virtues groundthe leaves and fruit maintained with beautys sunexempt from envy but not from disdainunless the Lady Bona quit his painnow sister let us hear your firm resolveyour grant or your denial shall be mineyet I confess that often ere this daywhen I have heard your kings desert recountedmine ear hath tempted judgment to desirethen Warwick thus our sister shall be Edwardsand now forthwith shall articles be drawntouching the jointure that your king must makewhich with her dowry shall be counterpoiseddraw near queen Margaret and be a witnessthat Bona shall be wife to the English kingto Edward but not to the English kingdeceitful Warwick it was thy deviceby this alliance to make void my suitbefore thy coming Lewis was Henrys friendand still is friend to him and Margaretbut if your title to the crown be weakas may appear by Edwards good successthen itis but reason that I be releasedfrom giving aid which late I promisedyet shall you have all kindness at my handthat your estate requires and mine can yieldhenry now lives in Scotland at his easewhere having nothing nothing can he loseand as for you yourself our quondam queenyou have a father able to maintain youand better itwere you troubled him than Francepeace impudent and shameless Warwick peaceproud setter up and puller down of kingsI will not hence till with my talk and tearsboth full of truth I make king Lewis beholdthy sly conveyance and thy lords false lovefor both of you are birds of self-same featherwarwick this is some post to us or theemy lord ambassador these letters are for yousent from your brother Marquess Montaguethese from our king unto your majestyand madam these for you from whom I know notI like it well that our fair queen and mistresssmiles at her news while Warwick frowns at hisnay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettledI hope alls for the bestwarwick what are thy news and yours fair queenmine such as fill my heart with unhoped joysmine full of sorrow and hearts discontentwhat has your king married the Lady Greyand now to soothe your forgery and hissends me a paper to persuade me patienceis this the alliance that he seeks with Francedare he presume to scorn us in this mannerI told your majesty as much beforethis proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honestyking Lewis I here protest in sight of heavenand by the hope I have of heavenly blissthat I am clear from this misdeed of Edwardsno more my king for he dishonours mebut most himself if he could see his shamedid I forget that by the house of Yorkmy father came untimely to his deathdid I let pass the abuse done to my niecedid I impale him with the regal crowndid I put Henry from his native rightand am I guerdoned at the last with shameshame on himself for my desert is honourand to repair my honour lost for himI here renounce him and return to Henrymy noble queen let former grudges passand henceforth I am thy true servitorI will revenge his wrong to Lady Bonaand replant Henry in his former statewarwick these words have turned my hate to loveand I forgive and quite forget old faultsand joy that thou becomest king Henrys friendso much his friend ay his unfeigned friendthat if king Lewis vouchsafe to furnish uswith some few bands of chosen soldiersiull undertake to land them on our coastand force the tyrant from his seat by waritis not his new-made bride shall succour himand as for Clarence as my letters tell mehes very likely now to fall from himfor matching more for wanton lust than honouror than for strength and safety of our countrydear brother how shall Bona be revengedbut by thy help to this distressed queenrenowned prince how shall poor Henry liveunless thou rescue him from foul despairmy quarrel and this English queens are oneand mine fair Lady Bona joins with yoursand mine with hers and thine and Margaretstherefore at last I firmly am resolvedyou shall have aidlet me give humble thanks for all at oncethen Englands messenger return in postand tell false Edward thy supposed kingthat Lewis of France is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bridethou seest whats past go fear thy king withaltell him in hope hell prove a widower shortlyiull wear the willow garland for his saketell him my mourning weeds are laid asideand I am ready to put armour ontell him from me that he hath done me wrongand therefore iull uncrown him eret be longtheres thy reward be gonebut Warwickthou and Oxford with five thousand menshall cross the seas and bid false Edward battleand as occasion serves this noble queenand prince shall follow with a fresh supplyyet ere thou go but answer me one doubtwhat pledge have we of thy firm loyaltythis shall assure my constant loyaltythat if our queen and this young prince agreeiull join mine eldest daughter and my joyto him forthwith in holy wedlock bandsyes I agree and thank you for your motionson Edward she is fair and virtuoustherefore delay not give thy hand to Warwickand with thy hand thy faith irrevocablethat only Warwicks daughter shall be thineyes I accept her for she well deserves itand here to pledge my vow I give my handwhy stay we now these soldiers shall be leviedand thou lord Bourbon our high admiralshall waft them over with our royal fleetI long till Edward fall by wars mischancefor mocking marriage with a dame of FranceI came from Edward as ambassadorbut I return his sworn and mortal foematter of marriage was the charge he gave mebut dreadful war shall answer his demandhad he none else to make a stale but methen none but I shall turn his jest to sorrowI was the chief that raised him to the crownand iull be chief to bring him down againnot that I pity Henrys miserybut seek revenge on Edwards mockerynow tell me brother Clarence what think youof this new marriage with the Lady Greyhath not our brother made a worthy choicealas you know itis far from hence to Francehow could he stay till Warwick made returnmy lords forbear this talk here comes the kingand his well-chosen brideI mind to tell him plainly what I thinknow brother Clarence how like you our choicethat you stand pensive as half malcontentas well as Lewis of France or the earl of Warwickwhich are so weak of courage and in judgmentthat theyll take no offence at our abusesuppose they take offence without a causethey are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edwardyour king and Warwicks and must have my willand you shall have your will because our kingyet hasty marriage seldom proveth wellyea brother Richard are you offended toonot Ino God forbid that I should wish them severedwhom God hath joined together ay and itwere pityto sunder them that yoke so well togethersetting your scorns and your mislike asidetell me some reason why the Lady Greyshould not become my wife and Englands queenand you too Somerset and Montaguespeak freely what you thinkthen this is mine opinion that king Lewisbecomes your enemy for mocking himabout the marriage of the Lady Bonaand Warwick doing what you gave in chargeis now dishonoured by this new marriagewhat if both Lewis and Warwick be appeasedby such invention as I can deviseyet to have joined with France in such alliancewould more have strengthened this our commonwealthgainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriagewhy knows not Montague that of itselfengland is safe if true within itselfyes but the safer when itis backed with Franceitis better using France than trusting Francelet us be backed with God and with the seaswhich he hath given for fence impregnableand with their helps only defend ourselvesin them and in ourselves our safety liesfor this one speech lord hastings well deservesto have the heir of the lord Hungerforday what of that it was my will and grantand for this once my will shall stand for lawand yet methinks your grace hath not done wellto give the heir and daughter of lord Scalesunto the brother of your loving brideshe better would have fitted me or Clarencebut in your bride you bury brotherhoodor else you would not have bestowed the heirof the lord Bonville on your new wifes sonand leave your brothers to go speed elsewherealas poor Clarence is it for a wifethat thou art malcontent I will provide theein choosing for yourself you showed your judgmentwhich being shallow you shall give me leaveto play the broker on mine own behalfand to that end I shortly mind to leave youleave me or tarry Edward will be kingand not be tied unto his brothers willmy lords before it pleased his majestyto raise my state to title of a queendo me but right and you must all-confessthat I was not ignoble of descentand meaner than myself have had like fortunebut as this title honours me and mineso your dislikes to whom I would be pleasingdo cloud my joys with danger and with sorrowmy love forbear to fawn upon their frownswhat danger or what sorrow can befall theeso long as Edward is thy constant friendand their true sovereign whom they must obeynay whom they shall obey and love thee toounless they seek for hatred at my handswhich if they do yet will I keep thee safeand they shall feel the vengeance of my wrathI hear yet say not much but think the morenow messenger what letters or what newsfrom Francemy sovereign liege no letters and few wordsbut such as I without your speal pardondare not relatego to we pardon thee therefore in brieftell me their words as near as thou canst guess themwhat answer makes king Lewis unto our lettersat my depart these were his very wordsgo tell false Edward thy supposed kingthat Lewis of France is sending over masquersto revel it with him and his new bride is Lewis so brave belike he thinks me Henrybut what said Lady Bona to my marriagethese were her words uttered with mild disdaintell him in hope hell prove a widower shortlyiull wear the willow garland for his sake I blame not her she could say little lessshe had the wrong but what said Henrys queenfor I have heard that she was there in placetell him quoth she my mourning weeds are doneand I am ready to put armour on belike she minds to play the Amazonbut what said Warwick to these injurieshe more incensed against your majestythan all the rest discharged me with these wordstell him from me that he hath done me wrongand therefore iull uncrown him eret be long ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud wordswell I will arm me being thus forewarnedthey shall have wars and pay for their presumptionbut say is Warwick friends with Margaretay gracious sovereign they are so linked in friendshipthat young prince Edward marries Warwicks daughterbelike the elder Clarence will have the youngernow brother king farewell and sit you fastfor I will hence to Warwicks other daughterthat though I want a kingdom yet in marriageI may not prove inferior to yourselfyou that love me and Warwick follow menot Imy thoughts aim at a further matter Istay not for love of Edward but the crownclarence and Somerset both gone to Warwickyet am I armed against the worst can happenand haste is needful in this desperate casepembroke and Stafford you in our behalfgo levy men and make prepare for warthey are already or quickly will be landedmyself in person will straight follow youbut ere I go hastings and Montagueresolve my doubt you twain of all the restare near to Warwick by blood and by alliancetell me if you love Warwick more than meif it be so then both depart to himI rather wish you foes than hollow friendsbut if you mind to hold your true obediencegive me assurance with some friendly vowthat I may never have you in suspectso God help Montague as he proves trueand hastings as he favours Edwards causenow brother Richard will you stand by usay in despite of all that shall withstand youwhy so then am I sure of victorynow therefore let us hence and lose no hourtill we meet Warwick with his foreign powertrust me my lord all hitherto goes wellthe common people by numbers swarm to usbut see where Somerset and Clarence comespeak suddenly my lords are we all friendsfear not that my lordthen gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwickand welcome Somerset I hold it cowardiceto rest mistrustful where a noble hearthath pawned an open hand in sign of loveelse might I think that Clarence Edwards brotherwere but a feigned friend to our proceedingsbut welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thineand now what rests but in nights coverturethy brother being carelessly encampedhis soldiers lurking in the towns aboutand but attended by a simple guardwe may surprise and take him at our pleasureour scouts have found the adventure very easythat as Ulysses and stout Diomedewith sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tentsand brought from thence the Thraan fatal steedsso we well covered with the nights black mantleat unawares may beat down Edwards guardand seize himself I say not slaughter himfor I intend but only to surprise himyou that will follow me to this attemptapplaud the name of Henry with your leaderwhy then lets on our way in silent sortfor Warwick and his friends God and Saint Georgecome on my masters each man take his standthe king by this is set him down to sleepwhat will he not to bedwhy no for he hath made a solemn vownever to lie and take his natural resttill Warwick or himself be quite suppressedto-morrow then belike shall be the dayif Warwick be so near as men reportbut say I pray what nobleman is thatthat with the king here resteth in his tentitis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friendO is it so but why commands the kingthat his chief followers lodge in towns about himwhile he himself keeps in the cold fielditis the more honour because the more dangerousay but give me worship and quietnessI like it better than a dangerous honourif Warwick knew in what estate he standsitis to be doubted he would waken himunless our halberds did shut up his passageay wherefore else guard we his royal tentbut to defend his person from night-foesthis is his tent and see where stand his guardcourage my masters honour now or neverbut follow me and Edward shall be ourswho goes therestay or thou diestwhat are they that fly thererichard and hastings let them go heres the dukethe duke why Warwick when we parted lastthou calledst me kingay but the case is alteredwhen you disgraced me in my embassadethen I degraded you from being kingand come now to create you duke of Yorkalas how should you govern any kingdomthat know not how to use ambassadorsnor how to be contented with one wifenor how to use your brothers brotherlynor how to study for the peoples welfarenor how to shroud yourself from enemiesyea brother of Clarence art thou here toonay then I see that Edward needs must downyet Warwick in despite of all mischanceof thee thyself and all thy complicesedward will always bear himself as kingthough fortunes malice overthrow my statemy mind exceeds the compass of her wheelthen for his mind be Edward Englands kingbut Henry now shall wear the English crownand be true king indeed thou but the shadowmy lord of Somerset at my requestsee that forthwith duke Edward be conveyedunto my brother Archbishop of Yorkwhen I have fought with Pembroke and his fellowsiull follow you and tell what answerlewis and the Lady Bona send to himnow for a while farewell good duke of Yorkwhat fates impose that men must needs abideit boots not to resist both wind and tidewhat now remains my lords for us to dobut march to London with our soldiersay thats the first thing that we have to doto free king Henry from imprisonmentand see him seated in the regal thronemadam what makes you in this sudden changewhy brother Rivers are you yet to learnwhat late misfortune is befalln king Edwardwhat loss of some pitched battle against Warwickno but the loss of his own royal personthen is my sovereign slainay almost slain for he is taken prisonereither betrayed by falsehood of his guardor by his foe surprised at unawaresand as I further have to understandis new committed to the Bishop of Yorkfell Warwicks brother and by that our foethese news I must confess are full of griefyet gracious madam bear it as you maywarwick may lose that now hath won the daytill then fair hope must hinder lifes decayand I the rather wean me from despairfor love of Edwards offspring in my wombthis is it that makes me bridle passionand bear with mildness my misfortunes crossay ay for this I draw in many a tearand stop the rising of blood-sucking sighslest with my sighs or tears I blast or drownking Edwards fruit true heir to the English crownbut madam where is Warwick then becomeI am informed that he comes towards Londonto set the crown once more on Henrys headguess thou the rest king Edwards friends must downbut to prevent the tyrants violencefor trust not him that hath once broken faithiull hence forthwith unto the sanctuaryto save at least the heir of Edwards rightthere shall I rest secure from force and fraudcome therefore let us fly while we may flyif Warwick take us we are sure to dienow my lord hastings and sir William Stanleyleave off to wonder why I drew you hitherinto this chiefest thicket of the parkthus stands the case you know our king my brotheris prisoner to the bishop here at whose handshe hath good usage and great libertyand often but attended with weak guardcomes hunting this way to disport himselfI have advertised him by secret meansthat if about this hour he make this wayunder the colour of his usual gamehe shall here find his friends with horse and mento set him free from his captivitythis way my lord for this way lies the gamenay this way man see where the huntsmen standnow brother of Gloucester lord hastings and the reststand you thus close to steal the bishops deerbrother the time and case requireth hasteyour horse stands ready at the park cornerbut whither shall we thento Lynn my lord and ship from thence to Flanderswell guessed believe me for that was my meaningstanley I will requite thy forwardnessbut wherefore stay we itis no time to talkhuntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go alongbetter do so than tarry and be hangedcome then away lets ha no more adobishop farewell shield thee from Warwicks frownand pray that I may repossess the crownmaster lieutenant now that God and friendshave shaken Edward from the regal seatand turned my captive state to libertymy fear to hope my sorrows unto joysat our enlargement what are thy due feessubjects may challenge nothing of their sovereignsbut if a humble prayer may prevailI then crave pardon of your majestyfor what lieutenant for well using menay be thou sure iull well requite thy kindnessfor that it made my imprisonment a pleasureay such a pleasure as encaged birdsconceive when after many moody thoughtsat last by notes of household harmonythey quite forget their loss of libertybut Warwick after God thou setest me freeand chiefly therefore I thank God and theehe was the author thou the instrumenttherefore that I may conquer fortunes spiteby living low where fortune cannot hurt meand that the people of this blessed landmay not be punished with my thwarting starswarwick although my head still wear the crownI here resign my government to theefor thou art fortunate in all thy deedsyour grace hath still been famed for virtuousand now may seem as wise as virtuousby spying and avoiding fortunes malicefor few men rightly temper with the starsyet in this one thing let me blame your gracefor choosing me when Clarence is in placeno Warwick thou art worthy of the swayto whom the heavens in thy nativityadjudged an olive branch and laurel crownas likely to be blest in peace and warand therefore I yield thee my free consentand I choose Clarence only for protectorwarwick and Clarence give me both your handsnow join your hands and with your hands your heartsthat no dissension hinder governmentI make you both protectors of this landwhile I myself will lead a private lifeand in devotion spend my latter daysto sins rebuke and my Creators praisewhat answers Clarence to his sovereigns willthat he consents if Warwick yield consentfor on thy fortune I repose myselfwhy then though loath yet must I be contentwell yoke together like a double shadowto Henrys body and supply his placeI mean in bearing weight of governmentwhile he enjoys the honour and his easeand Clarence now then it is more than needfulforthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitorand all his lands and goods be confiscatewhat else and that succession be determineday therein Clarence shall not want his partbut with the first of all your chief affairslet me entreat for I command no morethat Margaret your queen and my son Edwardbe sent for to return from France with speedfor till I see them here by doubtful fearmy joy of liberty is half eclipsedit shall be done my sovreign with all speedmy lord of Somerset what youth is thatof whom you seem to have so tender caremy liege it is young Henry earl of Richmondcome hither Englands hopeif secret powerssuggest but truth to my divining thoughtsthis pretty lad will prove our countrys blisshis looks are full of peaceful majestyhis head by nature framed to wear a crownhis hand to wield a sceptre and himselflikely in time to bless a regal thronemake much of him my lords for this is hemust help you more than you are hurt by mewhat news my friendthat Edward is escaped from your brotherand fled as he hears since to Burgundyunsavoury news but how made he escapehe was conveyed by Richard duke of Gloucesterand the lord hastings who attended himin secret ambush on the forest sideand from the bishops huntsmen rescued himfor hunting was his daily exersemy brother was too careless of his chargebut let us hence my sovereign to providea salve for any sore that may betidemy lord I like not of this flight of Edwardsfor doubtless Burgundy will yield him helpand we shall have more wars beforet be longas Henrys late presaging prophecydid glad my heart with hope of this young Richmondso doth my heart misgive me in these conflictswhat may befall him to his harm and ourstherefore lord Oxford to prevent the worstforthwith well send him hence to Brittanytill storms be past of civil enmityay for if Edward repossess the crownitis like that Richmond with the rest shall downit shall be so he shall to Brittanycome therefore lets about it speedilynow brother Richard lord hastings and the restyet thus far fortune maketh us amendsand says that once more I shall interchangemy waned state for Henrys regal crownwell have we passed and now repassed the seasand brought desired help from Burgundywhat then remains we being thus arrivedfrom Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of Yorkbut that we enter as into our dukedomthe gates made fast Brother I like not thisfor many men that stumble at the thresholdare well foretold that danger lurks withintush man abodements must not now affright usby fair or foul means we must enter infor hither will our friends repair to usmy liege iull knock once more to summon themmy lords we were forewarned of your comingand shut the gates for safety of ourselvesfor now we owe allegiance unto Henrybut master mayor if Henry be your kingyet Edward at the least is duke of Yorktrue my good lord I know you for no lesswhy and I challenge nothing but my dukedomas being well content with that alonebut when the fox hath once got in his nosehell soon find means to make the body followwhy master mayor why stand you in a doubtopen the gates we are king Henrys friendsay say you so the gates shall then be openeda wise stout captain and soon persuadedthe good old man would fain that all were wellso itwere not long of him but being enteredI doubt not I but we shall soon persuadeboth him and all his brothers unto reasonso master mayor these gates must not be shutbut in the night or in the time of warwhat fear not man but yield me up the keysfor Edward will defend the town and theeand all those friends that deign to follow mebrother this is sir John Montgomeryour trusty friend unless I be deceivedwelcome sir John but why come you in armsto help king Edward in his time of stormas every loyal subject ought to dothanks good Montgomery but we now forgetour title to the crown and only claimour dukedom till God please to send the restthen fare you well for I will hence againI came to serve a king and not a dukedrummer strike up and let us march awaynay stay sir John awhile and well debateby what safe means the crown may be recoveredwhat talk you of debating in few wordsif youll not here proclaim yourself our kingiull leave you to your fortune and be goneto keep them back that come to succour youwhy shall we fight if you pretend no titlewhy brother wherefore stand you on nice pointswhen we grow stronger then well make our claimtill then itis wisdom to conceal our meaningaway with scrupulous wit now arms must ruleand fearless minds climb soonest unto crownsbrother we will proclaim you out of handthe bruit thereof will bring you many friendsthen be it as you will for itis my rightand Henry but usurps the diademay now my sovreign speaketh like himselfand now will I be Edwards championsound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaimedcome fellow soldier make thou proclamationedward the fourth by the grace of God king of England and France and lord of Ireland etcetera and whosoeer gainsays king Edwards rightby this I challenge him to single fightlong live Edward the fourththanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you allif fortune serve me iull requite this kindnessnow for this night lets harbour here in Yorkand when the morning sun shall raise his carabove the border of this horizonwell forward towards Warwick and his matesfor well I wot that Henry is no soldierah froward Clarence how evil it beseems theeto flatter Henry and forsake thy brotheryet as we may well meet both thee and Warwickcome on brave soldiers doubt not of the dayand that once gotten doubt not of large paywhat counsel lords Edward from Belgiawith hasty Germans and blunt Hollandershath passed in safety through the narrow seasand with his troops doth march amain to Londonand many giddy people flock to himlets levy men and beat him back againa little fire is quickly trodden outwhich being suffered rivers cannot quenchin Warwickshire I have true-hearted friendsnot mutinous in peace yet bold in warthose will I muster up and thou son Clarenceshalt stir up in Suffolk norfolk and in Kentthe knights and gentlemen to come with theethou brother Montague in Buckinghamnorthampton and in Leicestershire shalt findmen well inclined to hear what thou commandestand thou brave Oxford wondrous well belovedin Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friendsmy sovreign with the loving tizenslike to his island girt in with the oceanor modest Dian rcled with her nymphsshall rest in London till we come to himfair lords take leave and stand not to replyfarewell my sovereignfarewell my Hector and my Troys true hopein sign of truth I kiss your highness handwell-minded Clarence be thou fortunatecomfort my lord and so I take my leaveand thus I seal my truth and bid adieusweet Oxford and my loving Montagueand all at once once more a happy farewellfarewell sweet lords lets meet at Coventryhere at the palace will I rest awhilecousin of Exeter what thinks your lordshipmethinks the power that Edward hath in fieldshould not be able to encounter minethe doubt is that he will seduce the restthats not my fear my meed hath got me fameI have not stopped mine ears to their demandsnor posted off their suits with slow delaysmy pity hath been balm to heal their woundsmy mildness hath allayed their swelling griefsmy mercy dried their water-flowing tearsI have not been desirous of their wealthnor much oppressed them with great subsidiesnor forward of revenge though they much erredthen why should they love Edward more than meno Exeter these graces challenge graceand when the lion fawns upon the lambthe lamb will never cease to follow himhark hark my lord what shouts are theseseize on the shame-faced Henry bear him henceand once again proclaim us king of Englandyou are the fount that makes small brooks to flownow stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dryand swell so much the higher by their ebbhence with him to the Tower let him not speakand lords towards Coventry bend we our coursewhere peremptory Warwick now remainsthe sun shines hot and if we use delaycold biting winter mars our hoped-for hayaway betimes before his forces joinand take the great-grown traitor unawaresbrave warriors march amain towards Coventrywhere is the post that came from valiant Oxfordhow far hence is thy lord mine honest fellowby this at Dunsmore marching hitherwardhow far off is our brother Montaguewhere is the post that came from Montagueby this at Daintry with a puissant troopsay Somerville what says my loving sonand by thy guess how nigh is Clarence nowat Southam I did leave him with his forcesand do expect him here some two hours hencethen Clarence is at hand I hear his drumit is not his my lord here Southam liesthe drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwickwho should that be belike unlooked for friendsthey are at hand and you shall quickly knowgo trumpet to the walls and sound a parlesee how the surly Warwick mans the wallO unbid spite is sportful Edward comewhere slept our scouts or how are they seducedthat we could hear no news of his repairnow Warwick wilt thou ope the ty gatesspeak gentle words and humbly bend thy kneecall Edward king and at his hands beg mercyand he shall pardon thee these outragesnay rather wilt thou draw thy forces henceconfess who set thee up and plucked thee downcall Warwick patron and be penitentand thou shalt still remain the duke of YorkI thought at least he would have said the kingor did he make the jest against his willis not a dukedom sir a goodly giftay by my faith for a poor earl to giveiull do thee service for so good a giftitwas I that gave the kingdom to thy brotherwhy then itis mine if but by Warwicks giftthou art no Atlas for so great a weightand weakling Warwick takes his gift againand Henry is my king Warwick his subjectbut Warwicks king is Edwards prisonerand gallant Warwick do but answer thiswhat is the body when the head is offalas that Warwick had no more forecastbut whiles he thought to steal the single tenthe king was slily fingered from the deckyou left poor Henry at the bishops palaceand ten to one youll meet him in the Toweritis even so yet you are Warwick stillcome Warwick take the time kneel down kneel downnay when strike now or else the iron coolsI had rather chop this hand off at a blowand with the other fling it at thy facethan bear so low a sail to strike to theesail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friendthis hand fast wound about thy coal-black hairshall whiles thy head is warm and new cut offwrite in the dust this sentence with thy bloodwind-changing Warwick now can change no more O cheerful colours see where Oxford comesoxford Oxford for Lancasterthe gates are open let usenter tooso other foes may set upon our backsstand we in good array for they no doubtwill issue out again and bid us battleif not the ty being but of small defencewell quickly rouse the traitors in the sameO welcome Oxford for we want thy helpmontague Montague for Lancasterthou and thy brother both shall buy this treasoneven with the dearest blood your bodies bearthe harder matched the greater victorymy mind presageth happy gain and conquestsomerset Somerset for Lancastertwo of thy name both dukes of Somersethave sold their lives unto the house of Yorkand thou shalt be the third if this sword holdand lo where George of Clarence sweeps alongof force enough to bid his brother battlewith whom an upright zeal to right prevailsmore than the nature of a brothers lovecome Clarence come thou wilt if Warwick callfather of Warwick know you what this meanslook here I throw my infamy at theeI will not ruinate my fathers housewho gave his blood to lime the stones togetherand set up Lancaster why trowest thou Warwickthat Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnaturalto bend the fatal instruments of waragainst his brother and his lawful kingperhaps thou wilt object my holy oathto keep that oath were more impietythan Jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughterI am so sorry for my trespass madethat to deserve well at my brothers handsI here proclaim myself thy mortal foewith resolution wheresoeer I meet theeas I will meet thee if thou stir abroadto plague thee for thy foul misleading meand so proud-hearted Warwick I defy theeand to my brother turn my blushing cheekspardon me Edward I will make amendsand Richard do not frown upon my faultsfor I will henceforth be no more unconstantnow welcome more and ten times more belovedthan if thou never hadst deserved our hatewelcome good Clarence this is brother-likeO passing traitor perjured and unjustwhat Warwick wilt thou leave the town and fightor shall we beat the stones about thine earsalas I am not cooped here for defenceI will away towards Barnet presentlyand bid thee battle Edward if thou darestyes Warwick Edward dares and leads the waylords to the field Saint George and victoryso lie thou there die thou and die our fearfor Warwick was a bug that feared us allnow Montague sit fast I seek for theethat Warwicks bones may keep thine companyah who is nigh come to me friend or foeand tell me who is victor York or Warwickwhy ask I that my mangled body showsmy blood my want of strength my sick heart showsthat I must yield my body to the earthand by my fall the conquest to my foethus yields the cedar to the axes edgewhose arms gave shelter to the princely eagleunder whose shade the ramping lion sleptwhose top branch overpeered Joves spreading treeand kept low shrubs from winters powerful windthese eyes that now are dimmed with deaths black veilhave been as pierng as the mid-day sunto search the secret treasons of the worldthe wrinkles in my brows now filled with bloodwere likened oft to kingly sepulchresfor who lived king but I could dig his graveand who durst smile when Warwick bent his browlo now my glory smeared in dust and bloodmy parks my walks my manors that I hadeven now forsake me and of all my landsis nothing left me but my bodys lengthwhy what is pomp rule reign but earth and dustand live we how we can yet die we mustah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we arewe might recover all our loss againthe queen from France hath brought a puissant powereven now we heard the news ah couldst thou flywhy then I would not fly ah Montagueif thou be there sweet brother take my handand with thy lips keep in my soul awhilethou lovest me not for brother if thou didstthy tears would wash this cold congealed bloodthat glues my lips and will not let me speakcome quickly Montague or I am deadah Warwick Montague hath breathed his lastand to the latest gasp cried out for Warwickand said commend me to my valiant brother and more he would have said and more he spokewhich sounded like a clamour in a vaultthat mought not be distinguished but at lastI well might hear delivered with a groanO farewell Warwick sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselvesfor Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heavenaway away to meet the queens great powerthus far our fortune keeps an upward courseand we are graced with wreaths of victorybut in the midst of this bright-shining dayI spy a black suspious threatning cloudthat will encounter with our glorious sunere he attain his easeful western bedI mean my lords those powers that the queenhath raised in gallia have arrived our coastand as we hear march on to fight with usa little gale will soon disperse that cloudand blow it to the source from whence it camethy very beams will dry those vapours upfor every cloud engenders not a stormthe queen is valued thirty thousand strongand Somerset with Oxford fled to herif she have time to breathe be well assuredher faction will be full as strong as ourswe are advertised by our loving friendsthat they do hold their course toward Tewksburywe having now the best at Barnet fieldwill thither straight for willingness rids wayand as we march our strength will be augmentedin every county as we go alongstrike up the drum cry courage and awaygreat lords wise men neer sit and wail their lossbut cheerly seek how to redress their harmswhat though the mast be now blown over-boardthe cable broke the holding anchor lostand half our sailors swallowed in the floodyet lives our pilot still isit meet that heshould leave the helm and like a fearful ladwith tearful eyes add water to the seaand give more strength to that which hath too muchwhiles in his moan the ship splits on the rockwhich industry and courage might have savedah what a shame ah what a fault were thissay Warwick was our anchor what of thatand Montague our top-mast what of himour slaughtered friends the tackles what of thesewhy is not Oxford here another anchorand Somerset another goodly mastthe friends of France our shrouds and tacklingsand though unskilful why not Ned and Ifor once allowed the skilful pilots chargewe will not from the helm to sit and weepbut keep our course though the rough wind say nofrom shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrackas good to chide the waves as speak them fairand what is Edward but a ruthless seawhat Clarence but a quicksand of deceitand Richard but a ragged fatal rockall those the enemies to our poor barksay you can swim alas itis but a whiletread on the sand why there you quickly sinkbestride the rock the tide will wash you offor else you famish thats a threefold deaththis speak I lords to let you understandin case some one of you would fly from usthat theres no hoped-for mercy with the brothersmore than with ruthless waves with sands and rockswhy courage then what cannot be avoideditwere childish weakness to lament or fearmethinks a woman of this valiant spiritshould if a coward heard her speak these wordsinfuse his breast with magnanimityand make him naked foil a man at armsI speak not this as doubting any herefor did I but suspect a fearful manhe should have leave to go away betimeslest in our need he might infect anotherand make him of like spirit to himselfif any such be here as God forbidlet him depart before we need his helpwomen and children of so high a courageand warriors faint why itwere perpetual shameO brave young prince thy famous grandfatherdoth live again in thee long mayst thou liveto bear his image and renew his gloriesand he that will not fight for such a hopego home to bed and like the owl by dayif he arise be mocked and wondered atthanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanksand take his thanks that yet hath nothing elseprepare you lords for Edward is at handready to fight therefore be resoluteI thought no less it is his policyto haste thus fast to find us unprovidedbut hes deceived we are in readinessthis cheers my heart to see your forwardnesshere pitch our battle hence we will not budgebrave followers yonder stands the thorny woodwhich by the heavens assistance and your strengthmust by the roots be hewn up yet ere nightI need not add more fuel to your firefor well I wot ye blaze to burn them outgive signal to the fight and to it lordslords knights and gentlemen what I should saymy tears gainsay for every word I speakye see I drink the water of mine eyestherefore no more but this Henry your sovereignis prisoner to the foe his state usurpedhis realm a slaughter house his subjects slainhis statutes cancelled and his treasure spentand yonder is the wolf that makes this spoilyou fight in justice then in Gods name lordsbe valiant and give signal to the fightnow here a period of tumultuous broilsaway with Oxford to Hames Castle straightfor Somerset off with his guilty headgo bear them hence I will not hear them speakfor my part iull not trouble thee with wordsnor I but stoop with patience to my fortuneso part we sadly in this troublous worldto meet with joy in sweet Jerusalemis proclamation made that who finds Edwardshall have a high reward and he his lifeit is and lo where youthful Edward comesbring forth the gallant let us hear him speakwhat can so young a thorn begin to prickedward what satisfaction canst thou makefor bearing arms for stirring up my subjectsand all the trouble thou hast turned me tospeak like a subject proud ambitious Yorksuppose that I am now my fathers mouthresign thy chair and where I stand kneel thouwhilst I propose the self-same words to theewhich traitor thou wouldst have me answer toah that thy father had been so resolvedthat you might still have worn the petticoatand neer have stoln the breech from Lancasterletsop fable in a winters nighthis currish riddles sort not with this placeby heaven brat iull plague you for that worday thou wast born to be a plague to menfor Gods sake take away this captive scoldnay take away this scolding crookback ratherpeace wilful boy or I will charm your tongueuntutored lad thou art too malapertI know my duty you are all undutifullasvious Edward and thou perjured Georgeand thou mis-shapen Dick I tell ye allI am your better traitors as ye areand thou usurpest my fathers right and minetake that the likeness of this railer heresprawlest thou take that to end thy agonyand theres for twitting me with perjuryO kill me toomarry and shallhold Richard hold for we have done too muchwhy should she live to fill the world with wordswhat doth she swoon use means for her recoveryclarence excuse me to the king my brotheriull hence to London on a serious matterere ye come there be sure to hear some newswhat whatthe Tower the TowerO Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boycanst thou not speak O traitors murderersthey that stabbed Ceasar shed no blood at alldid not offend nor were not worthy blameif this foul deed were by to equal ithe was a man this in respect a childand men neer spend their fury on a childwhats worse than murderer that I may name itno no my heart will burst an if I speakand I will speak that so my heart may burstbutchers and villains bloody cannibalshow sweet a plant have you untimely croppedyou have no children butchers if you hadthe thought of them would have stirred up remorsebut if you ever chance to have a childlook in his youth to have him so cut offas deathsmen you have rid this sweet young princeaway with her go bear her hence perforcenay never bear me hence dispatch me herehere sheathe thy sword iull pardon thee my deathwhat wilt thou not then Clarence do it thouby heaven I will not do thee so much easegood Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do itdidst thou not hear me swear I would not do itay but thou usest to forswear thyselfitwas sin before but now itis charitywhat wilt thou not where

to you and yours as to this princewheres Richard goneto London all in post and as I guessto make a bloody supper in the Towerhes sudden if a thing comes in his headnow march we hence discharge the common sortwith pay and thanks and lets away to Londonand see our gentle queen how well she faresby this I hope she hath a son for megood day my lord what at your book so harday my good lord my lord I should say ratheritis sin to flatter good was little bettergood Gloucester and good devil were alikeand both preposterous therefore not good lord sirrah leave us to ourselves we must conferso flies the reckless shepherd from the wolfso first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleeceand next his throat unto the butchers knifewhat scene of death hath Rosus now to actsuspion always haunts the guilty mindthe thief doth fear each bush an officerthe bird that hath been limed in a bushwith trembling wings misdoubteth every bushand I the hapless male to one sweet birdhave now the fatal object in my eyewhere my poor young was limed was caught and killedwhy what a peevish fool was that of Cretethat taught his son the office of a fowland yet for all his wings the fool was drownedI dedalus my poor boy Icarusthy father Minos that denied our coursethe sun that seared the wings of my sweet boythy brother Edward and thyself the seawhose envious gulf did swallow up his lifeah kill me with thy weapon not with wordsmy breast can better brook thy daggers pointthan can my ears that tragic historybut wherefore dost thou come isit for my lifethinkest thou I am an executionera persecutor I am sure thou artif murdring innocents be executingwhy then thou art an executionerthy son I killed for his presumptionhadst thou been killed when first thou didst presumethou hadst not lived to kill a son of mineand thus I prophesy that many a thousandwhich now mistrust no parcel of my fearand many an old mans sigh and many a widowsand many an orphans water-standing eyemen for their sons wives for their husbandsand orphans for their parents timeless deathshall rue the hour that ever thou wast bornthe owl shrieked at thy birth an evil signthe night-crow cried aboding luckless timedogs howled and hideous tempest shook down treesthe raven rooked her on the chimneys topand chattering pies in dismal discords sungthy mother felt more than a mothers painand yet brought forth less than a mothers hopeto wit an indigest deformed lumpnot like the fruit of such a goodly treeteeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast bornto signify thou camest to bite the worldand if the rest be true which I have heardthou camestiull hear no more die prophet in thy speechfor this amongst the rest was I ordaineday and for much more slaughter after thisO God forgive my sins and pardon theewhat will the aspiring blood of Lancastersink in the ground I thought it would have mountedsee how my sword weeps for the poor kings deathO may such purple tears be always shedfrom those that wish the downfall of our houseif any spark of life be yet remainingdown down to hell and say I sent thee thitherI that have neither pity love nor fearindeed itis true that Henry told me offor I have often heard my mother sayI came into the world with my legs forwardhad I not reason think ye to make hasteand seek their ruin that usurped our rightthe midwife wondered and the women criedO Jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so I was which plainly signifiedthat I should snarl and bite and play the dogthen since the heavens have shaped my body solet hell make crooked my mind to answer itI have no brother I am like no brotherand this word love which greybeards call divinebe resident in men like one anotherand not in me I am myself aloneclarence beware thou keepest me from the lightbut I will sort a pitchy day for theefor I will buzz abroad such propheesthat Edward shall be fearful of his lifeand then to purge his fear iull be thy deathking Henry and the prince his son are goneclarence thy turn is next and then the restcounting myself but bad till I be bestiull throw thy body in another roomand triumph Henry in thy day of doomonce more we sit in Englands royal thronere-purchased with the blood of enemieswhat valiant foemen like to autumns cornhave we mowed down in tops of all their pridethree dukes of Somerset threefold renownedfor hardy and undoubted championstwo Cliffords as the father and the sonand two northumberlands two braver menneer spurred their coursers at the trumpets soundwith them the two brave bears Warwick and Montaguethat in their chains fettered the kingly lionand made the forest tremble when they roaredthus have we swept suspion from our seatand made our footstool of securitycome hither Bess and let me kiss my boyyoung Ned for thee thine uncles and myselfhave in our armours watched the winters nightwent all a-foot in summers scalding heatthat thou mightest repossess the crown in peaceand of our labours thou shalt reap the gainiull blast his harvest if your head were laidfor yet I am not looked on in the worldthis shoulder was ordained so thick to heaveand heave it shall some weight or break my backwork thou the way and thou shalt executeclarence and Gloucester love my lovely queenand kiss your princely nephew brothers boththe duty that I owe unto your majestyI seal upon the lips of this sweet babethanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanksand that I love the tree from whence thou sprangestwitness the loving kiss I give the fruitto say the truth so Judas kissed his masterand cried all hail when as he meant all harmnow am I seated as my soul delightshaving my countrys peace and brothers loveswhat will your grace have done with Margaretreignier her father to the king of Francehath pawned the Sils and Jerusalemand hither have they sent it for her ransomaway with her and waft her hence to Franceand now what rests but that we spend the timewith stately triumphs mirthful comic showssuch as befit the pleasure of the courtsound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoyfor here I hope begins our lasting joyold John of gaunt time-honoured Lancasterhast thou according to thy oath and bandbrought hither Henry Hereford thy bold sonhere to make good the boisterous late appealwhich then our leisure would not let us hearagainst the duke of norfolk Thomas MowbrayI have my liegetell me moreover hast thou sounded himif he appeal the duke on anent maliceor worthily as a good subject shouldon some known ground of treachery in himas near as I could sift him on that argumenton some apparent danger seen in himaimed at your highness no inveterate malicethen call them to our presence face to faceand frowning brow to brow ourselves will hearthe accuser and the accused freely speakhigh-stomached are they both and full of irein rage deaf as the sea hasty as firemany years of happy days befallmy gracious sovereign my most loving liegeeach day still better others happinessuntil the heavens envying earths good hapadd an immortal title to your crownwe thank you both yet one but flatters usas well appeareth by the cause you comenamely to appeal each other of high treasoncousin of Hereford what dost thou objectagainst the duke of norfolk Thomas Mowbrayfirst heaven be the record to my speechin the devotion of a subjects lovetendering the precious safety of my princeand free from other misbegotten hatecome I appellant to this princely presencenow Thomas Mowbray do I turn to theeand mark my greeting well for what I speakmy body shall make good upon this earthor my divine soul answer it in heaventhou art a traitor and a miscreanttoo good to be so and too bad to livesince the more fair and crystal is the skythe uglier seem the clouds that in it flyonce more the more to aggravate the notewith a foul traitors name stuff I thy throatand wish so please my sovereign ere I movewhat my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may provelet not my cold words here accuse my zealitis not the trial of a womans warthe bitter clamour of two eager tonguescan arbitrate this cause betwixt us twainthe blood is hot that must be cooled for thisyet can I not of such tame patience boastas to be hushed and nought at all to sayfirst the fair reverence of your highness curbs mefrom giving reins and spurs to my free speechwhich else would post until it had returnedthese terms of treason doubled down his throatsetting aside his high bloods royaltyand let him be no kinsman to my liegeI do defy him and I spit at himcall him a slanderous coward and a villainwhich to maintain I would allow him oddsand meet him were I tied to run afooteven to the frozen ridges of the Alpsor any other ground inhabitablewherever Englishman durst set his footmeantime let this defend my loyaltyby all my hopes most falsely doth he liepale trembling coward there I throw my gagedisclaiming here the kindred of the kingand lay aside my high bloods royaltywhich fear not reverence makes thee to exceptif guilty dread have left thee so much strengthas to take up mine honours pawn then stoopby that and all the rites of knighthood elsewill I make good against thee arm to armwhat I have spoke or thou canst worse deviseI take it up and by that sword I swearwhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulderiull answer thee in any fair degreeor chivalrous design of knightly trialand when I mount alive may I not lightif I be traitor or unjustly fightwhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays chargeit must be great that can inherit usso much as of a thought of ill in himlook what I speak my life shall prove it truethat Mowbray hath received eight thousand noblesin name of lendings for your highness soldiersthe which he hath detained for lewd employmentslike a false traitor and injurious villainbesides I say and will in battle proveor here or elsewhere to the furthest vergethat ever was surveyed by English eyethat all the treasons for these eighteen yearscomplotted and contrived in this landfetch from false Mowbray their first head and springfurther I say and further will maintainupon his bad life to make all this goodthat he did plot the duke of Gloucesters deathsuggest his soon believing adversariesand consequently like a traitor cowardsluiced out his innocent soul through streams of bloodwhich blood like sacrifing Abels crieseven from the tongueless caverns of the earthto me for justice and rough chastisementand by the glorious worth of my descentthis arm shall do it or this life be spenthow high a pitch his resolution soarsthomas of norfolk what sayst thou to thisO let my sovereign turn away his faceand bid his ears a little while be deaftill I have told this slander of his bloodhow God and good men hate so foul a liarmowbray impartial are our eyes and earswere he my brother nay my kingdoms heiras he is but my fathers brothers sonnow by my sceptres awe I make a vowsuch neighbour nearness to our sacred bloodshould nothing privilege him nor partializethe unstooping firmness of my upright soulhe is our subject Mowbray so art thoufree speech and fearless I to thee allowthen Bolingbroke as low as to thy heartthrough the false passage of thy throat thou liestthree parts of that receipt I had for Calaisdisbursed I duly to his highness soldiersthe other part reserved I by consentfor that my sovereign liege was in my debtupon remainder of a dear accountsince last I went to France to fetch his queennow swallow down that lie for Gloucesters deathI slew him not but to mine own disgraceneglected my sworn duty in that casefor you my noble lord of Lancasterthe honourable father to my foeonce did I lay an ambush for your lifea trespass that doth vex my grieved soulbut ere I last received the sacramentI did confess it and exactly beggedyour graces pardon and I hope I had itthis is my fault as for the rest appealedit issues from the rancour of a villaina recreant and most degenerate traitorwhich in myself I boldly will defendand interchangeably hurl down my gageupon this overweening traitors footto prove myself a loyal gentlemaneven in the best blood chambered in his bosomin haste whereof most heartily I prayyour highness to assign our trial daywrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by melets purge this choler without letting bloodthis we prescribe though no physiandeep malice makes too deep insionforget forgive conclude and be agreedour doctors say this is no month to bleedgood uncle let this end where it begunwell calm the duke of norfolk you your sonto be a make-peace shall become my agethrow down my son the duke of norfolks gageand norfolk throw down hiswhen Harry whenobedience bids I should not bid againnorfolk throw down we bid there is no bootmyself I throw dread sovereign at thy footmy life thou shalt command but not my shamethe one my duty owes but my fair namedespite of death that lives upon my graveto dark dishonours use thou shalt not haveI am disgraced impeached and baffled herepierced to the soul with slanders venomed spearthe which no balm can cure but his heart-bloodwhich breathed this poisonrage must be withstoodgive me his gage lions make leopards tameyea but not change his spots take but my shameand I resign my gage my dear dear lordthe purest treasure mortal times affordis spotless reputation that awaymen are but gilded loam or painted claya jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chestis a bold spirit in a loyal breastmine honour is my life both grow in onetake honour from me and my life is donethen dear my liege mine honour let me tryin that I live and for that will I diecousin throw down your gage do you beginO God defend my soul from such deep sinshall I seem crest falln in my fathers sightor with pale beggar-fear impeach my heightbefore this out-dared dastard ere my tongueshall wound mine honour with such feeble wrongor sound so base a parle my teeth shall tearthe slavish motive of recanting fearand spit it bleeding in his high disgracewhere shame doth harbour even in Mowbrays facewe were not born to sue but to commandwhich since we cannot do to make you friendsbe ready as your lives shall answer itat Coventry upon Saint Lamberts daythere shall your swords and lances arbitratethe swelling difference of your settled hatesince we cannot atone you we shall seejustice design the victors chivalrymarshal command our officers-at-armsbe ready to direct these home alarmsalas the part I had in woodstocks blooddoth more solit me than your exclaimsto stir against the butchers of his lifebut since correction lieth in those handswhich made the fault that we cannot correctput we our quarrel to the will of heavenwho when they see the hours ripe on earthwill rain hot vengeance on offenders headsfinds brotherhood in thee no sharper spurhath love in thy old blood no living fireedwards seven sons whereof thyself art onewere as seven vials of his sacred bloodor seven fair branches springing from one rootsome of those seven are dried by natures coursesome of those branches by the Destinies cutbut Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucesterone vial full of Edwards sacred bloodone flourishing branch of his most royal rootis cracked and all the precious liquor spiltis hacked down and his summer leaves all vadedby envys hand and murders bloody axeah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that wombthat metal that self-mould that fashioned theemade him a man and though thou livest and breathestyet art thou slain in him thou dost consentin some large measure to thy fathers deathin that thou seest thy wretched brother diewho was the model of thy fathers lifecall it not patience gaunt it is despairin suffering thus thy brother to be slaughteredthou showest the naked pathway to thy lifeteaching stern murder how to butcher theethat which in mean men we entitle patienceis pale cold cowardice in noble breastswhat shall I say to safeguard thine own lifethe best way is to venge my Gloucesters deathgods is the quarrel for Gods substitutehis deputy anointed in his sighthath caused his death the which if wrongfullylet heaven revenge for I may never liftan angry arm against his ministerwhere then alas may I complain myselfto God the widows champion and defencewhy then I will farewell old gauntthou goest to Coventry there to beholdour cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fightO sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spearthat it may enter butcher Mowbrays breastor if misfortune miss the first careerbe Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosomthat they may break his foaming coursers backand throw the rider headlong in the listsa caitiff recreant to my cousin Herefordfarewell old gaunt thy sometimes brothers wifewith her companion grief must end her lifesister farewell I must to Coventryas much good stay with thee as go with meyet one word more Grief boundeth where it fallsnot with the empty hollowness but weightI take my leave before I have begunfor sorrow ends not when it seemeth donecommend me to my brother Edmund Yorklo this is all nay yet depart not sothough this be all do not so quickly goI shall remember more Bid him ah whatwith all good speed at Plashy visit mealack and what shall good old York there seebut empty lodgings and unfurnished wallsunpeopled offices untrodden stonesand what hear there for welcome but my groanstherefore commend me let him not come thereto seek out sorrow that dwells every wheredesolate desolate will I hence and diethe last leave of thee takes my weeping eyemy lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford armedyea at all points and longs to enter inthe duke of norfolk sprightfully and boldstays but the summons of the appellants

revenge thee deadO let no noble eye profane a tearfor me if I be gored with Mowbrays spearas confident as is the falcons flightagainst a bird do I with Mowbray fightmy loving lord I take my leave of youof you my noble cousin lord Aumerlenot sick although I have to do with deathbut lusty young and cheerly drawing breathlo as at English feasts so I regreetthe daintiest last to make the end most sweetO thou the earthly author of my bloodwhose youthful spirit in me regeneratedoth with a two-fold vigour lift me upto reach at victory above my headadd proof unto mine armour with thy prayersand with thy blessings steel my lances pointthat it may enter Mowbrays waxen coatand furbish new the name of John a gaunteven in the lusty haviour of his songod in thy good cause make thee

livemine innocency and Saint George to thrivehowever God or fortune cast my lotthere lives or dies true to king Richards thronea loyal just and upright gentlemannever did captive with a freer heartcast off his chains of bondage and embracehis golden uncontrolled enfranchisementmore than my danng soul doth celebratethis feast of battle with mine adversarymost mighty liege and my companion peerstake from my mouth the wish of happy yearsas gentle and as jocund as to jestgo I to fight truth has a quiet breastfarewell my lord securely I espyvirtue with valour couched in thine eyeorder the trial marshal and beginharry of Hereford Lancaster and Derbyreceive thy lance and God defend the rightstrong as a tower in hope I cry amen go bear this lance to Thomas duke of norfolkharry of Hereford Lancaster and Derbystands here for God his sovereign and himselfon pain to be found false and recreantto prove the duke of norfolk Thomas Mowbraya traitor to his God his king and himand dares him to set forward to the fighthere standeth Thomas Mowbray duke of norfolkon pain to be found false and recreantboth to defend himself and to approvehenry of Hereford Lancaster and Derbyto God his sovereign and to him disloyalcourageously and with a free desireattending but the signal to beginsound trumpets and set forward combatantsstay stay the king hath thrown his warderdownlet them lay by their helmets and their spearsand both return back to their chairs againwithdraw with us and let the trumpets soundwhile we return these dukes what we decreedraw nearand list what with our counselwe have donefor that our kingdoms earth should not be soiledwith that dear blood which it hath fosteredand for our eyes do hate the dire aspectof vile wounds ploughed up with neighbours swordsand for we think the eagle-winged prideof sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughtswith rival-hating envy set on youto wake our peace which in our countrys cradledraws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleepwhich so roused up with boistrous untuned drumswith harsh-resounding trumpets dreadful brayand grating shock of wrathful iron armsmight from our quiet confines fright fair peaceand make us wade even in our kindreds bloodtherefore we banish you our territoriesyou cousin Hereford upon pain of lifetill twice five summers have enriched our fieldsshall not regreet our fair dominionsbut tread the stranger paths of banishmentyour will be done this must my comfort bethat sun that warms you here shall shine on meand those his golden beams to you here lentshall point on me and gild my banishmentnorfolk for thee remains a heavier doomwhich I with some unwillingness pronouncethe sly slow hours shall not determinatethe dateless limit of thy dear exilethe hopeless word of never to returnbreathe I against thee upon pain of lifea heavy sentence my most sovereign liegeand all unlooked for from your highness moutha dearer merit not so deep a maimas to be cast forth in the common airhave I deserved at your highness handsthe language I have learned these forty yearsmy native English now I must foregoand now my tongues use is to me no morethan an unstringed viol or a harpor like a cunning instrument cased upor being open put into his handsthat knows no touch to tune the harmonywithin my mouth you have engaoled my tonguedoubly portcullised with my teeth and lipsand dull unfeeling barren ignoranceis made my gaoler to attend on meI am too old to fawn upon a nursetoo far in years to be a pupil nowwhat is thy sentence then but speechless deathwhich robs my tongue from breathing native breathit boots thee not to be compassionateafter our sentence plaining comes too latethen thus I turn me from my countrys lightto dwell in solemn shades of endless nightreturn again and take an oath with theelay on our royal sword your banished handsswear by the duty that you owe to Godour part therein we banish with yourselvesto keep the oath that we administeryou never shall so help you truth and Godembrace each others love in banishmentnor never look upon each others facenor never write regreet nor reconlethis lowring tempest of your home-bred hatenor never by advised purpose meetto plot contrive or complot any illgainst us our state our subjects or our landI swearand I to keep all thisnorfolk so far as to mine enemyby this time had the king permitted usone of our souls had wandered in the airbanished this frail sepulchre of our fleshas now our flesh is banished from this landconfess thy treasons ere thou fly the realmsince thou hast far to go bear not alongthe clogging burden of a guilty soulno Bolingbroke if ever I were traitormy name be blotted from the book of lifeand I from heaven banished as from hencebut what thou art God thou and I do knowand all too soon I fear the king shall ruefarewell my liege now no way can I straysave back to England all the worlds my wayuncle even in the glasses of thine eyesI see thy grieved heart thy sad aspecthath from the number of his banished yearsplucked four awaysix frozen winters spentreturn with welcome home from banishmenthow long a time lies in one little wordfour lagging winters and four wanton springsend in a word such is the breath of kingsI thank my liege that in regard of mehe shortens four years of my sons exilebut little vantage shall I reap therebyfor ere the six years that he hath to spendcan change their moons and bring their times aboutmy oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted lightshall be extinct with age and endless nightmy inch of taper will be burnt and doneand blindfold death not let me see my sonwhy uncle thou hast many years to livebut not a minute king that thou canst giveshorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrowand pluck nights from me but not lend a morrowthou canst help time to furrow me with agebut stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimagethy word is current with him for my deathbut dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breaththy son is banished upon good advicewhereto thy tongue a party-verdict gavewhy at our justice seemest thou then to lowerthings sweet to taste prove in digestion souryou urged me as a judge but I had ratheryou would have bid me argue like a fatherO had it been a stranger not my childto smooth his fault I should have been more milda partial slander sought I to avoidand in the sentence my own life destroyedalas I looked when some of you should sayI was too strict to make mine own awaybut you gave leave to my unwilling tongueagainst my will to do myself this wrongcousin farewell and uncle bid him sosix years we banish him and he shall gocousin farewell what presence must not knowfrom where you do remain let paper showmy lord no leave take I for I will rideas far as land will let me by your sideO to what purpose dost thou hoard thy wordsthat thou returnest no greeting to thy friendsI have too few to take my leave of youwhen the tongues office should be prodigalto breathe the abundant dolour of the heartthy grief is but thy absence for a timejoy absent grief is present for that timewhat is six winters they are quickly goneto men in joy but grief makes one hour tencall it a travel that thou takest for pleasuremy heart will sigh when I miscall it sowhich finds it an inforced pilgrimagethe sullen passage of thy weary stepsesteem as foil wherein thou art to setthe precious jewel of thy home returnnay rather every tedious stride I makewill but remember me what a deal of worldI wander from the jewels that I lovemust I not serve a long apprenticehoodto foreign passages and in the endhaving my freedom boast of nothing elsebut that I was a journeyman to griefall places that the eye of heaven visitsare to a wise man ports and happy havensteach thy necessity to reason thusthere is no virtue like necessitythink not the king did banish theebut thou the king woe doth the heavier sitwhere it perceives it is but faintly bornego say I sent thee forth to purchase honourand not the king exiled thee or supposedevouring pestilence hangs in our airand thou art flying to a fresher climelook what thy soul holds dear imagine itto lie that way thou goest not whence thou comestsuppose the singing birds musiansthe grass whereon thou treadest the presence strewedthe flowers fair ladies and thy steps no morethan a delightful measure or a dancefor gnarling sorrow hath less power to bitethe man that mocks at it and sets it lightO who can hold a fire in his handby thinking on the frosty Caucasusor cloy the hungry edge of appetiteby bare imagination of a feastor wallow naked in December snowby thinking on fantastic summers heatO no the apprehension of the goodgives but the greater feeling to the worsefell sorrows tooth doth never rankle morethan when it bites but lanceth not the sorecome come my son iull bring thee on thy wayhad I thy youth and cause I would not staythen Englands ground farewell sweet soil adieumy mother and my nurse that bears me yetwhereer I wander boast of this I canthough banished yet a true-born Englishmanwe did observe Cousin Aumerlehow far brought you high Hereford on his wayI brought high Hereford if you call him sobut to the next highway and there I left himand say what store of parting tears were shedfaith none for me except the northeast windwhich then blew bitterly against our facesawaked the sleeping rheum and so by chancedid grace our hollow parting with a tearwhat said our cousin when you parted with himfarewell and for my heart disdained that my tongueshould so profane the word that taught me craftto counterfeit oppression of such griefthat words seemed buried in my sorrows gravemarry would the word farewell have lengthened hoursand added years to his short banishmenthe should have had a volume of farewellsbut since it would not he had none of mehe is our cousin cousin but itis doubtwhen time shall call him home from banishmentwhether our kinsman come to see his friendsourself and Bushy Bagot here and Greenobserved his courtship to the common peoplehow he did seem to dive into their heartswith humble and familiar courtesywhat reverence he did throw away on slaveswooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smilesand patient underbearing of his fortuneas itwere to banish their affects with himoff goes his bonnet to an oyster-wencha brace of draymen bid God speed him welland had the tribute of his supple kneewith thanks my countrymen my loving friends as were our England in reversion hisand he our subjects next degree in hopewell he is gone and with him go these thoughtsnow for the rebels which stand out in Irelandexpedient manage must be made my liegeere further leisure yield them further meansfor their advantage and your highness losswe will ourself in person to this warand for our coffers with too great a courtand liberal largess are grown somewhat lightwe are enforced to farm our royal realmthe revenue whereof shall furnish usfor our affairs in hand if that come shortour substitutes at home shall have blank charterswhereto when they shall know what men are richthey shall subscribe them for large sums of goldand send them after to supply our wantsfor we will make for Ireland presentlybushy what newsold John of gaunt is grievous sick my lordsuddenly taken and hath sent post-hasteto entreat your majesty to visit himwhere lies heat Ely Housenow put it God in his physians mindto help him to his grave immediatelythe lining of his coffers shall make coatsto deck our soldiers for these Irish warscome gentlemen lets all go visit himpray God we may make haste and come too lateamenwill the king come that I may breathe my lastin wholesome counsel to his unstaid youthvex not yourself nor strive not with your breathfor all in vain comes counsel to his earO but they say the tongues of dying menenforce attention like deep harmonywhere words are scarce they are seldom spent in vainfor they breathe truth that breathe their words in painhe that no more must say is listened morethan they whom youth and ease have taught to glosemore are mens ends marked than their lives beforethe setting sun and music at the closeas the last taste of sweets is sweetest lastwrit in remembrance more than things long pastthough Richard my lifes counsel would not hearmy deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his earno it is stopped with other flattering soundsas praises of his state then there are fondlasvious metres to whose venom soundthe open ear of youth doth always listenreport of fashions in proud Italywhose manners still our tardy apish nationlimps after in base imitationwhere doth the world thrust forth a vanityso it be new theres no respect how vilethat is not quickly buzzed into his earsthen all too late comes counsel to be heardwhere will doth mutiny with wits regarddirect not him whose way himself will chooseitis breath thou lackest and that breath wilt thou losemethinks I am a prophet new inspiredand thus expiring do foretell of himhis rash fierce blaze of riot cannot lastfor violent fires soon burn out themselvessmall showers last long but sudden storms are shorthe tires betimes that spurs too fast betimeswith eager feeding food doth choke the feederlight vanity insatiate cormorantconsuming means soon preys upon itselfthis royal throne of kings this sceptered islethis earth of majesty this seat of Marsthis other Eden demi-paradisethis fortress built by nature for herselfagainst infection and the hand of warthis happy breed of men this little worldthis precious stone set in the silver seawhich serves it in the office of a wallor as a moat defensive to a houseagainst the envy of less happier landsthis blessed plot this earth this realm this Englandthis nurse this teeming womb of royal kingsfeared by their breed and famous by their birthrenowned for their deeds as far from homefor christian service and true chivalryas is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewryof the worlds ransom blessed Marys Sonthis land of such dear souls this dear dear landdear for her reputation through the worldis now leased out I die pronounng itlike to a tenement or pelting farmengland bound in with the triumphant seawhose rocky shore beats back the envious siegeof watery Neptune is now bound in with shamewith inky blots and rotten parchment bondsthat England that was wont to conquer othershath made a shameful conquest of itselfah would the scandal vanish with my lifehow happy then were my ensuing deaththe king is come deal mildly with his youthfor young hot colts being raged do rage the morehow fares our noble uncle Lancasterwhat comfort man how isit with aged gauntO how that name befits my compositionold gaunt indeed and gaunt in being oldwithin me grief hath kept a tedious fastand who abstains from meat that is not gauntfor sleeping England long time have I watchedwatching breeds leanness leanness is all gauntthe pleasure that some fathers feed uponis my strict fast I mean my childrens looksand therein fasting hast thou made me gauntgaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a gravewhose hollow womb inherits nought but bonescan sick men play so nicely with their namesno misery makes sport to mock itselfsince thou dost seek to kill my name in meI mock my name great king to flatter theeshould dying men flatter with those that liveno no men living flatter those that diethou now a-dying sayst thou flatterest meO no thou diest though I the sicker beI am in health I breathe and see thee illnow he that made me knows I see thee illill in myself to see and in thee seeing illthy death-bed is no lesser than thy landwherein thou liest in reputation sickand thou too careless patient as thou artcommittest thy anointed body to the cureof those physians that first wounded theea thousand flatterers sit within thy crownwhose compass is no bigger than thy headand yet incaged in so small a vergethe waste is no whit lesser than thy landO had thy grandsire with a prophets eyeseen how his sons son should destroy his sonsfrom forth thy reach he would have laid thy shamedeposing thee before thou wert possessedwhich art possessed now to depose thyselfwhy cousin wert thou regent of the worldit were a shame to let this land by leasebut for thy world enjoying but this landis it not more than shame to shame it solandlord of England art thou now not kingthy state of law is bond-slave to the lawandand thou a lunatic lean-witted foolpresuming on an agues privilegedarest with thy frozen admonitionmake pale our cheek chasing the royal bloodwith fury from his native residencenow by my seats right royal majestywert thou not brother to great Edwards sonthis tongue that runs so roundly in thy headshould run thy head from thy unreverent shouldersO spare me not my brother Edwards sonfor that I was his father Edwards sonthat blood already like the pelicanhast thou tapped out and drunkenly carousedmy brother Gloucester plain well-meaning soulwhom fair befall in heaven mongst happy soulsmay be a precedent and witness goodthat thou respectest not spilling Edwards bloodjoin with the present sickness that I haveand thy unkindness be like crooked ageto crop at once a too-long withered flowerlive in thy shame but die not shame with theethese words hereafter thy tormentors beconvey me to my bed then to my gravelove they to live that love and honour haveand let them die that age and sullens havefor both hast thou and both become the graveI do beseech your majesty impute his wordsto wayward sickliness and age in himhe loves you on my life and holds you dearas Harry duke of Hereford were he hereright you say true as Herefords love so hisas theirs so mine and all be as it ismy liege old gaunt commends him to your majestywhat says henay nothing all is saidhis tongue is now a stringless instrumentwords life and all old Lancaster hath spentbe York the next that must be bankrupt sothough death be poor it ends a mortal woethe ripest fruit first falls and so doth hehis time is spent our pilgrimage must beso much for that now for our Irish warswe must supplant those rough rug-headed kernswhich live like venom where no venom elsebut only they have privilege to liveand for these great affairs do ask some chargetowards our assistance we do seize to usthe plate coin revenues and moveableswhereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessedhow long shall I be patient ah how longshall tender duty make me suffer wrongnot Gloucesters death nor Herefords banishmentnot gaunts rebukes nor Englands private wrongsnor the prevention of poor Bolingbrokeabout his marriage nor my own disgracehave ever made me sour my patient cheekor bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns faceI am the last of noble Edwards sonsof whom thy father prince of Wales was firstin war was never lion raged more fiercein peace was never gentle lamb more mildthan was that young and princely gentlemanhis face thou hast for even so looked heaccomplished with the number of thy hoursbut when he frowned it was against the Frenchand not against his friends his noble handdid win what he did spend and spent not thatwhich his triumphant fathers hand had wonhis hands were guilty of no kindreds bloodbut bloody with the enemies of his kinO Richard York is too far gone with griefor else he never would compare betweenwhy uncle whats the matterO my liegepardon me if you please if not I pleasednot to be pardoned am content withalseek you to seize and gripe into your handsthe royalties and rights of banished Herefordis not gaunt dead and doth not Hereford livewas not gaunt just and is not Harry truedid not the one deserve to have an heiris not his heir a well-deserving sontake Herefords rights away and take from Timehis charters and his customary rightslet not to-morrow then ensue to-daybe not thyself for how art thou a kingbut by fair sequence and successionnow afore God God forbid I say trueif you do wrongfully seize Herefords rightscall in the letters-patent that he hathby his attorneys-general to suehis livery and deny his offered homageyou pluck a thousand dangers on your headyou lose a thousand well-disposed heartsand prick my tender patience to those thoughtswhich honour and allegiance cannot thinkthink what you will we seize into our handshis plate his goods his money and his landsiull not be by the while my liege farewellwhat will ensue hereof theres none can tellbut by bad courses may be understoodthat their events can never fall out goodgo Bushy to the earl of wiltshire straightbid him repair to us to Ely Houseto see this business to-morrow nextwe will for Ireland and itis time I trowand we create in absence of ourselfour uncle York lord governor of Englandfor he is just and always loved us wellcome on our queen to-morrow must we partbe merry for our time of stay is shortwell lords the duke of Lancaster is deadand living too for now his son is dukebarely in title not in revenuerichly in both if justice had her rightmy heart is great but it must break with silenceeret be disburdened with a liberal tonguenay speak thy mind and let him neer speak morethat speaks thy words again to do thee harmtends that thouedst speak to the duke of Herefordif it be so out with it boldly manquick is mine ear to hear of good towards himno good at all that I can do for himunless you call it good to pity himbereft and gelded of his patrimonynow afore God itis shame such wrongs are bornein him a royal prince and many moreof noble blood in this declining landthe king is not himself but basely ledby flatterers and what they will informmerely in hate gainst any of us allthat will the king severely prosecutegainst us our lives our children and our heirsthe commons hath he pilled with grievous taxesand quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he finedfor anent quarrels and quite lost their heartsand daily new exactions are devisedas blanks benevolences and I wot not whatbut what o Gods name doth become of thiswars have not wasted it for warred he hath notbut basely yielded upon compromisethat which his ancestors achieved with blowsmore hath he spent in peace than they in warsthe earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farmthe kings grown bankrupt like a broken manreproach and dissolution hangeth over himhe hath not money for these Irish warshis burdenous taxations notwithstandingbut by the robbing of the banished dukehis noble kinsman most degenerate kingbut lords we hear this fearful tempest singyet seek no shelter to avoid the stormwe see the wind sit sore upon our sailsand yet we strike not but securely perishwe see the very wrack that we must sufferand unavoided is the danger nowfor suffering so the causes of our wracknot so even through the hollow eyes of deathispy life peering but I dare not sayhow near the tidings of our comfort isnay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost oursbe confident to speak northumberlandwe three are but thyself and speaking sothy words are but as thoughts therefore be boldthen thus I have from Port le Blanc a bayin Brittany received intelligencethat Harry duke of Hereford Rainold lord Cobhamthat late broke from the duke of Exeterhis brother Archbishop late of Canterburysir Thomas Erpingham sir John ramstonsir John norbery sir Robert Waterton and Frans Quointall these well furnished by the duke of Britainewith eight tall ships three thousand men of warare making hither with all due expedienceand shortly mean to touch our northern shoreperhaps they had ere this but that they staythe first departing of the king for Irelandif then we shall shake off our slavish yokeimp out our drooping countrys broken wingredeem from broking pawn the blemished crownwipe off the dust that hides our sceptres giltand make high majesty look like itselfaway with me in post to Ravenspurghbut if you faint as fearing to do sostay and be secret and myself will goto horse to horse urge doubts to them that fearhold out my horse and I will first be theremadam your majesty is too much sadyou promised when you parted with the kingto lay aside life-harming heavinessand entertain a cheerful dispositionto please the king I did to please myselfI cannot do it yet I know no causewhy I should welcome such a guest as griefsave bidding farewell to so sweet a guestas my sweet Richard yet again methinkssome unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes wombis coming towards me and my inward soulwith nothing trembles at some thing it grievesmore than with parting from my lord the kingeach substance of a grief hath twenty shadowswhich show like grief itself but are not sofor sorrows eye glazed with blinding tearsdivides one thing entire to many objectslike perspectives which rightly gazed uponshow nothing but confusion eyed awrydistinguish form so your sweet majestylooking awry upon your lords departurefinds shapes of grief more than himself to wailwhich looked on as it is is nought but shadowsof what it is not then thrice-gracious queenmore than your lords departure weep not mores not seenor if it be itis with false sorrows eyewhich for things true weeps things imaginaryit may be so but yet my inward soulpersuades me it is otherwise howeer it beI cannot but be sad so heavy sadas though in thinking on no thought I thinkmakes me with heavy nothing faint and shrinkitis nothing but conceit my gracious ladyitis nothing less conceit is still derivedfrom some forefather grief mine is not sofor nothing hath begot my something griefor something hath the nothing that I grieveitis in reversion that I do possessbut what it is that is not yet known whatI cannot name itis nameless woe I wotgod save your majesty and well met gentlemenI hope the king is not yet shipped for Irelandwhy hopest thou so itis better hope he isfor his designs crave haste his haste good hopethen wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippedthat he our hope might have retired his powerand driven into despair an enemys hopewho strongly hath set footing in this landthe banished Bolingbroke repeals himselfand with uplifted arms is safe arrivedat Ravenspurghnow God in heaven forbidah madam itis too true and that is worsethe lord northumberland his son young Henry Percythe lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughbywith all their powerful friends are fled to himwhy have you not proclaimed northumberlandand all the rest of the revolted faction traitorswe have whereupon the earl of Worcesterhath broke his staff resigned his stewardshipand all the household servants fled with himto Bolingbrokeso Green thou art the midwife to my woeand Bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heirnow hath my soul brought forth her prodigyand I a gasping new-delivered motherhave woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joineddespair not madamwho shall hinder meI will despair and be at enmitywith cozening hope he is a flatterera parasite a keeper-back of deathwho gently would dissolve the bands of lifewhich false hope lingers in extremityhere comes the duke of Yorkwith signs of war about his aged neckO full of careful business are his looksuncle for Gods sake speak comfortable wordsshould I do so I should belie my thoughtscomforts in heaven and we are on the earthwhere nothing lives but crosses cares and griefyour husband he is gone to save far offwhilst others come to make him lose at homehere am I left to underprop his landwho weak with age cannot support myselfnow comes the sick hour that his surfeit madenow shall he try his friends that flattered himmy lord your son was gone before I camehe was why so go all which way it willthe nobles they are fled the commons they are coldand will I fear revolt on Herefords sidesirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucesterbid her send me presently a thousand poundhold take my ringmy lord I had forgot to tell your lordshipto-day as I came by I called therebut I shall grieve you to report the restwhat isit knavean hour before I came the duchess diedgod for his mercy what a tide of woescomes rushing on this woeful land at onceI know not what to do I would to Godso my untruth had not provoked him to itthe king had cut off my head with my brotherswhat are there no posts dispatched for Irelandhow shall we do for money for these warscome sister cousin I would say pray pardon mego fellow get thee home provide some cartsand bring away the armour that is theregentlemen will you go muster men if I knowhow or which way to order these affairsthus thrust disorderly into my handsnever believe me Both are my kinsmenthe one is my sovereign whom both my oathand duty bids defend the other againis my kinsman whom the king hath wrongedwhom consence and my kindred bids to rightwell somewhat we must do come cousiniull dispose of you gentlemen go muster up your menand meet me presently at Berkeley CastleI should to Plashy toobut time will not permit All is unevenand every thing is left at six and seventhe wind sits fair for news to go to Irelandbut none returns for us to levy powerproportionable to the enemyis all unpossiblebesides our nearness to the king in loveis near the hate of those love not the kingand thats the wavering commons for their lovelies in their purses and whoso empties themby so much fills their hearts with deadly hatewherein the king stands generally condemnedif judgment lie in them then so do webecause we ever have been near the kingwell iull for refuge straight to Bristol Castlethe earl of wiltshire is already therethither will I with you for little officewill the hateful commons perform for usexcept like curs to tear us all to pieceswill you go along with usno I will to Ireland to his majestyfarewell if hearts presages be not vainwe three here part that neer shall meet againthats as York thrives to beat back Bolingbrokealas poor duke the task he undertakesis numbering sands and drinking oceans drywhere one on his side fights thousands will flyfarewell at once for once for all and everwell we may meet againI fear me neverhow far is it my lord to Berkeley nowbelieve me noble lordI am a stranger here in Gloucestershirethese high wild hills and rough uneven waysdraw out our miles and make them wearisomebut yet your fair discourse hath been as sugarmaking the hard way sweet and delectablebut I bethink me what a weary wayfrom Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be foundin Ross and Willoughby wanting your companywhich I protest hath very much beguiledthe tediousness and process of my travelbut theirs is sweetened with the hope to havethe present benefit which I possessand hope to joy is little less in joythan hope enjoyed by this the weary lordsshall make their way seem short as mine hath doneby sight of what I have your noble companyof much less value is my companythan your good words but who comes hereit is my son young Harry Percysent from my brother Worcester whencesoeverharry how fares your uncleI had thought my lord to have learned his health of youwhy is he not with the queenno my good lord he hath forsook the courtbroken his staff of office and dispersedthe household of the kingwhat was his reasonhe was not so resolved when last we spake togetherbecause your lordship was proclaimed traitorbut he my lord is gone to Ravenspurghto offer service to the duke of Herefordand sent me over by Berkeley to discoverwhat power the duke of York had levied therethen with direction to repair to Ravenspurghhave you forgot the duke of Hereford boyno my good lord for that is not forgotwhich neer I did remember to my knowledgeI never in my life did look on himthen learn to know him now this is the dukemy gracious lord I tender you my servicesuch as it is being tender raw and youngwhich elder days shall ripen and confirmto more approved service and desertI thank thee gentle Percy and be sureI count myself in nothing else so happyas in a soul remembering my good friendsand as my fortune ripens with thy loveit shall be still thy true loves recompensemy heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals ithow far is it to Berkeley and what stirkeeps good old York there with his men of warthere stands the castle by yon tuft of treesmanned with three hundred men as I have heardand in it are the lords of York Berkeley and Seymournone else of name and noble estimatehere come the lords of Ross and Willoughbybloody with spurring fiery-red with hastewelcome my lords I wot your love pursuesa banished traitor all my treasuryis yet but unfelt thanks which more enrichedshall be your love and labours recompenseyour presence makes us rich most noble lordand far surmounts our labour to attain itevermore thanks the exchequer of the poorwhich till my infant fortune comes to yearsstands for my bounty but who comes hereit is my lord of Berkeley as I guessmy lord of Hereford my message is to youmy lord my answer is to Lancasterand I am come to seek that name in Englandand I must find that title in your tonguebefore I make reply to aught you saymistake me not my lord itis not my meaningto raze one title of your honour outto you my lord I come what lord you willfrom the most gracious regent of this landthe duke of York to know what pricks you onto take advantage of the absent timeand fright our native peace with self-born armsI shall not need transport my words by youhere comes his grace in personmy noble uncleshow me thy humble heart and not thy kneewhose duty is deceivable and falsemy gracious uncletut tutgrace me no grace nor uncle me no uncleI am no traitors uncle and that word gracein an ungracious mouth is but profanewhy have those banished and forbidden legsdared once to touch a dust of Englands groundbut then more why why have they dared to marchso many miles upon her peaceful bosomfrighting her pale-faced villages with warand ostentation of despised armscomest thou because the anointed king is hencewhy foolish boy the king is left behindand in my loyal bosom lies his powerwere I but now the lord of such hot youthas when brave gaunt thy father and myselfrescued the Black prince that young Mars of menfrom forth the ranks of many thousand FrenchO then how quickly should this arm of minenow prisoner to the palsy chastise theeand minister correction to thy faultmy gracious uncle let me know my faulton what condition stands it and whereineven in condition of the worst degreein gross rebellion and detested treasonthou art a banished man and here art comebefore the expiration of thy timein braving arms against thy sovereignas I was banished I was banished Herefordbut as I come I come for Lancasterand noble uncle I beseech your gracelook on my wrongs with an indifferent eyeyou are my father for methinks in youI see old gaunt alive O then my fatherwill you permit that I shall stand condemneda wandering vagabond my rights and royaltiesplucked from my arms perforce and given awayto upstart unthrifts wherefore was I bornif that my cousin king be king of Englandit must be granted I am duke of Lancasteryou have a son Aumerle my noble kinsmanhad you first died and he been thus trod downhe should have found his uncle gaunt a fatherto rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bayI am denied to sue my livery hereand yet my letters-patent give me leavemy fathers goods are all distrained and soldand these and all are all amiss employedwhat would you have me do I am a subjectand challenge law attorneys are denied meand therefore personally I lay my claimto my inheritance of free descentthe noble duke hath been too much abusedit stands your grace upon to do him rightbase men by his endowments are made greatmy lords of England let me tell you thisI have had feeling of my cousins wrongsand laboured all I could to do him rightbut in this kind to come in braving armsbe his own carver and cut out his wayto find out right with wrong it may not beand you that do abet him in this kindcherish rebellion and are rebels allthe noble duke hath sworn his coming isbut for his own and for the right of thatwe all have strongly sworn to give him aidand let him neer see joy that breaks that oathwell well I see the issue of these armsI cannot mend it I must needs confessbecause my power is weak and all ill leftbut if I could by him that gave me lifeI would attach you all and make you stoopunto the sovereign mercy of the kingbut since I cannot be it known to youI do remain as neuter so fare you wellunless you please to enter in the castleand there repose you for this nightan offer uncle that we will acceptbut we must win your grace to go with usto Bristol Castle which they say is heldby Bushy Bagot and their complicesthe caterpillars of the commonwealthwhich I have sworn to weed and pluck awayit may be I will go with you but yet iull pausefor I am loath to break our countrys lawsnor friends nor foes to me welcome you arethings past redress are now with me past caremy lord of Salisbury we have stayed ten daysand hardly kept our countrymen togetherand yet we hear no tidings from the kingtherefore we will disperse ourselves farewellstay yet another day thou trusty Welshmanthe king reposeth all his confidence in theeitis thought the king is dead we will not staythe bay-trees in our country are all witheredand meteors fright the fixed stars of heaventhe pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earthand lean-looked prophets whisper fearful changerich men look sad and ruffians dance and leapthe one in fear to lose what they enjoythe other to enjoy by rage and warthese signs forerun the death or fall of kingsfarewell our countrymen are gone and fledas well assured Richard their king is deadah Richard with the eyes of heavy mindI see thy glory like a shooting starfall to the base earth from the firmamentthy sun sets weeping in the lowly westwitnessing storms to come woe and unrestthy friends are fled to wait upon thy foesand crossly to thy good all fortune goesbring forth these menbushy and Green I will not vex your soulssince presently your souls must part your bodieswith too much urging your pernious livesfor itwere no charity yet to wash your bloodfrom off my hands here in the view of menI will unfold some causes of your deathsyou have misled a prince a royal kinga happy gentleman in blood and lineamentsby you unhappied and disfigured cleanyou have in manner with your sinful hoursmade a divorce betwixt his queen and himbroke the possession of a royal bedand stained the beauty of a fair queens cheekswith tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongsmyself a prince by fortune of my birthnear to the king in blood and near in lovetill you did make him misinterpret mehave stooped my neck under your injuriesand sighed my English breath in foreign cloudseating the bitter bread of banishmentwhilst you have fed upon my signoriesdisparked my parks and felled my forest woodsfrom mine own windows torn my household coatrazed out my impress leaving me no signsave mens opinions and my living bloodto show the world I am a gentlemanthis and much more much more than twice all thiscondemns you to the death See them delivered overto execution and the hand of deathmore welcome is the stroke of death to methan Bolingbroke to England lords farewellmy comfort is that heaven will take our soulsand plague injustice with the pains of hellmy lord northumberland see them dispatcheduncle you say the queen is at your housefor Gods sake fairly let her be entreatedtell her I send to her my kind commendstake speal care my greetings be delivereda gentleman of mine I have dispatchedwith letters of your love to her at largethanks gentle uncle come lords awayto fight with Glendower and his complicesawhile to work and after holidaybarkloughly Castle call they this at handyea my lord how brooks your grace the airafter your late tossing on the breaking seasneeds must I like it well I weep for joyto stand upon my kingdom once againdear earth I do salute thee with my handthough rebels wound thee with their horses hoofsas a long-parted mother with her childplays fondly with her tears and smiles in meetingso weeping smiling greet I thee my earthand do thee favour with my royal handsfeed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earthnor with thy sweets comfort his revenous sensebut let thy spiders that suck up thy venomand heavy-gaited toads lie in their waydoing annoyance to the treacherous feetwhich with usurping steps do trample theeyield stinging nettles to mine enemiesand when they from thy bosom pluck a flowerguard it I pray thee with a lurking adderwhose double tongue may with a mortal touchthrow death upon thy sovereigns enemiesmock not my senseless conjuration lordsthis earth shall have a feeling and these stonesprove armed soldiers ere her native kingshall falter under foul rebellions armsfear not my lord that power that made you kinghath power to keep you king in spite of allthe means that heaven yields must be embracedand not neglected else if heaven wouldand we will not heavens offer we refusethe proffered means of succour and redresshe means my lord that we are too remisswhilst Bolingbroke through our securitygrows strong and great in substance and in friendsdiscomfortable cousin knowest thou notthat when the searching eye of heaven is hidbehind the globe and lights the lower worldthen thieves and robbers range abroad unseenin murders and in outrage bloody herebut when from under this terrestrial ballhe fires the proud tops of the eastern pinesand darts his light through every guilty holethen murders treasons and detested sinsthe cloak of night being plucked from off their backsstand bare and naked trembling at themselvesso when this thief this traitor Bolingbrokewho all this while hath revelled in the nightwhilst we were wandering with the antipodesshall see us rising in our throne the easthis treasons will sit blushing in his facenot able to endure the sight of daybut self-affrighted tremble at his sinnot all the water in the rough rude seacan wash the balm from an anointed kingthe breath of worldly men cannot deposethe deputy elected by the lordfor every man that Bolingbroke hath pressedto lift shrewd steel against our golden crowngod for his Richard hath in heavenly paya glorious angel then if angels fightweak men must fall for heaven still guards the rightwelcome my lord how far off lies your powernor near nor further off my gracious lordthan this weak arm discomfort guides my tongueand bids me speak of nothing but despairone day too late I fear me noble lordhath clouded all thy happy days on earthO call back yesterday bid time returnand thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting mento-day to-day unhappy day too lateoerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy statefor all the Welshmen hearing thou wert deadare gone to Bolingbroke dispersed and fledcomfort my liege why looks your grace so palebut now the blood of twenty thousand mendid triumph in my face and they are fledand till so much blood thither come againhave I not reason to look pale and deadall souls that will be safe fly from my sidefor time hath set a blot upon my pridecomfort my liege remember who you areI had forgot myself Am I not kingawake thou sluggard majesty thou sleepestis not the kings name twenty thousand namesarm arm my name a puny subject strikesat thy great glory look not to the groundye favourites of a king are we not highhigh be our thoughts I know my uncle Yorkhath power enough to serve our turn but who comes heremore health and happiness betide my liegethan can my care-tuned tongue deliver himmine ear is open and my heart preparedthe worst is worldly loss thou canst unfoldsay is my kingdom lost why itwas my careand what loss is it to be rid of carestrives Bolingbroke to be as great as wegreater he shall not be if he serve Godwell serve him too and be his fellow sorevolt our subjects that we cannot mendthey break their faith to God as well as uscry woe destruction ruin loss decaythe worst is death and death will have his dayglad am I that your highness is so armedto bear the tidings of calamitylike an unseasonable stormy daywhich makes the silver rivers drown their shoresas if the world were all dissolved to tearsso high above his limits swells the rageof Bolingbroke covering your fearful landwith hard bright steel and hearts harder than steelwhite-beards have armed their thin and hairless scalpsagainst thy majesty and boys with womens voicesstrive to speak big and clap their female jointsin stiff unwieldy arms against thy crownthy very beadsmen learn to bend their bowsof double-fatal yew against thy stateyea distaff-women manage rusty billsagainst thy seat both young and old rebeland all goes worse than I have power to telltoo well too well thou tellest a tale so illwhere is the earl of wiltshire where is Bagotwhat is become of Bushy where is Greenthat they have let the dangerous enemymeasure our confines with such peaceful stepsif we prevail their heads shall pay for itI warrant they have made peace with Bolingbrokepeace have they made with him indeed my lordO villains vipers damned without redemptiondogs easily won to fawn on any mansnakes in my heart-blood warmed that sting my heartthree Judases each one thrice worse than Judaswould they make peace terrible hell make warupon their spotted souls for this offencesweet love I see changing his propertyturns to the sourest and most deadly hateagain uncurse their souls their peace is madewith heads and not with hands those whom you cursehave felt the worst of deaths destroying woundand lie full low graved in the hollow groundis Bushy Green and the earl of wiltshire deadyea all of them at Bristol lost their headswhere is the duke my father with his powerno matter where of comfort no man speaklets talk of graves of worms and epitaphsmake dust our paper and with rainy eyeswrite sorrow on the bosom of the earthlets choose executors and talk of willsand yet not so for what can we bequeathsave our deposed bodies to the groundour lands our lives and all are Bolingbrokesand nothing can we call our own but deathand that small model of the barren earthwhich serves as paste and cover to our bonesfor Gods sake let us sit upon the groundand tell sad stories of the death of kingshow some have been deposed some slain in warsome haunted by the ghosts they have deposedsome poisoned by their wives some sleeping killedall murdered for within the hollow crownthat rounds the mortal temples of a kingkeeps death his court and there the antick sitsscoffing his state and grinning at his pompallowing him a breath a little sceneto monarchize be feared and kill with looksinfusing him with self and vain conceitas if this flesh which walls about our lifewere brass impregnable and humoured thuscomes at the last and with a little pinbores through his castle wall and farewell kingcover your heads and mock not flesh and bloodwith solemn reverence throw away respecttradition form and ceremonious dutyfor you have but mistook me all this whileI live with bread like you feel wanttaste grief need friends subjected thushow can you say to me I am a kingmy lord wise men neer sit and wail their woesbut presently prevent the ways to wailto fear the foe since fear oppresseth strengthgives in your weakness strength unto your foeand so your follies fight against yourselffear and be slain no worse can come to fightand fight and die is death destroying deathwhere fearing dying pays death servile breathmy father hath a power inquire of himand learn to make a body of a limbthou chidest me well proud Boling broke I cometo change blows with thee for our day of doomthis ague-fit of fear is over-blownan easy task it is to win our ownsay Scroop where lies our uncle with his powerspeak sweetly man although thy looks be sourmen judge by the complexion of the skythe state and inclination of the dayso may you by my dull and heavy eyemy tongue hath but a heavier tale to sayI play the torturer by small and smallto lengthen out the worst that must be spokenyour uncle York is joined with Bolingbrokeand all your northern castles yielded upand all your southern gentlemen in armsupon his partythou hast said enoughbeshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forthof that sweet way I was in to despairwhat say you now what comfort have we nowby heaven iull hate him everlastinglythat bids me be of comfort any morego to Flint Castle there iull pine awaya king woes slave shall kingly woe obeythat power I have discharge and let them goto ear the land that hath some hope to growfor I have none let no man speak againto alter this for counsel is but vainmy liege one wordhe does me double wrongthat wounds me with the flatteries of his tonguedischarge my followers let them hence awayfrom Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair dayso that by this intelligence we learnthe Welshmen are dispersed and Salisburyis gone to meet the king who lately landedwith some few private friends upon this coastthe news is very fair and good my lordrichard not far from hence hath hid his headit would beseem the lord northumberlandto say king Richard alack the heavy daywhen such a sacred king should hide his headyour grace mistakes only to be briefleft I his title outthe time hath beenwould you have been so brief with him he wouldhave been so brief with you to shorten youfor taking so the head your whole heads lengthmistake not uncle further than you shouldtake not good cousin further than you shouldlest you mistake the heavens are oer our headsI know it uncle and oppose not myselfagainst their will but who comes herewelcome Harry what will not this castle yieldthe castle royally is manned my lordagainst thy entranceroyallywhy it contains no kingyes my good lordit doth contain a king king Richard lieswithin the limits of yon lime and stoneand with him are the lord Aumerle lord Salisburysir Stephen Scroop besides a clergymanof holy reverence who I cannot learnO belike it is the Bishop of Carlislenoble lordgo to the rude ribs of that anent castlethrough brazen trumpet send the breath of parleyinto his ruined ears and thus deliverhenry Bolingbrokeon both his knees doth kiss king Richards handand sends allegiance and true faith of heartto his most royal person hither comeeven at his feet to lay my arms and powerprovided that my banishment repealedand lands restored again be freely grantedif not iull use the advantage of my powerand lay the summers dust with showers of bloodrained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmenthe which how far off from the mind of Bolingbrokeit is such crimson tempest should bedrenchthe fresh green lap of fair king Richards landmy stooping duty tenderly shall showgo signify

the blushing discontented sunfrom out the fiery portal of the eastwhen he perceives the envious clouds are bentto dim his glory and to stain the trackof his bright passage to the ocdentyet looks he like a king behold his eyeas bright as is the eagles lightens forthcontrolling majesty alack alack for woethat any harm should stain so fair a showwe are amazed and thus long have we stoodto

grandsires bonesand by the royalties of both your bloodscurrents that spring from one most gracious headand by the buried hand of war-like gauntand by the worth and honour of himselfcomprising all that may be sworn or saidhis coming hither hath no further scopethan for his lineal royalties and to begenfranchisement immediate on his kneeswhich on thy royal party granted oncehis glittering arms he will commend to rusthis barbed steeds to stables and his heartto faithful service of your majestythis swears he as he is a prince is justand as I am a gentleman I credit

almsmans gownmy figured goblets for a dish of woodmy sceptre for a palmers walking-staffmy subjects for a pair of carved saintsand my large kingdom for a little gravea little little grave an

once why not upon my headaumerle thou weepest my tender-hearted cousinwell make foul weather with despised tearsour sighs and they shall lodge the summer cornand make a dearth in this revolting landor shall we play the wantons with our woesand make some pretty match with shedding tearsas thus to drop them still upon one placetill they have fretted us a pair of graveswithin the earth and there inlaid there liestwo kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well I seeI talk but idly and you laugh at memost mighty prince my lord northumberlandwhat

grieftherefore no danng girl some other sportmadam well tell talesof sorrow or of joyof either madamof neither girlfor if of joy being altogether wantingit doth remember me the more of

fast growing spraysthat look too lofty in our commonwealthall must be even in our governmentyou thus employed I will go root awaythe noisome weeds that without profit suckthe soils fertility from wholesome flowerswhy should we in the compass of a palekeep law and form and due proportionshowing as in a model our firm estatewhen our sea-walled garden the whole landis full of weeds her fairest flowers choked upher fruit-trees all unpruned her hedges ruinedher knots disordered and her wholesome herbsswarming with caterpillarshold thy peacehe that hath suffered this disordered springhath now himself met with the fall of leafthe weeds that his broad-spreading leaves did shelterthat seemed in eating him to hold him upare plucked up root and all by BolingbrokeI mean the earl of wiltshire Bushy Greenwhat are they deadthey are and Bolingbrokehath seized the wasteful king O what pity is itthat he hath not so trimmed and dressed his landas we this garden we at time of yeardo wound the bark the skin of our fruit-treeslest being over-proud with sap and bloodwith too much riches it confound itselfhad he done so to great and growing menthey might have lived to bear and he to tastetheir fruits of duty superfluous brancheswe lop away that bearing boughs may livehad he done so himself had borne the crownwhich waste of idle hours hath quite thrown downwhat

thou wretchpardon me madam little joy have Ito breathe these news yet what I say is trueking Richard he is in the mighty holdof Bolingbroke their fortunes both are weighedin your lords scale is nothing but himselfand some few vanities that make him lightbut in the balance of great Bolingbrokebesides himself are all the English peersand with that odds he weighs king Richard downpost you to London and youll find it soI speak no more than every one doth knownimble mischance that art so light of footdoth not thy embassage belong to meand am I last that knows it O thou thinkestto

forth and look upon that manmy lord Aumerle I know your daring tonguescorns to unsay what once it hath deliveredin that dead time when Gloucesters death was plottedI heard you say is not my arm of lengththat reacheth from the restful English courtas far as Calais to my uncles head amongst much other talk that very timeI heard you say that you had rather refusethe offer of a hundred thousand crownsthan Bolingbrokes return to Englandadding withal how blest this land would bein this your cousins deathprinces and noble lordswhat answer shall I make to this base manshall I so much dishonour my fair starson equal terms to give him chastisementeither I must or have mine honour soiledwith the attainder of his slanderous lipsthere is my gage the manual seal of deaththat marks thee out for hell I say thou liestand will maintain what thou hast said is falsein thy heart-blood though being all too baseto stain the temper of my knightly swordbagot forbear thou shalt not take it upexcepting one I would he were the bestin all this presence that hath moved me soif that thy valour stand on sympathiesthere is my gage Aumerle in gage to thineby that fair sun which shows me where thou standestI heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest itthat thou wert cause of noble Gloucesters deathif thou denyest it twenty times thou liestand I will turn thy falsehood to thy heartwhere it was forged with my rapiers pointthou darest not coward live to see that daynow by my soul I would it were this hourfitzwater thou art damned to hell for thisaumerle thou liest

do not may my hands rot offand never brandish more revengeful steelover the glittering helmet of my foeI task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerleand spur thee on with full as many liesas may

answer twenty thousand such as youmy lord fitzwater I do remember wellthe very time Aumerle and you did talkitis very true you were in presence thenand you can witness with me this is trueas false by heaven as heaven itself is truesurrey thou bestdishonourable boythat he shall lie so heavy on my swordthat it shall render vengeance and revengetill thou the lie-giver and that lie do liein earth as quiet as thy fathers skullin proof whereof there is my honours pawnengage it to the trial if thou daresthow fondly dost thou spur a forward horseif I dare eat or drink or breathe or liveI dare meet Surrey in a wildernessand spit upon him whilst I say he liesand lies and lies there is my bond of faithto tie thee to my strong correctionas I intend to thrive in this new worldaumerle is guilty of my true appealbesides I heard the banished norfolk saythat thou Aumerle didst send two of thy mento execute the noble duke at Calaissome honest christian trust me with a gagethat norfolk lies here do I throw down thisif he may be repealed to try his honourthese differences shall all rest under gagetill norfolk be repealed repealed he shall beand though mine enemy

enough noble to be upright judgeof noble Richard then true noblesse wouldlearn him forbearance from so foul a wrongwhat subject can give sentence on his kingand who sits here that is not Richards subjectthieves are not judged but they are by to hearalthough apparent guilt be seen in themand shall the figure of Gods majestyhis captain steward deputy electanointed crowned planted many yearsbe judged by subject and inferior breathand he himself not present O forfend it Godthat in a christian climate souls refinedshould show so heinous black obscene a deedI speak to subjects and a subject speaksstirred up by God thus boldly for his kingmy lord of Hereford here whom you call kingis a foul traitor to proud Herefords kingand if you crown him let me prophesythe blood of English shall manure the groundand future ages groan for this foul actpeace shall go sleep with Turks and infidelsand in this seat of peace tumultuous warsshall kin with kin and kind with kind

an earthy pitgod save king Henry unkinged Richard saysand send him many years of sunshine dayswhat more remainsno more but that you readthese accusations and these grievous crimescommitted by your person and your followersagainst the state and profit of this landthat by confessing them the souls of menmay deem that you are worthily deposedmust I do so and must I ravel outmy weaved-up follies gentle northumberlandif thy offences were upon recordwould it not shame thee in so fair a troopto read a lecture of them if thou wouldstthere shouldst thou find one heinous articlecontaining the deposing of a kingand cracking the strong warrant of an oathmarked with a blot damned in the book of heavennay all of you that stand and look upon mewhilst that my wretchedness doth bait myselfthough some of you with Pilate wash your handsshowing an outward pity yet you Pilateshave here delivered me to my sour crossand water cannot wash away your sinmy lord dispatch read oer these articlesmine eyes are full of tears I cannot seeand yet salt water blinds them not so muchbut they can see a sort of traitors herenay if I turn mine eyes upon myselfI find myself a traitor with the restfor I have given here my souls consentto undeck the pompous body of a kingmade glory base and sovereignty a slaveproud majesty a subject state a peasantmy lordno lord of thine thou haught insulting mannor no mans lord I have no name no titleno not that name was given me at the fontbut itis usurped alack the heavy daythat I have worn so many winters outand

my word be sterling yet in Englandlet it command a mirror hither straightthat it may show me what a face I havesince it is bankrupt of his majestygo some of you and fetch a looking-glassread oer this paper while the glass doth comefiend thou tormentest me ere I come to hellurge it no more my lord northumberlandthe commons will not then be satisfiedthey shall be satisfied iull read enoughwhen I do see the very book indeedwhere all my sins are writ and thats myselfgive me the glass and therein will I readno deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struckso many blows upon this face of mineand made no deeper wounds O flattering glasslike to my followers in prosperitythou dost beguile me was this face the facethat every day under his household roofdid keep ten thousand men was this the facethat like the sun did make beholders winkwas this the face that faced so many folliesand was at last out-faced by Bolingbrokea brittle glory shineth in this faceas brittle as the glory is the facefor there it is cracked in a hundred shiversmark silent king the moral of this sporthow soon my sorrow hath destroyed my facethe shadow of your sorrow hath destroyedthe shadow of your facesay that againthe shadow of my sorrow Ha lets seeitis very true my grief lies all withinand these external manners of lamentsare merely shadows to the unseen griefthat swells with silence in the tortured soulthere lies the substance and I thank thee kingfor thy great bounty that not only givestme cause to wail but teachest me the wayhow to lament the cause iull beg one boonand then be gone and trouble you no moreshall I obtain itname it fair cousinfair cousin I am greater than a kingfor when I was a king my flattererswere then but subjects being now a subjectI have a king here to my flattererbeing so great I have no need to begyet askand shall I haveyou shallthen give me leave to gowhitherwhither you will so I were from your sightsgo some of you convey him to the TowerO good convey conveyers are you allthat rise thus nimbly by a true kings fallon Wednesday next we solemnly set downour coronation lords prepare yourselvesa woeful pageant have we here beheldthe woes to come the children yet unbornshall feel this day as sharp to them as thornyou holy clergymen is there no plotto rid the realm of this pernious blotmy lordbefore I freely speak my mind hereinyou shall not only take the sacramentto bury mine intents but also to effectwhatever I shall happen to deviseI see your brows are full of discontentyour hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tearscome home with me to supper I will laya plot shall show us all a merry daythis way the king will come this is the wayto Julius Ceasars ill-erected towerto whose flint bosom my condemned lordis doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbrokehere let us rest if this rebellious earthhave any resting for her true kings queenbut soft but see or rather do not seemy fair rose wither yet look up beholdthat you in pity may dissolve to dewand wash him fresh again with true-love tearsah thou the model where old Troy did standthou map of honour thou king Richards tomband not king Richard thou most beauteous innwhy should hard-favoured grief be lodged in theewhen triumph is become an alehouse guestjoin not with grief fair woman do not soto make my end too sudden learn good soulto think our former state a happy dreamfrom which awaked the truth of what we areshows us but this I am sworn brother sweetto grim Necessity and he and Iwill keep a league till death chide thee to Franceand cloister thee in some religious houseour holy lives must win a new worlds crownwhich our profane hours here have stricken downwhat is my Richard both in shape and mindtransformed and weakened hath Bolingbroke deposedthine intellect hath he been in thy heartthe lion dying thrusteth forth his pawand wounds the earth if nothing else with rageto be oerpowered and wilt thou pupil-liketake thy correction mildly kiss the rodand fawn on rage with base humilitywhich art a lion and a king of beastsa king of beasts indeed if aught but beastsI had been still a happy king of mengood sometime queen prepare thee hence for Francethink I am dead and that even here thou takestas from my death-bed my last living leavein winters tedious nights sit by the firewith good old folks and let them tell thee talesof woeful ages long ago betidand ere thou bid good night to quit their grieftell thou the lamentable tale of meand send the hearers weeping to their bedsfor why the senseless brands will sympathizethe heavy accent of thy moving tongueand in compassion weep the fire outand some will mourn in ashes some coal-blackfor the deposing of a rightful kingmy lord the mind of Bolingbroke is changedyou must to Pomfret not unto the Towerand madam there is order taen for youwith all swift speed you must away to Francenorthumberland thou ladder wherewithalthe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my thronethe time shall not be many hours of agemore than it is ere foul sin gathering headshall break into corruption thou shalt thinkthough he divide the realm and give thee halfit is too little helping him to alland he shall think that thou which knowest the wayto plant unrightful kings wilt know againbeing neer so little urged another wayto pluck him headlong from the usurped thronethe love of wicked friends converts to fearthat fear to hate and hate turns one or bothto worthy danger and deserved deathmy guilt be on my head and there an endtake leave and part for you must part forthwithdoubly divorced Bad men ye violatea two-fold marriage btwixt my crown and meand then betwixt me and my married wifelet me unkiss the oath btwixt thee and meand yet not so for with a kiss itwas madepart us northumberland I towards the northwhere shivering cold and sickness pines the climemy wife to France from whence set forth in pompshe came adorned hither like sweet Maysent back like Hallowmas or shortest of dayand must we be divided must we partay hand from hand my love and heart from heartbanish us both and send the king with methat were some love but little policythen whither he goes thither let me goso two together weeping make one woeweep thou for me in France I for thee herebetter far off than near be neer the neargo count thy way with sighs I mine with groansso longest way shall have the longest moanstwice for one step iull groan the way being shortand piece the way out with a heavy heartcome come in wooing sorrow lets be briefsince wedding it thero is such length in griefone kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly partthus give I mine and thus take I thy heartgive me mine own again itwere no good partto take on me to keep and kill thy heartso now I have mine own again be gonethat I may strive to kill it with a groanwe make woe wanton with this fond delayonce more adieu the rest let sorrow saymy lord you told me you would tell the restwhen weeping made you break the story offof our two cousins coming into Londonwhere did I leaveat that sad stop my lordwhere rude misgoverned hands from windows topsthrew dust and rubbish on king Richards headthen as I said the duke great Bolingbrokemounted upon a hot and fiery steedwhich his aspiring rider seemed to knowwith slow but stately pace kept on his coursewhile all tongues cried God save thee Bolingbroke you would have thought the very windows spakeso many greedy looks of young and oldthrough casements darted their desiring eyesupon his visage and that all the wallswith painted imagery had said at oncejesu preserve thee welcome Bolingbroke whilst he from one side to the other turningbare-headed lower than his proud steeds neckbespake them thus I thank you countrymen and thus still doing thus he passed alongalack poor Richard where rode he the whilstas in a theatre the eyes of menafter a well-graced actor leaves the stageare idly bent on him that enters nextthinking his prattle to be tediouseven so or with much more contempt mens eyesdid scowl on Richard no man cried God save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome homebut dust was thrown upon his sacred headwhich with such gentle sorrow he shook offhis face still combating with tears and smilesthe badges of his grief and patiencethat had not God for some strong purpose steeledthe hearts of men they must perforce have meltedand barbarism itself have pitied himbut heaven hath a hand in these eventsto whose high will we bound our calm contentsto Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects nowwhose state and honour I for aye allowhere comes my son Aumerleaumerle that wasbut that

the gallanthis answer was he would unto the stewsand from the commonest creature pluck a gloveand wear it as a favour and with thathe would unhorse the lustiest challengeras dissolute as

if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teachpardon should be the first word of thy speechI never longed to hear a word till nowsay pardon king let pity teach thee howthe word is short but not so short as sweetno word like pardon for kings mouths so meetspeak it in French king say pardonnez moy dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroyah my sour husband my hard-hearted lordthat settest the word

truecome my old son I pray God make thee newdidst thou not mark the king what words he spakehave I no friend will rid me of this living fear was it not sothose were his very wordshave I no friend quoth he he spake it twiceand urged it twice together did he nothe didand speaking it he wistly looked on meas who should say I would thou wert the manthat would divorce this terror from my heart meaning the king at Pomfret come lets goI am the kings friend and will rid his foeI have been studying how I may comparethis prison where I live unto the worldand for because the world is populousand here is not a creature but myselfI cannot do it yet iull hammer it outmy brain iull prove the female to my soulmy soul the father and these two begeta generation of still-breeding thoughtsand these same thoughts people this little worldin humours like the people of this worldfor no thought is contented the better sortas thoughts of things divine are intermixedwith scruples and do set the word itselfagainst the wordas thus come little ones and then againit is as hard to come as for a camelto thread the postern of a needles eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plotunlikely wonders how these vain weak nailsmay tear a passage through the flinty ribsof this hard world my ragged prison wallsand for they cannot die in their own pridethoughts tending to content flatter themselvesthat they are not the first of fortunes slavesnor shall not be the last like silly beggarswho sitting in the stocks refuge their shamethat many have and others must sit thereand in this thought they find a kind of easebearing their own misfortune on the backof such as have before endured the likethus play I in one person many peopleand none contented sometimes am I kingthen treason makes me wish myself a beggarand so I am then crushing penurypersuades me I was better when a kingthen am I kinged again and by and bythink that I am unkinged by Bolingbrokeand straight am nothing but whateer I benor I nor any man that but man iswith nothing shall be pleased till he be easedwith being nothing Music do I hearha ha keep time how sour sweet music iswhen time is broke and no proportion keptso is it in the music of mens livesand here have I the daintiness of earto check time broke in a disordered stringbut for the concord of my state and timehad not an ear to hear my true time brokeI wasted time and now doth time waste mefor now hath time made me his numbering clockmy thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jartheir watches on unto mine eyes the outward watchwhereto my finger like a dials pointis pointing still in cleansing them from tearsnow sir the sound that tells what hour it isare clamorous groans that strike upon my heartwhich is the bell so sighs and tears and groansshow minutes times and hours but my timeruns posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joywhile I stand fooling here his Jack ofthe clockthis music mads me let it sound no morefor though it have holp madmen to their witsin me it seems it will make wise men madyet blessing on his heart that gives it mefor itis a sign of love and love to Richardis a strange brooch in this all-hating worldhail royal princethanks noble peerthe cheapest of us is ten groats too dearwhat art thou and how comest thou hither manwhere no man never comes but that sad dogthat brings me food to make misfortune liveI was a poor groom of thy stable kingwhen thou wert king who travelling towards Yorkwith much ado at length have gotten leaveto look upon my sometimes royal masters faceO how it yearned my heart when I beheldin London streets that coronation daywhen Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbarythat horse that thou so often hast bestridthat horse that I so carefully have dressedrode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friendhow went he under himso proudly as if he disdained the groundso proud that Bolingbroke was on his backthat jade hath eat bread from my royal handthis hand hath made him proud with clapping himwould he not stumble would he not fall downsince pride must have a fall and break the neckof that proud man that did usurp his backforgiveness horse why do I rail on theesince thou created to be awed by manwast born to bear I was not made a horseand yet I bear a burden like an assspur-galled and tired by jaunng Bolingbrokefellow give place here is no longer stayif thou love me itis time thou wert awaywhat my tongue dares not that my heart shall saymy lord willit please you to fall totaste of it first as thou art wont to domy lord I dare not sir Pierce of Exton who lately came from the king commands the contrarythe devil take Henry of Lancaster and theepatience is stale and I am weary of ithelp

slain we hear notwelcome my lord what is the newsfirst to thy sacred state wish I all happinessthe next news is I have to London sentthe heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kentthe manner of their taking may appearat large discoursed in this paper herewe thank thee gentle Percy for thy painsand to thy worth will add right worthy gainsmy lord I have from Oxford sent to Londonthe heads of Brocas and sir Bennet Seelytwo of the dangerous consorted traitorsthat sought at Oxford thy dire overthrowthy pains fitzwater shall not be forgotright noble is thy merit well I wotthe grand conspirator Abbot of Westminsterwith clog of consence and sour melancholyhath yielded up his body to the gravebut here is Carlisle living to abidethy kingly doom and sentence of his pridecarlisle this is your doomchoose out some secret place some reverend roommore than thou hast and with it joy thy lifeso as thou livest in peace die free from strifefor though mine enemy thou hast ever beenhigh sparks of honour in thee have I seengreat king within this coffin I presentthy buried fear herein all breathless liesthe mightiest of thy greatest enemiesrichard of Bordeaux by me hither broughtexton I thank thee not for thou hast wroughta deed of slander with thy fatal handupon my head and all this famous landfrom your own mouth my lord did I this deedthey love not poison that do poison neednor do I thee though I did wish him deadI hate the murderer love him murderedthe guilt of consence take thou for thy labourbut neither my good word nor princely favourwith Cain go wander through the shade of nightand never show thy head by day nor lightlords I protest my soul is full of woethat blood should sprinkle me to make me growcome mourn with me for that I do lamentand put on sullen black incontinentiull make a voyage to the Holy Landto wash this blood off from my guilty handmarch sadly after grace my mournings herein weeping after this untimely biernow is the winter of our discontentmade glorious summer by this sun of Yorkand all the clouds that loured upon our housein the deep bosom of the ocean buriednow are our brows bound with victorious wreathsour bruised arms hung up for monumentsour stern alarums changed to merry meetingsour dreadful marches to delightful measuresgrim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled frontand now instead of mounting barbed steedsto fright the souls of fearful adversarieshe capers nimbly in a ladys chamberto the lasvious pleasing of a lutebut I that am not shaped for sportive tricksnor made to court an amorous looking-glassI that am rudely stamped and want loves majestyto strut before a wanton ambling nymphI that am curtailed of this fair proportioncheated of feature by dissembling naturedeformed unfinished sent before my timeinto this breathing world scarce half made upand that so lamely and unfashionablethat dogs bark at me as I halt by themwhy I in this weak piping time of peacehave no delight to pass away the timeunless to see my shadow in the sunand descant on mine own deformityand therefore since I cannot prove a loverto entertain these fair well-spoken daysI am determined to prove a villainand hate the idle pleasures of these daysplots have I laid inductions dangerousby drunken prophees libels and dreamsto set my brother Clarence and the kingin deadly hate the one against the otherand if king Edward be as true and justas I am subtle false and treacherousthis day should Clarence closely be mewed upabout a prophecy which says that gof Edwards heirs the murderer shall bedive thoughts down to my soul here Clarence comesbrother good day what means this armed guardthat waits upon your gracehis majestytendering my persons safety hath appointedthis conduct to convey me to the Towerupon what causebecause my name is Georgealack my lord that fault is none of yourshe should for that commit your godfathersO belike his majesty hath some intentthat you should be new-christened in the Towerbut whats the matter Clarence may I knowyea Richard when I know for I protestas yet I do not but as I can learnhe hearkens after prophees and dreamsand from the cross-row plucks the letter gand says a wizard told him that by ghis issue disinherited should beand for my name of George begins with git follows in his thought that I am hethese as I learn and such like toys as thesehave moved his highness to commit me nowwhy this it is when men are ruled by womenitis not the king that sends you to the Towermy Lady Grey his wife Clarence itis shethat tempers him to this extremitywas it not she and that good man of worshipantony woodville her brother therethat made him send lord hastings to the Towerfrom whence this present day he is deliveredwe are not safe Clarence we are not safeby heaven I think there is no man securebut the queens kindred and night-walking heraldsthat trudge betwixt the king and mistress Shoreheard you not what a humble suppliantlord hastings was to her for his deliveryhumbly complaining to her deitygot my lord chamberlain his libertyiull tell you what I think it is our wayif we will keep in favour with the kingto be her men and wear her liverythe jealous oer-worn widow and herselfsince that our brother dubbed them gentlewomenare mighty gossips in our monarchyI beseech your graces both to pardon mehis majesty hath straitly given in chargethat no man shall have private conferenceof what degree soever with your brothereven so an please your worship Brakenburyyou may partake of anything we saywe speak no treason man we say the kingis wise and virtuous and his noble queenwell struck in years fair and not jealouswe say that Shores wife hath a pretty foota cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongueand that the queens kindred are made gentlefolkshow say you sir can you deny all thiswith this my lord myself have nought to donaught to do with mistress Shore I tell thee fellowhe that doth naught with her excepting onewere best to do it secretly alonewhat one my lordher husband knave wouldst thou betray meI beseech your grace to pardon me and withalforbear your conference with the noble dukewe know thy charge Brakenbury and will obeywe are the queens abjects and must obeybrother farewell I will unto the kingand whatsoeer you will employ me inwere it to call king Edwards widow sisterI will perform it to enfranchise youmeantime this deep disgrace in brotherhoodtouches me deeper than you can imagineI know it pleaseth neither of us wellwell your imprisonment shall not be longI will deliver you or else lie for youmeantime have patienceI must perforce farewellgo tread the path that thou shalt neer returnsimple plain Clarence I do love thee sothat I will shortly send thy soul to heavenif heaven will take the present at our handsbut who comes here the new-delivered hastingsgood time of day unto my gracious lordas much unto my good lord chamberlainwell are you welcome to this open airhow hath your lordship brooked imprisonmentwith patience noble lord as prisoners mustbut I shall live my lord to give them thanksthat were the cause of my imprisonmentno doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence toofor they that were your enemies are hisand have prevailed as much on him as youmore pity that the eagles should be mewedwhile kites and buzzards prey at libertywhat news abroadno news so bad abroad as this at homethe king is sickly weak and melancholyand his physians fear him mightilynow by Saint Paul this news is bad indeedO he hath kept an evil diet longand over-much consumed his royal personitis very grievous to be thought uponwhat is he in his bedhe isgo you before and I will follow youhe cannot live I hope and must not dietill George be packed with post-horse up to heaveniull in to urge his hatred more to Clarencewith lies well steeled with weighty argumentsand if I fail not in my deep intentclarence hath not another day to livewhich done God take king Edward to his mercyand leave the world for me to bustle infor then iull marry Warwicks youngest daughterwhat though I killed her husband and her fatherthe readiest way to make the wench amendsis to become her husband and her fatherthe which will I not all so much for loveas for another secret close intentby marrying her which I must reach untobut yet I run before my horse to marketclarence still breathes Edward still lives and reignswhen they are gone then must I count my gainsset down set down your honourable loadif honour may be shrouded in a hearsewhilst I a while obsequiously lamentthe untimely fall of virtuous Lancasterpoor key-cold figure of a holy kingpale ashes of the house of Lancasterthou bloodless remnant of that royal bloodbe it lawful that I invocate thy ghostto hear the lamentations of poor Annewife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered sonstabbed by the self-same hand that made these woundslo in these windows that let forth thy lifeI pour the helpless balm of my poor eyesO cursed be the hand that made these holescursed the heart that had the heart to do itcursed the blood that let this blood from hencemore direful hap betide that hated wretchthat makes us wretched by the death of theethan I can wish to adders spiders toadsor any creeping venomed thing that livesif ever he have child abortive be itprodigious and untimely brought to lightwhose ugly and unnatural aspectmay fright the hopeful mother at the viewand that be heir to his unhappinessif ever he have wife let her be mademore miserable by the death of himthan I am made by my young lord and theecome now toward Chertsey with your holy loadtaken from Pauls to be interred thereand still as you are weary of the weightrest you whiles I lament king Henrys corsestay you that bear the corse and set it downwhat black magian conjures up this fiendto stop devoted charitable deedsvillains set down the corse or by Saint Pauliull make a corse of him that disobeysmy lord stand back and let the coffin passunmannered dog stand thou when I commandadvance thy halberd higher than my breastor by Saint Paul iull strike thee to my footand spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldnesswhat do you tremble are you all afraidalas I blame you not for you are mortaland mortal eyes cannot endure the devilavaunt thou dreadful minister of hellthou hadst but power over his mortal bodyhis soul thou canst not have therefore be gonesweet saint for charity be not so curstfoul devil for Gods sake hence and trouble us notfor thou hast made the happy earth thy hellfilled it with cursing cries and deep exclaimsif thou delight to view thy heinous deedsbehold this pattern of thy butcheriesO gentlemen see see dead Henrys woundsopen their congealed mouths and bleed afreshblush blush thou lump of foul deformityfor itis thy presence that exhales this bloodfrom cold and empty veins where no blood dwellsthy deed inhuman and unnaturalprovokes this deluge most unnaturalO God which this blood madest revenge his deathO earth which this blood drinkest revenge his deatheither heaven with lightning strike the murderer deador earth gape open wide and eat him quickas thou dost swallow up this good kings bloodwhich his hell-governed arm hath butcheredlady you know no rules of charitywhich renders good for bad blessings for cursesvillain thou knowest no law of God nor manno beast so fierce but knows some touch of pitybut I know none and therefore am no beastO wonderful when devils tell the truthmore wonderful when angels are so angryvouchsafe divine perfection of a womanof these supposed evils to give me leaveby rcumstance but to acquit myselfvouchsafe diffused infection of a manfor these known evils but to give me leaveby rcumstance to curse thy cursed selffairer than tongue can name thee let me havesome patient leisure to excuse myselffouler than heart can think thee thou canst makeno excuse current but to hang thyselfby such despair I should accuse myselfand by despairing shouldst thou stand excusedfor doing worthy vengeance on thyselfwhich didst unworthy slaughter upon otherssay that I slew them notthen say they were not slainbut dead they are and devilish slave by theeI did not kill your husbandwhy then he is alivenay he is dead and slain by Edwards handin thy foul throat thou liest queen Margaret sawthy murderous falchion smoking in his bloodthe which thou once didst bend against her breastbut that thy brothers beat aside the pointI was provoked by her slandrous tonguethat laid their guilt upon my guiltless shouldersthou wast provoked by thy bloody mindthat never dreamt on aught but butcheriesdidst thou not kill this kingI grant yedost grant me hedge-hog then God grant me toothou mayst be damned for that wicked deedO he was gentle mild and virtuousthe fitter for the king of heaven that hath himhe is in heaven where thou shalt never comelet him thank me that helped to send him thitherfor he was fitter for that place than earthand thou unfit for any place but hellyes one place else if you will bear me name itsome dungeonyour bed-chamberill rest betide the chamber where thou liestso will it madam till I lie with youI hope soI know so but gentle Lady Anneto leave this keen encounter of our witsand fall somewhat into a slower methodis not the causer of the timeless deathsof these Plantagenets Henry and Edwardas blameful as the executionerthou wast the cause and most accursed effectyour beauty was the cause of that effectyour beauty that did haunt me in my sleepto undertake the death of all the worldso might I live one hour in your sweet bosomif I thought that I tell thee homidethese nails should rend that beauty from my cheeksthese eyes could not endure that beautys wrackyou should not blemish it if I stood byas all the world is cheered by the sunso I by that it is my day my lifeblack night oershade thy day and death thy lifecurse not thyself fair creature thou art bothI would I were to be revenged on theeit is a quarrel most unnaturalto be revenged on him that loveth theeit is a quarrel just and reasonableto be revenged on him that killed my husbandhe that bereft thee lady of thy husbanddid it to help thee to a better husbandhis better doth not breathe upon the earthhe lives that loves thee better than he couldname himplantagenetwhy that was hethe self-same name but one of better naturewhere is heherewhy dost thou spit at mewould it were mortal poison for thy sakenever came poison from so sweet a placenever hung poison on a fouler toadout of my sight thou dost infect mine eyesthine eyes sweet lady have infected minewould they were basilisks to strike thee deadI would they were that I might die at oncefor now they kill me with a living deaththose eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tearsshamed their aspects with store of childish dropsthese eyes which never shed remorseful tearno when my father York and Edward weptto hear the piteous moan that Rutland madewhen black-faced Clifford shook his sword at himnor when thy war-like father like a childtold the sad story of my fathers deathand twenty times made pause to sob and weepthat all the standers-by had wet their cheekslike trees bedashed with rain in that sad timemy manly eyes did scorn an humble tearand what these sorrows could not thence exhalethy beauty hath and made them blind with weepingI never sued to friend nor enemymy tongue could never learn sweet smoothing wordsbut now thy beauty is proposed my feemy proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speakteach not thy lip such scorn for it was madefor kissing lady not for such contemptif thy revengeful heart cannot forgivelo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed swordwhich if thou please to hide in this true breastand let the soul forth that adoreth theeI lay it open to the deadly strokeand humbly beg the death upon my kneenay do not pause for I did kill king Henrybut itwas thy beauty that provoked menay now dispatch itwas I that stabbed young Edwardbut itwas thy heavenly face that set me ontake up the sword again or take up mearise dissembler though I wish thy deathI will not be thy executionerthen bid me kill myself and I will do itI have alreadythat was in thy ragespeak it again and even with the wordthis hand which for thy love did kill thy loveshall for thy love kill a far truer loveto both their deaths shalt thou be accessaryI would I knew thy heartitis figured in my tongueI fear me both are falsethen never man was truewell well put up your swordsay then my peace is madethat shalt thou know hereafterbut shall I live in hopeall men I hope live sovouchsafe to wear this ringto take is not to givelook how my ring encompasseth thy fingereven so thy breast encloseth my poor heartwear both of them for both of them are thineand if thy poor devoted servant maybut beg one favour at thy gracious handthou dost confirm his happiness for everwhat is itthat it may please you leave these sad designsto him that hath most cause to be a mournerand presently repair to Crosby-placewhere after I have solemnly interredat Chertsey monastery this noble kingand wet his grave with my repentant tearsI will with all expedient duty see youfor divers unknown reasons I beseech yougrant me this boonwith all my heart and much it joys me tooto see you are become so penitenttressel and Berkeley go along with mebid me farewellitis more than you deservebut since you teach me how to flatter youimagine I have said farewell alreadysirs take up the corsetoward Chertsey noble lordno to White-friars there attend my comingwas ever woman in this humour wooedwas ever woman in this humour woniull have her but I will not keep her longwhat I that killed her husband and his fatherto take her in her hearts extremest hatewith curses in her mouth tears in her eyesthe bleeding witness of her hatred byhaving God her consence and these bars against meand nothing I to back my suit withalbut the plain devil and dissembling looksand yet to win her all the world to nothinghahath she forgot already that brave princeedward her lord whom I some three months sincestabbed in my angry mood at Tewksburya sweeter and a lovelier gentlemanframed in the prodigality of natureyoung valiant wise and no doubt right royalthe spaous world cannot again affordand will she yet abase her eyes on methat cropped the golden prime of this sweet princeand made her widow to a woeful bedon me whose all not equals Edwards moietyon me that halt and am misshapen thusmy dukedom to a beggarly denierI do mistake my person all this whileupon my life she finds although I cannotmyself to be a marvellous proper maniull be at charges for a looking-glassand entertain a score or two of tailorsto study fashions to adorn my bodysince I am crept in favour with myselfI will maintain it with some little costbut first iull turn yon fellow in his graveand then return lamenting to my loveshine out fair sun till I have bought a glassthat I may see my shadow as I passhave patience madam theres no doubt his majestywill soon recover his accustomed healthin that you brook it ill it makes him worsetherefore for Gods sake entertain good comfortand cheer his grace with quick and merry wordsif he were dead what would betide on meno other harm but loss of such a lordthe loss of such a lord includes all harmsthe heavens have blessed you with a goodly sonto be your comforter when he is goneah he is young and his minorityis put into the trust of Richard Gloucestera man that loves not me nor none of youis it concluded he shall be protectorit is determined not concluded yetbut so it must be if the king miscarryhere come the lords of Buckingham and Stanleygood time of day unto your royal gracegod make your majesty joyful as you have beenthe Countess Richmond good my lord of Stanleyto your good prayer will scarcely say amenyet Stanley notwithstanding shes your wifeand loves not me be you good lord assuredI hate not you for her proud arroganceI do beseech you either not believethe envious slanders of her false accusersor if she be accused on true reportbear with her weakness which I think proceedsfrom wayward sickness and no grounded malicesaw you the king to-day my lord of Stanleybut now the duke of Buckingham and Iare come from visiting his majestywhat likelihood of his amendment lordsmadam good hope his grace speaks cheerfullygod grant him health did you confer with himay madam he desires to make atonementbetween the duke of Gloucester and your brothersand between them and my lord chamberlainand sent to warn them to his royal presencewould all were well but that will never beI fear our happiness is at the highestthey do me wrong and I will not endure itwho are they that complain unto the kingthat I forsooth am stern and love them notby holy Paul they love his grace but lightlythat fill his ears with such dissentious rumoursbecause I cannot flatter and speak fairsmile in mens faces smooth deceive and cogduck with French nods and apish courtesyI must be held a rancorous enemycannot a plain man live and think no harmbut thus his simple truth must be abusedby silken sly insinuating Jacksto whom in all this presence speaks your graceto thee that hast nor honesty nor gracewhen have I injured thee when done thee wrongor thee or thee or any of your factiona plague upon you all his royal personwhom God preserve better than you would wishcannot be quiet scarce a breathing-whilebut you must trouble him with lewd complaintsbrother of Gloucester you mistake the matterthe king on his own royal dispositionand not provoked by any suitor elseaiming belike at your interior hatredthat in your outward action shows itselfagainst my children brothers and myselfmakes him to send that thereby he may gatherthe ground of your ill-will and so remove itI cannot tell the world is grown so badthat wrens make

friendsgod grant we never may have need of youmeantime God grants that we have need of youour brother is imprisoned by your meansmyself disgraced and the nobilityheld in contempt while great promotionsare daily given to ennoble thosethat scarce some two days since were worth a nobleby him that raised me to this careful heightfrom that contented hap which I enjoyedI never did incense

pretty Rutlandhis curses then from bitterness of souldenounced against thee are all falln upon theeand God not we hath plagued thy bloody deedso just is God to right the innocentO itwas the foulest deed to slay that babeand the most merless that eer was heard oftyrants themselves wept when it was reportedno man but prophesied revenge for itnorthumberland then present wept to see

to the deathhave not to do with him beware of himsin death and hell have set their marks on himand all their ministers attend on himwhat doth she say my lord of Buckinghamnothing that I respect my gracious lordwhat dost thou scorn me for my gentle counseland soothe the devil that I warn thee fromO but remember this another daywhen he shall split thy very heart with sorrowand say poor Margaret was a prophetesslive each of you the subject to his hateand he to yours and all of you to Godsmy hair doth stand on end to hear her cursesand so doth mine I muse why shes at libertyI cannot blame her by Gods holy mothershe hath had too much wrong and I repentmy part thereof that I have done to herI never did her any to my knowledgeyet you have all the vantage of her wrongI was too hot to do somebody goodthat is too cold in thinking of it nowmarry as for Clarence he is well repaidhe is franked up to fatting for his painsgod pardon them that are the cause thereofa virtuous and a christian-like conclusionto pray for them that have done scath to usso do I everbeing well-advisedfor had I cursed now I had cursed myselfmadam his majesty doth call for youand for your grace and you my noble lordscatesby I come lords will you go with mewe wait upon your graceI do the wrong and first begin to brawlthe secret mischiefs that I set abroachI lay unto the grievous charge of othersclarence whom I indeed have cast in darknessI do beweep to many simple gullsnamely to Stanley hastings Buckinghamand tell them itis the queen and her alliesthat stir the king against the duke my brothernow they believe it and withal whet meto be revenged on Rivers Vaughan Greybut then I sigh and with a piece of scripturetell them that God bids us do good for eviland thus I clothe my naked villanywith odd old ends stoln forth of holy writand seem a saint when most I play the devilbut soft here come my executionershow now my hardy stout resolved matesare you now going to dispatch this thingwe are my lord and come to have the warrantthat we may be admitted where he iswell thought upon I have it here about mewhen you have done repair to Crosby-placebut sirs be sudden in the executionwithal obdurate do not hear him pleadfor Clarence is well-spoken and perhapsmay move your hearts to pity if you mark himtut tut my lord we will not stand to pratetalkers are no good doers be assuredwe go to use our hands and not our tonguesyour eyes drop millstones when fools eyes fall tearsI like you lads about your business straightgo go dispatchwe will my noble lordwhy looks your grace so heavily to-dayO I have passed a miserable nightso full of ugly sights of ghastly dreamsthat as I am a christian faithful manI would not spend another such a nightthough itwere to buy a world of happy daysso full of dismal terror was the timewhat was your dream my lord I pray you tell memethought that I had broken from the Towerand was embarked to cross to Burgundyand in my company my brother Gloucesterwho from my cabin tempted me to walkupon the hatches thence we looked toward Englandand ted up a thousand heavy timesduring the wars of York and Lancasterthat had befalln us as we paced alongupon the giddy footing of the hatchesmethought that Gloucester stumbled and in fallingstruck me that thought to stay him overboardinto the tumbling billows of the mainlord lord methought what pain it was to drownwhat dreadful noise of water in mine earswhat sights of ugly death within mine eyesmethought I saw a thousand fearful wracksa thousand men that fishes gnawed uponwedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearlinestimable stones unvalued jewelsall scattered in the bottom of the seasome lay in dead mens skulls and in those holeswhere eyes did once inhabit there were creptas itwere in scorn of eyes reflecting gemsthat wooed the slimy bottom of the deepand mocked the dead bones that lay scattered byhad you such leisure in the time of deathto gaze upon those secrets of the deepmethought I had and often did I striveto yield the ghost but still the envious floodstopt in my soul and would not let it forthto find the empty vast and wandering airbut smothered it within my panting bulkwhich almost burst to belch it in the seaawaked you not with this sore agonyno no my dream was lengthened after lifeO then began the tempest to my soulI passed methought the melancholy floodwith that grim ferryman which poets write ofunto the kingdom of perpetual nightthe first that there did greet my stranger soulwas my great father-in-law renowned Warwickwho cried aloud what scourge for perjurycan this dark monarchy afford false Clarence and so he vanished then came wandering bya shadow like an angel with bright hairdabbled in blood and he shrieked out aloudclarence is come false fleeting perjured Clarencethat stabbed me in the field by Tewksburyseize on him furies take him unto torment with that methought a legion of foul fiendsenvironed me and howled in mine earssuch hideous cries that with the very noiseI trembling waked and for a season aftercould not believe but that I was in hellsuch terrible impression made my dreamno marvel lord though it affrighted youI am afraid methinks to hear you tell itO Brakenbury I have done these thingsthat now give evidence against my soulfor Edwards sake and see how he requites meO God if my deep prayers cannot appease theebut thou wilt be avenged on my misdeedsyet execute thy wrath on me aloneO spare my guiltless wife and my poor childrenI pray thee gentle keeper stay by memy soul is heavy and I fain would sleepI will my lord God give your grace good restsorrow breaks seasons and reposing hoursmakes the night morning and the noon-tide nightprinces have but their titles for their gloriesan outward honour for an inward toiland for unfelt imaginationsthey often feel a world of restless caresso that between their titles and low namestheres nothing differs but the outward fameho whos herewhat wouldst thou fellow and how camest thou hitherI would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legswhat so briefitis better sir than to be tediouslet him see our commission and talk no moreI am in this commanded to deliverthe noble duke of Clarence to your handsI will not reason what is meant herebybecause I will be guiltless of the meaningthere lies the duke asleep and there the keysiull to the king and signify to himthat thus I have resigned to you my chargeyou may sir itis a point of wisdom fare you wellwhat shall we stab him as he sleepsno hell say itwas done cowardly when he wakeswhen he wakes why fool he shall never wake till the judgment-daywhy then hell say we stabbed him sleepingthe urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in mewhat art thou afraidnot to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend meI thought thou hadst been resoluteso I am to let him liveiull back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him sonay I prithee stay a little I hope my holy humour will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twentyhow dost thou feel thyself nowsome certain dregs of consence are yet within meremember our reward when the deeds doneZounds he dies I had forgot the rewardwheres thy consence nowin the duke of Gloucesters purseso when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy consence flies outitis no matter let it go theres few or none will entertain itwhat if it come to thee againiull not meddle with it it makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him itis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and ties for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without itZounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duketake the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sightut I am strong-framed he cannot prevail with mespoke like a tall fellow that respects his reputation come shall we to this geartake him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then throw him into the malmsey-butt in the next roomO excellent device make a sop of himsoft he wakesstrikeno well reason with himwhere art thou keeper give me a cup of wineyou shall have wine enough my lord anonin Gods name what art thoua man as you arebut not as I am royalnor you as we are loyalthy voice is thunder but thy looks are humblemy voice is now the kings my looks mine ownhow darkly and how deadly dost thou speakyour eyes do menace me why look you palewho sent you hither wherefore do you cometo to toto murder meay ayyou scarcely have the hearts to tell me soand therefore cannot have the hearts to do itwherein my friends have I offended youoffended us you have not but the kingI shall be reconled to him againnever my lord therefore prepare to dieare you called forth from out a world of mento slay the innocent what is my offencewhere is the evidence that doth accuse mewhat lawful quest have given their verdict upunto the frowning judge or who pronouncedthe bitter sentence of poor Clarence deathbefore I be convict by course of lawto threaten me with death is most unlawfulI charge you as you hope to have redemptionby Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sinsthat you depart and lay no hands on methe deed you undertake is damnablewhat we will do we do upon commandand he that hath commanded is our kingerroneous vassal the great king of kingshath in the table of his law commandedthat thou shalt do no murder will you thenspurn at his edict and fulfil a manstake heed for he holds vengeance in his handto hurl upon their heads that break his lawand that same vengeance doth he hurl on theefor false forswearing and for murder toothou didst receive the sacrament to fightin quarrel of the house of Lancasterand like a traitor to the name of Goddidst break that vow and with thy treacherous bladeunrippedst the bowels of thy sovereigns sonwhom thou wast sworn to cherish and defendhow canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to uswhen thou hast broke it in such dear degreealas for whose sake did I that ill deedfor Edward for my brother for his sakehe sends you not to murder me for thisfor in that sin he is as deep as Iif God will be avenged for the deedO know you yet he doth it publiclytake not the quarrel from his powerful armhe needs no indirect or lawless courseto cut off those that have offended himwho made thee then a bloody ministerwhen gallant-springing brave Plantagenetthat princely novice was struck dead by theemy brothers love the devil and my ragethy brothers love our duty and thy faultprovoke us hither now to slaughter theeif you do love my brother hate not meI am his brother and I love him wellif you are hired for meed go back againand I will send you to my brother Gloucesterwho shall reward you better for my lifethan Edward will for tidings of my deathyou are deceived your brother Gloucester hates youO no he loves me and he holds me deargo you to him from meay so we willtell him when that our princely father Yorkblessed his three sons with his victorious armand charged us from his soul to love each otherhe little thought of this divided friendshipbid Gloucester think on this and he will weepay millstones as he lessoned us to weepO do not slander him for he is kindrightas snow in harvest thou deceivest thyselfitis he that sends us to destroy you hereit cannot be for he bewept my fortuneand hugged me in his arms and swore with sobsthat he would labour my deliverywhy so he doth when he delivers youfrom this earths thraldom to the joys of heavenmake peace with God for you must die my lordhast thou that holy feeling in thy soulto counsel me to make my peace with Godand art thou yet to thy own soul so blindthat thou wilt war with God by murdering meO sirs consider he that set you onto do this deed will hate you for the deedwhat shall we dorelent and save your soulsrelent itis cowardly and womanishnot to relent is beastly savage devilishwhich of you if you were a princes sonbeing pent from liberty as I am nowif two such murdrers as yourselves came to youwould not entreat for lifemy friend I spy some pity in thy looksO if thine eye be not a flatterercome thou on my side and entreat for meas you would beg were you in my distressa begging prince what beggar pities notlook behind you my lordtake that and that if all this will not doiull drown you in the malmsey-butt withina bloody deed and desperately dispatchedhow fain like Pilate would I wash my handsof this most grievous murderhow now what meanest thou that thou helpest me notby heaven the duke shall know how slack you have beenI would he knew that I had saved his brothertake thou the fee and tell him what I sayfor I repent me that the duke is slainso do not I go coward as thou artwell iull go hide the body in some holetill that the duke give order for his burialand when I have my meed I will awayfor this will out and here I must not staywhy so now have I done a good days workyou peers continue this united leagueI every day expect an embassagefrom my Redeemer to redeem me henceand more in peace my soul shall part to heavensince I have made my friends at peace on earthrivers and hastings take each others handdissemble not your hatred swear your loveby heaven my soul is purged from grudging hateand with my hand I seal my true hearts loveso thrive I as I truly swear the liketake heed you dally not before your kinglest he that is the supreme king of kingsconfound your hidden falsehood and awardeither of you to be the others endso prosper I as I swear perfect loveand I as I love hastings with my heartmadam yourself are not exempt in thisnor you son Dorset Buckingham nor youyou have been factious one against the otherwife love lord hastings let him kiss your handand what you do do it unfeignedlythere hastings I will never more rememberour former hatred so thrive I and minedorset embrace him hastings love lord marquessthis interchange of love I here protestupon my part shall be inviolableand so swear Inow princely Buckingham seal thou this leaguewith thy embracements to my wifes alliesand make me happy in your unitywhenever Buckingham doth turn his hateupon your grace but with all duteous lovedoth cherish you and yours God punish mewith hate in those where I expect most lovewhen I have most need to employ a friendand most assured that he is a frienddeep hollow treacherous and full of guilebe he unto me this do I beg of Godwhen I am cold in love to you or yoursa pleasing cordial princely Buckinghamis this thy vow unto my sickly heartthere wanteth now our brother Gloucester hereto make the blessed period of this peaceand in good time here comes the noble dukegood morrow to my sovereign king and queenand princely peers a happy time of dayhappy indeed as we have spent the daygloucester we have done deeds of charitymade peace of enmity fair love of hatebetween these swelling wrong-incensed peersa blessed labour my most sovereign lordamong this princely heap if any hereby false intelligence or wrong surmisehold me a foeif I unwittingly or in my ragehave aught committed that is hardly borneby any in this presence I desireto reconle me to his friendly peaceitis death to me to be at enmityI hate it and desire all good mens lovefirst madam I entreat true peace of youwhich I will purchase with my duteous serviceof you my noble cousin Buckinghamif ever any grudge were lodged between usof you lord Rivers and lord Grey of youthat all without desert have frowned on meof you lord woodvile and lord Scales of youdukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of allI do not know that Englishman alivewith whom my soul is any jot at oddsmore than the infant that is born to-nightI thank my God for my humilitya holy day shall this be kept hereafterI would to God all strifes were well compoundedmy sovreign lord I do beseech your highnessto take our brother Clarence to your gracewhy madam have I offered love for thisto be so flouted in this royal presencewho knows not that the gentle duke is deadyou do him injury to scorn his corsewho knows not he is dead who knows he isall-seeing heaven what a world is thislook I so pale lord Dorset as the restay my good lord and no man in the presencebut his red colour hath forsook his cheeksis Clarence dead the order was reversedbut he poor man by your first order diedand that a winged Mercury did bearsome tardy cripple bore the countermandthat came too lag to see him buriedgod grant that some less noble and less loyalnearer in bloody thoughts and not in blooddeserve not worse than wretched Clarence didand yet go current from suspiona boon my sovreign for my service doneI prithee peace my soul is full of sorrowI will not rise unless your highness hear methen say at once what is it thou requestestthe forfeit sovereign of my servants lifewho slew to-day a riotous gentlemanlately attendant on the duke of norfolkhave I a tongue to doom my brothers deathand shall that tongue give pardon to a slavemy brother killed no man his fault was thoughtand yet his punishment was bitter deathwho sued to me for him who in my wrathkneeled at my feet and bade me be advisedwho spoke of brotherhood who spoke of lovewho told me how the poor soul did forsakethe mighty Warwick and did fight for mewho told me in the field at Tewksburywhen Oxford had me down he rescued meand said edear brother live and be a king who told me when we both lay in the fieldfrozen almost to death how he did lap meeven in his garments and did give himselfall thin and naked to the numb cold nightall this from my remembrance brutish wrathsinfully plucked and not a man of youhad so much grace to put it in my mindbut when your carters or your waiting-vassalshave done a drunken slaughter and defacedthe precious image of our dear Redeemeryou straight are on your knees for pardon pardonand I unjustly too must grant it youbut for my brother not a man would speaknor I ungracious speak unto myselffor him poor soul the proudest of you allhave been beholding to him in his lifeyet none of you would once beg for his lifeO God I fear thy justice will take holdon me and you and mine and yours for thiscome hastings help me to my closet O poor Clarencethis is the fruit of rashness Marked you nothow that the guilty kindred of the queenlooked pale when they did hear of Clarence deathO they did urge it still unto the kinggod will revenge it come lords will you goto comfort Edward with our companywe wait upon your gracegood grandam tell us is our father deadno boywhy do you wring your hands and beat your breastand

sickness of the kingas loath to lose him not your fathers deathit were lost sorrow to wail one thats lostthen grandam you conclude that he is deadthe king mine uncle is to blame for itgod will revenge it whom I will importunewith earnest prayers all to that effectand so will Ipeace children peace the king doth love you wellincapable and shallow innocentsyou cannot guess who caused your fathers deathgrandam we can for my good uncle Gloucestertold me the king provoked toit by the queendevised impeachments to imprison himand when my uncle told me so he weptand pitied me and kindly kissed my cheekbade me rely on him as on my fatherand he would love me dearly as his childah that deceit should steal such gentle shapeand with a virtuous vizard hide deep vicehe is my son ay and therein my shameyet from my dugs he drew not this deceitthink you my uncle did dissemble grandamay boyI cannot think it hark what noise is thisoh who shall hinder me to wail and weepto chide my fortune and torment myselfiull join with black despair against my souland to myself become an enemywhat means this scene of rude impatienceto make an act of tragic violenceedward my lord thy son our king is deadwhy grow the branches now the root is witheredwhy wither not the leaves that want their sapif you will live lament if die be briefthat our swift-winged souls may catch the kingsor like obedient subjects follow himto his new kingdom of perpetual restah so much interest have I in thy sorrowas I had title in thy noble husbandI have bewept a worthy husbands deathand lived with looking on his imagesbut now two mirrors of his princely semblanceare cracked in pieces by malignant deathand I for comfort have but one false glassthat grieves me when I see my shame in himthou art a widow yet thou art a motherand hast the comfort of thy children left theebut death hath snatched my husband from mine armsand plucked two crutches from my feeble limbsclarence and Edward O what cause have Ithine being but a moiety of my griefto overgo thy plaints and drown thy criesah aunt you wept not for our fathers deathhow can we aid you with our kindred tearsour fatherless distress was left unmoanedyour widow-dolour likewise be unweptgive me no help in lamentationI am not barren to bring forth complaintsall springs reduce their currents to mine eyesthat I being governed by the watry moonmay send forth plenteous tears to drown the worldah for my husband for my dear lord Edwardah for our father for our dear lord Clarencealas for both both mine Edward and Clarencewhat stay had I but Edward and hes gonewhat stay had we but Clarence and hes gonewhat stays had I but they and they are gonewas never widow had so dear a losswere never orphans had so

lamentationcomfort dear mother God is much displeasedthat you take with unthankfulness his doingin common worldly things itis called ungratefulwith dull unwillingness to repay a debtwhich with a bounteous hand was kindly lentmuch more to be thus opposite with heavenfor it requires the royal debt it lent youmadam bethink you like a careful motherof the young prince your son send straight for himlet him be crowned in him your comfort livesdrown desperate sorrow in dead Edwards graveand plant your joys in living Edwards thronesister have comfort all of us have causeto wail the dimming of our shining starbut none can cure their harms by wailing themmadam my mother I do cry you mercyI did not see your grace humbly on my kneeI crave your blessinggod bless thee and put meekness in thy mindlove charity obedience and true dutyamenand make me die a good old manthat is the butt-end of a mothers blessingI marvel that her grace did leave it outyou cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peersthat bear this heavy mutual load of moannow cheer each other in each others lovethough we have spent our harvest of this kingwe are to reap the harvest of his sonthe broken rancour of your high-swoln heartsbut lately splintered knit and joined togethermust gently be preserved cherished and keptme seemeth good that with some little trainforthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetchedhither to London to be crowned our kingwhy with some little train my lord of Buckinghammarry my lord lest by a multitudethe new-healed wound of malice should break outwhich would be so much the more dangerousby how much the estate is green and yet ungovernedwhere every horse bears his commanding reinand may direct his course as please himselfas well the fear of harm as harm apparentin my opinion ought to be preventedI hope the king made peace with all of usand the compact is firm and true in meand so in me and so I think in allyet since it is but green it should be putto no apparent likelihood of breachwhich haply by much company might be urgedtherefore I say with noble Buckinghamthat it is meet so few should fetch the princeand so say Ithen be it so and go we to determinewho they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlowmadam and you my mother will you goto give your censures in this businessmy lord whoever journeys to the princefor Gods sake let not us two stay at homefor by the way iull sort occasionas index to the story we late talked ofto part the queens proud kindred from the princemy other self my counsels consistorymy oracle my prophet my dear cousinI as a child will go by thy directiontowards Ludlow then for well not stay behindgood morrow neighbour whither away so fastI promise you I scarcely know myselfhear you the news abroaday that the king is deadill news byr lady seldom comes the betterI fear I fear itwill prove a giddy worldneighbours God speedgive you good morrow sirdoth the news hold of good king Edwards deathay sir it is too true God help the whilethen masters look to see a troublous worldno no by Gods good grace his son shall reignwoe to that land thats governed by a childin him there is a hope of governmentthat in his nonage counselunder himand in his full and ripened years himselfno doubt shall then and till then govern wellso stood the state when Henry the Sixthwas crowned at Paris but at nine months oldstood the state so no no good friends God wotfor then this land was famously enrichedwith politic grave counsel then the kinghad virtuous uncles to protect his gracewhy so hath this both by his father and motherbetter it were they all came by his fatheror by his father there were none at allfor emulation who shall now be nearestwill touch us all too near if God prevent notO full of danger is the duke of Gloucesterand the queens sons and brothers haught and proudand were they to be ruled and not to rulethis sickly land might solace as beforecome come we fear the worst all will be wellwhen clouds are seen wise men put on their cloakswhen great leaves fall then winter is at handwhen the sun sets who doth not look for nightuntimely storms make men expect a dearthall may be well but if God sort it soitis more than we deserve or I expecttruly the hearts of men are full of fearyou cannot reason almost with a manthat looks not heavily and full of dreadbefore the days of change still is it soby a divine instinct mens minds mistrustensuing danger as by proof we seethe waters swell before a boisterous stormbut leave it all to God whither awaymarry we were sent for to the justicesand so was I iull bear you companylast night I hear they lay at northamptonat Stony-stratford they do rest to-nightto-morrow or next day they will be hereI long with all my heart to see the princeI hope he is much grown since last I saw himbut I hear no they say my son of Yorkhath almost overtaen him in his growthay mother but I would not have it sowhy my young cousin it is good to growgrandam one night as we did sit at suppermy uncle Rivers talked how I did growmore than my brother Ay quoth my uncle Gloucestersmall herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace and since methinks I would not grow so fastbecause sweet flowers are slow and weeds make hastegood faith good faith the saying did not holdin him that did object the same to theehe was the wretchedest thing when he was youngso long a-growing and so leisurelythat if his rule were true he should be graciousand so no doubt he is my gracious madamI hope he is but yet let mothers doubtnow by my troth if I had been rememberedI could have given my uncles grace a floutto touch his growth nearer than he touched minehow my young York I prithee let me hear itmarry they say my uncle grew so fastthat he could gnaw a crust at two hours olditwas full two years ere I could get a toothgrandam this would have been a biting jestI prithee pretty York who told thee thisgrandam his nursehis nurse why she was dead ere thou wast bornif itwere not she I cannot tell who told mea parlous boy go to you are too shrewdgood madam be not angry with the childpitchers have earshere comes a messenger what newssuch news my lord as grieves me to reporthow doth the princewell madam and in healthwhat is thy newslord Rivers and lord Grey are sent to Pomfretwith them sir Thomas Vaughan prisonerswho hath committed themthe mighty dukesgloucester and Buckinghamfor what offencethe sum of all I can I have disclosedwhy or for what the nobles were committedis all unknown to me my gracious lordah me I see the ruin of my housethe tiger now hath seized the gentle hindinsulting tyranny begins to jetupon the innocent and aweless thronewelcome destruction death and massacreI see as in a map the end of allaccursed and unquiet wrangling dayshow many of you have mine eyes beheldmy husband lost his life to get the crownand often up and down my sons were tossedfor me to joy and weep their gain and lossand being seated and domestic broilsclean over-blown themselves the conquerorsmake war upon themselves brother to brotherblood to blood self against self O preposterousand frantic outrage end thy damned spleenor let me die to look on death no morecome come my boy we will to sanctuarymadam farewellstay I will go with youyou have no causemy gracious lady goand thither bear your treasure and your goodsfor my part iull resign unto your gracethe seal I keep and so betide to meas well I tender you and all of yourscome iull conduct you to the sanctuarywelcome sweet prince to London to your chamberwelcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereignthe weary way hath made you melancholyno uncle but our crosses on the wayhave made it tedious wearisome and heavyI want more uncles here to welcome mesweet prince the untainted virtue of your yearshath not yet dived into the worlds deceitno more can you distinguish of a manthan of his outward show which God he knowsseldom or never jumpeth with the heartthose uncles which you want were dangerousyour grace attended to their sugared wordsbut looked not on the poison of their heartsgod keep you from them and from such false friendsgod keep me from false friends but they were nonemy lord the mayor of London comes to greet yougod bless your grace with health and happy daysI thank you good my lord and thank you allI thought my mother and my brother Yorkwould long ere this have met us on the wayfie what a slug is hastings that he comes notto tell us whether they will come or noand in good time here comes the sweating lordwelcome my lord what will our mother comeon what occasion God he knows not Ithe queen your mother and your brother Yorkhave taken sanctuary the tender princewould fain have come with me to meet your gracebut by his mother was perforce withheldfie what an indirect and peevish courseis this of hers lord Cardinal will your gracepersuade the queen to send the duke of Yorkunto his princely brother presentlyif she deny lord hastings go with himand from her jealous arms pluck him perforcemy lord of Buckingham if my weak oratorycan from his mother win the duke of Yorkanon expect him here but if she be obdurateto mild entreaties God in heaven forbidwe should infringe the holy privilegeof blessed sanctuary not for all this landwould I be guilty of so great a sinyou are too senseless-obstinate my lordtoo ceremonious and traditionalweigh it but with the grossness of this ageyou break not sanctuary in seizing himthe benefit thereof is always grantedto those whose dealings have deserved the placeand those who have the wit to claim the placethis prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved itand therefore in mine opinion cannot have itthen taking him from thence that is not thereyou break no privilege nor charter thereoft have I heard of sanctuary menbut sanctuary children neer till nowmy lord you shall oer-rule my mind for oncecome on lord hastings will you go with meI go my lordgood lords make all the speedy haste you maysay uncle Gloucester if our brother comewhere shall we sojourn till our coronationwhere it seems best unto your royal selfif I may counsel you some day or twoyour highness shall repose you at the Towerthen where you please and shall be thought most fitfor your best health and recreationI do not like the Tower of any placedid Julius Ceasar build that place my lordhe did my gracious lord begin that placewhich since succeeding ages have re-edifiedis it upon record or else reportedsuccessively from age to age he built itupon record my gracious lordbut say my lord it were not registeredmethinks the truth should live from age to ageas itwere retailed to all posterityeven to the general all-ending dayso wise so young they say do never live longwhat say you uncleI say without characters fame lives longthus like the formal Vice IniquityI moralize two meanings in one wordthat Julius Ceasar was a famous manwith what his valour did enrich his withis wit set down to make his valour livedeath makes no conquest of this conquerorfor now he lives in fame though not in lifeiull tell you what my cousin Buckinghamwhat my gracious lordan if I live until I be a maniull win our anent right in France againor die a soldier as I lived a kingshort summers lightly have a forward springnow in good time here comes the duke of Yorkrichard of York how fares our loving brotherwell my dread lord so must I call you noway brother to our grief as it is yourstoo late he died that might have kept that titlewhich by his death hath lost much majestyhow fares our cousin noble lord of YorkI thank you gentle uncle O my lordyou said that idle weeds are fast in growththe prince my brother hath outgrown me farhe hath my lordand therefore is he idleO my fair cousin I must not say sothen he is more beholding to you than Ihe may command me as my sovereignbut you have power in me as in a kinsmanI pray you uncle give me this daggermy dagger little cousin with all my hearta beggar brotherof my kind uncle that I know will giveand being but a toy which is no grief to givea greater gift than that iull give my cousina greater gift O thats the sword to itay gentle cousin were it light enoughO then I see youll part but with light giftsin weightier things youll say a beggar nayit is too weighty for your grace to wearI weigh it lightly were it heavierwhat would you have my weapon little lordI would that I might thank you as you call mehowlittlemy lord of York will still be cross in talkuncle your grace knows how to bear with himyou mean to bear me not to bear with meuncle my brother mocks both you and mebecause that I am little like an apehe thinks that you should bear me on your shoulderswith what a sharp provided with he reasonsto mitigate the scorn he gives his unclehe prettily and aptly taunts himselfso cunning and so young is wonderfulmy lord willit please you pass alongmyself and my good cousin Buckinghamwill to your mother to entreat of herto meet you at the Tower and welcome youwhat will you go unto the Tower my lordmy lord Protector needs will have it soI shall not sleep in quiet at the Towerwhy what would you fearmarry my uncle Clarence angry ghostmy grandam told me he was murdered thereI fear no uncles deadnor none that live I hopean if they live I hope I need not fearbut come my lord and with a heavy heartthinking on them go I unto the Towerthink you my lord this little prating Yorkwas not incensed by his subtle motherto taunt and scorn you thus opprobriouslyno doubt no doubt O itis a parlous boybold quick ingenious forward capablehes all the mothers from the top to toewell let them rest come hither Catesby thou art swornas deeply to effect what we intendas closely to conceal what we impartthou knowest our reasons urged upon the waywhat thinkest thou is it not an easy matterto make William lord hastings of our mindfor the instalment of this noble dukein the seat royal of this famous islehe for his fathers sake so loves the princethat he will not be won to aught against himwhat thinkest thou then of Stanley what will hehe will do all in all as hastings dothwell then no more but this go gentle Catesbyand as it were far off sound thou lord hastingshow he doth stand affected to our purposeand summon him to-morrow to the Towerto sit about the coronationif thou dost find him tractable to usencourage him and tell him all our reasonsif he be leaden icy-cold unwillingbe thou so too and so break off the talkand give us notice of his inclinationfor we to-morrow hold divided counlswherein thyself shalt highly be employedcommend me to lord William tell him Catesbyhis anent knot of dangerous adversariesto-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castleand bid my lord for joy of this good newsgive mistress Shore one gentle kiss the moregood Catesby go effect this business soundlymy good lords both with all the heed I canshall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleepyou shall my lordat Crosby-place there shall you find us bothnow my lord what shall we do if we perceivelord hastings will not yield to our complotschop off his head something we will determineand look when I am king claim thou of methe earldom of Hereford and all the moveableswhereof the king my brother stood possessediull claim that promise at your graces handand look to have it yielded with all kindnesscome let us sup betimes that afterwardswe may digest our complots in some formmy lord my lordwho knocksone from the lord Stanleywhat isit oclockupon the stroke of fourcannot my lord Stanley sleep these tedious nightsso it appears by that I have to sayfirst he commends him to your noble selfwhat thenthen certifies your lordship that this nighthe dreamt the boar had razed off his helmbesides he says there are two counls heldand that may be determined at the onewhich may make you and him to rue at the othertherefore he sends to know your lordships pleasureif you will presently take horse with himand with all speed post with him towards the northto shun the danger that his soul divinesgo fellow go return unto thy lordbid him not fear the separated counlshis honour and myself are at the oneand at the other is my good friend Catesbywhere nothing can proceed that toucheth uswhereof I shall not have intelligencetell him his fears are shallow wanting instanceand for his dreams I wonder hes so fondto trust the mockery of unquiet slumbersto fly the boar before the boar pursueswere to incense the boar to follow usand make pursuit where he did mean no chasego bid thy master rise and come to meand we will both together to the Towerwhere he shall see the boar will use us kindlyiull go my lord and tell him what you saymany good morrows to my noble lordgood morrow Catesby you are early stirringwhat news what news in this our tottering stateit is a reeling world indeed my lordand I believe will never stand uprighttill Richard wear the garland of the realmhow wear the garland dost thou mean the crownay my good lordiull have this crown of mine cut from my shouldersbefore iull see the crown so foul misplacedbut canst thou guess that he doth aim at itay on my life and hopes to find you forwardupon his party for the gain thereofand thereupon he sends you this good newsthat this same very day your enemiesthe kindred of the queen must die at Pomfretindeed I am no mourner for that newsbecause they have been still my adversariesbut that iull give my voice on Richards sideto bar my masters heirs in true descentgod knows I will not do it to the deathgod keep your lordship in that gracious mindbut I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hencethat they which brought me in my masters hateI live to look upon their tragedywell Catesby ere a fortnight make me olderiull send some packing that yet think not onititis a vile thing to die my gracious lordwhen men are unprepared and look not for itO monstrous monstrous and so falls it outwith Rivers Vaughan Grey and so itwill dowith some men else who think themselves as safeas thou and I who as thou knowest are dearto princely Richard and to Buckinghamthe princes both make high account of youfor they account his head upon the bridgeI know they do and I have well deserved itcome on come on where is your boar-spear manfear you the boar and go so unprovidedmy lord good morrow good morrow Catesbyyou may jest on but by the holy roodI do not like these several counls Imy lord I hold my life as dear as you do yoursand never in my days I do protestwas it so precious to me as itis nowthink you but that I know our state secureI would be so triumphant as I amthe lords at Pomfret when they rode from Londonwere jocund and supposed their state was sureand they indeed had no cause to mistrustbut yet you see how soon the day oercastthis sudden stab of rancour I misdoubtpray God I say I prove a needless cowardwhat shall we toward the Tower the day is spentcome come have with you Wot you what my lordto-day the lords you talk of are beheadedthey for their truth might better wear their headsthan some that have accused them wear their hatsbut come my lord lets awaygo on before iull talk with this good fellowhow now sirrah how goes the world with theethe better that your lordship please to askI tell thee man itis better with me nowthan when I met thee last where now we

deathand for more slander to thy dismal seatwe give thee up our guitless blood to drinknow Margarets curse is falln upon our headswhen she exclaimed on hastings you and Ifor standing by when Richard stabbed her sonthen cursed she Richard then cursed she Buckinghamthen cursed she hastings O remember Godto hear her prayer for them as now for usand for my sister and her princely sonsbe

faces for our heartshe knows no more of mine than I of yoursnor I of his my lord than you of minelord hastings you and he are near in loveI thank his grace I know he loves me wellbut for his purpose in the coronationI have not sounded him nor he deliveredhis gracious pleasure any way thereinbut you my noble lords may name the timeand in the dukes behalf iull give my voicewhich I presume hell take in gentle partin happy time here comes the duke himselfmy noble lords and cousins all good morrowI have been long a sleeper but I trustmy absence doth neglect no great designwhich by my presence might have been concludedhad you not come upon your cue my lordwilliam lord hastings had pronounced your partI mean your voice for crowning of the kingthan my lord hastings no man might be bolderhis lordship knows me well and loves me wellmy lord of Ely when I was last in HolbornI saw good strawberries in your garden thereI do beseech you send for some of themmarry and will my lord with all my heartcousin of Buckingham a word with youcatesby hath sounded hastings in our businessand finds the testy gentleman so hotthat he will lose his head ere give consenthis masters child as worshipfully he terms itshall lose the royalty of Englands thronewithdraw yourself a while iull go with youwe have not yet set down this day of triumphto-morrow in my judgment is too suddenfor I myself am not so well providedas else I would be were the day prolongedwhere is my lord the duke of GloucesterI have sent for these strawberrieshis grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morningtheres some conceit or other likes him wellwhen that he bids good morrow with such spiritI think theres never a man in Christendomcan lesser hide his hate or love than hefor by his face straight shall you know his heartwhat of his heart perceived you in his faceby any livelihood he showed to-daymarry that with no man here he is offendedfor were he he had shown it in his looksI pray you all tell me what they deservethat do conspire my death with devilish plotsof damned witchcraft and that have prevailedupon my body with their hellish charmsthe tender love I bear your grace my lordmakes me most forward in this princely presenceto doom th offenders whosoeer they beI say my lord they have deserved deaththen be your eyes the witness of their evillook how I am bewitched behold mine armis like a blasted sapling withered upand this is Edwards wife that monstrous witchconsorted with that harlot strumpet Shorethat by their witchcraft thus have marked meif they have done this thing my noble lordif thou protector of this damned strumpettalkest thou to me of ifs thou art a traitoroff with his head now by Saint Paul I swearI will not dine until I see the samelovel and Ratcliff look that it be donethe rest that love me rise and follow mewoe woe for England not a whit for mefor I too fond might have prevented thisstanley did dream the boar did raze his helmand I did scorn it and disdained to flythree times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumbleand startled when he looked upon the Toweras loath to bear me to the slaughter-houseO now I need the priest that spake to meI now repent I told the pursuivantas too triumphing how mine enemiesto-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcheredand I myself secure in grace and favourO Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curseis lighted on poor hastings wretched headcome come dispatch the duke would be at dinnermake a short shrift he longs to see your headO momentary grace of mortal manwhich we more hunt for than the grace of Godwho builds his hope in air of your good lookslives like a drunken sailor on a mastready with every nod to tumble downinto the fatal bowels of the deepcome come dispatch itis bootless to exclaimO bloody Richard miserable EnglandI prophesy the fearfullest time to theethat ever wretched age hath looked uponcome lead me to the block bear him my headthey smile at me who shortly shall be deadcome cousin canst thou quake and change thy colourmurder thy breath in middle of a wordand then again begin and stop againas if thou wert distraught and mad with terrortut I can counterfeit the deep tragedianspeak and look back and pry on every sidetremble and start at wagging of a strawintending deep suspion ghastly looksare at my service like enforced smilesand both are ready in their officesat any time to grace my stratagemsbut what is Catesby gonehe is and see he brings the mayor alonglord mayorlook to the drawbridge therehark a drumcatesby oerlook the wallslord mayor the reason we have sentlook back defend thee here are enemiesgod and our innocency defend and guard usbe patient they are friends Ratcliff and lovelhere is the head of that ignoble traitorthe dangerous and unsuspected hastingsso dear I loved the man that I must weepI took him for the plainest harmless creaturethat breathed upon the earth a christianmade him my book wherein my soul recordedthe history of all her secret thoughtsso smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtuethat his apparent open guilt omittedI mean his conversation with Shores wifehe lived from all attainder of suspectwell well he was the covertest sheltered traitorthat ever livedwould you imagine or almost believewereit not that by great preservationwe live to tell it that the subtle traitorthis day had plotted in the counl-houseto murder me and my good lord of Gloucesterhad he done sowhat think you we are Turks or infidelsor that we would against the form of lawproceed thus rashly in the villains deathbut that the extreme peril of the casethe peace of England and our persons safetyenforced us to this executionnow fair befall you he deserved his deathand your good graces both have well proceededto warn false traitors from the like attemptsI never looked for better at his handsafter he once fell in with mistress Shoreyet had we not determined he should dieuntil your lordship came to see his endwhich now the loving haste of these our friendssomething against our meaning hath preventedbecause my lord we would have had you heardthe traitor speak and timorously confessthe manner and the purpose of his treasonthat you might well have signified the sameunto the tizens who haply maymisconster us in him and wail his deathbut my good lord your graces word shall serveas well as I had seen and heard him speakand do not doubt right noble princes bothbut iull acquaint our duteous tizenswith all your just proceedings in this causeand to that end we wished your lordship hereto avoid the censures of the carping worldbut since you come too late of our intentyet witness what you hear we did intendand so my good lord mayor we bid farewellgo after after cousin Buckinghamthe mayor towards guildhall hies him in all postthere at your meetest vantage of the timeinfer the bastardy of Edwards childrentell them how Edward put to death a tizenonly for saying he would make his sonheir to the crown meaning indeed his housewhich by the sign thereof was termed somoreover urge his hateful luxuryand bestial appetite in change of lustwhich stretched unto their servants daughters wiveseven where his raging eye or savage heartwithout control lusted to make a preynay for a need thus far come near my persontell them when that my mother went with childof that insatiate Edward noble Yorkmy princely father then had wars in Franceand by true computation of the timefound that the issue was not his begotwhich well appeared in his lineamentsbeing nothing like the noble duke my fatheryet touch this sparingly as itwere far offbecause my lord you know my mother livesdoubt not my lord iull play the oratoras if the golden fee for which I pleadwere for myself and so my lord adieuif you thrive well bring them to Baynards Castlewhere you shall find me well accompaniedwith reverend fathers and well-learned bishopsI go and towards three or four oclocklook for the news that the guildhall affordsgo lovel with all speed to Doctor Shawgo thou to Friar Penker bid them bothmeet me within this hour at Baynards Castlenow will I in to take some privy orderto draw the brats of Clarence out of sightand to give notice that no manner personhave any time recourse unto the princeshere is the indictment of the good lord hastingswhich in a set hand fairly is engrossedthat it may be to-day read oer in Paulsand mark how well the sequel hangs togethereleven hours I have spent to write it overfor yesternight by Catesby was it sent methe precedent was full as long a-doingand yet within these five hours hastings liveduntainted unexamined free at libertyheres a good world the while who is so grossthat cannot see this palpable deviceyet who so bold but says he sees it notbad is the world and all will come to naughtwhen such ill dealing must be seen in thoughthow now how now what say the tizensnow by the holy mother of our lordthe tizens are mum say not a wordtouched you the bastardy of Edwards childrenI did with his contract with Lady Lucyand his contract by deputy in Francethe insatiate greediness of his desiresand his enforcement of the ty wiveshis tyranny for trifles his own bastardyas being got your father then in Franceand his resemblance being not like the dukewithal I did infer your lineamentsbeing the right idea of your fatherboth in your form and nobleness of mindlaid open all your victories in Scotlandyour displine in war wisdom in peaceyour bounty virtue fair humilityindeed left nothing fitting for your purposeuntouched or slightly handled in discourseand when my oratory drew toward endI bade them that did love their countrys goodcry God save Richard Englands royal king and did they sono so God help me they spake not a wordbut like dumb statuas or breathing stonesstared each on other and looked deadly palewhich when I saw I reprehended themand asked the mayor what meant this wilful silencehis answer was the people were not wontto be spoke to but by the recorderthen he was urged to tell my tale againthus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferred but nothing spoke in warrant from himselfwhen he had done some followers of mine ownat lower end of the hall hurled up their capsand some ten voices cried God save king Richard and thus I took the vantage of those fewthanks gentle tizens and friends quoth Ithis general applause and cheerful shoutargues your wisdom and your love to Richard and even here brake off and came awaywhat tongueless blocks were they would they not speakwill not the mayor then and his brethren comethe mayor is here at hand Intend some fearbe not you spoke with but by mighty suitand look you get a prayer-book in your handand stand between two churchmen good my lordfor on that ground iull make a holy descantand be not easily won to our requestsplay the maids part still answer nay and take itI go and if you plead as well for themas I can say nay to thee for myselfno doubt we bring it to a happy issuego go up to the leads the lord mayor knockswelcome my lord I dance attendance hereI think the duke will not be spoke withalnow Catesby what says your lord to my requesthe doth entreat your grace my noble lordto visit him to-morrow or next dayhe is within with two right reverend fathersdivinely bent to meditationand in no worldly suit would he be movedto draw him from his holy exersereturn good Catesby to the gracious duketell him myself the mayor and aldermenin deep designs in matter of great momentno less importing than our general goodare come to have some conference with his graceiull signify so much unto him straightah ha my lord this prince is not an Edwardhe is not lolling on a lewd day-bedbut on his knees at meditationnot dallying with a brace of courtezansbut meditating with two deep divinesnot sleeping to engross his idle bodybut praying to enrich his watchful soulhappy were England would this virtuous princetake on his grace the sovereignty thereofbut sore I fear we shall not win him to itmarry God defend his grace should say us nayI fear he will here Catesby comes againnow Catesby what says his gracehe wonders to what end you have assembledsuch troops of tizens to come to himhis grace not being warned thereof beforemy lord he fears you mean no good to himsorry I am my noble cousin shouldsuspect me that I mean no good to himby heaven we come to him in perfect loveand so once more return and tell his gracewhen holy and devout religious menare at their beads itis much to draw them thenceso sweet is zealous contemplationsee where his grace stands btween two clergymentwo props of virtue for a christian princeto stay him from the fall of vanityand see a book of prayer in his handtrue ornament to know a holy manfamous Plantagenet most gracious princelend favourable ear to our requestsand pardon us the interruptionof thy devotion and right christian zealmy lord there needs no such apologyI do beseech your grace to pardon mewho earnest in the service of my Goddeferred the visitation of my friendsbut leaving this what is your graces pleasureeven that I hope which pleaseth God aboveand all good men of this ungoverned isleI do suspect I have done some offencethat seems disgracious in the tys eyeand that you come to reprehend my ignoranceyou have my lord would it might please your graceon our entreaties to amend your faultelse wherefore breathe I in a christian landknow then it is your fault that you resignthe supreme seat the throne majesticalthe sceptred office of your ancestorsyour state of fortune and your due of birththe lineal glory of your royal houseto the corruption of a blemished stockwhiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughtswhich here we waken to our countrys goodthis noble isle doth want her proper limbsher face defaced with scars of infamyher royal stock graft with ignoble plantsand almost shouldered in the swallowing gulfof dark forgetfulness and deep oblivionwhich to recure we heartily solityour gracious self to take on you the chargeand kingly government of this your landnot as protector steward substituteor lowly factor for anothers gainbut as successively from blood to bloodyour right of birth your empery your ownfor this consorted with the tizensyour very worshipful and loving friendsand by their vehement instigationin this just cause come I to move your graceI cannot tell if to depart in silenceor bitterly to speak in your reproofbest fitteth my degree or your conditionif not to answer you might haply thinktongue-tied ambition not replying yieldedto bear the golden yoke of sovreigntywhich fondly you would here impose on meif to reprove you for this suit of yoursso seasoned with your faithful love to methen on the other side I checked my friendstherefore to speak and to avoid the firstand then in speaking not to incur the lastdefinitively thus I answer youyour love deserves my thanks but my desertunmeritable shuns your high requestfirst if all obstacles were cut awayand that my path were even to the crownas the ripe revenue and due of birthyet so much is my poverty of spiritso mighty and so many my defectsthat I would rather hide me from my greatnessbeing a bark to brook no mighty seathan in my greatness covet to be hidand in the vapour of my glory smotheredbut God be thanked there is no need of meand much I need to help you were there needthe royal tree hath left us royal fruitwhich mellowed by the stealing hours of timewill well become the seat of majestyand make no doubt us happy by his reignon him I lay that you would lay on methe right and fortune of his happy starswhich God defend that I should wring from himmy lord this argues consence in your gracebut the respects thereof are nice and trivialall rcumstances well consideredyou say that Edward is your brothers sonso say we too but not by Edwards wifefor first was he contract to Lady Lucyyour mother lives a witness to his vowand afterward by substitute betrothedto Bona sister to the king of Francethese both put by a poor petitionera care-crazed mother to a many sonsa beauty-waning and distressed widoweven in the afternoon of her best daysmade prize and purchase of his wanton eyeseduced the pitch and height of his degreeto base declension and loathed bigamyby her in his unlawful bed he gotthis Edward whom our manners call the princemore bitterly could I expostulatesave that for reverence to some aliveI give a sparing limit to my tonguethen good my lord take to your royal selfthis proffered benefit of dignityif not to bless us and the land withalyet to draw forth your noble ancestryfrom the corruption of abusing timesunto a lineal true-derived coursedo good my lord your tizens entreat yourefuse not mighty lord this proffered loveO make them joyful grant their lawful suitalas why would you heap those cares on meI am unfit for state and majestyI do beseech you take it not amissI cannot nor I will not yield to youif you refuse it as in love and zealloath to depose the child your brothers sonas well we know your tenderness of heartand gentle kind effeminate remorsewhich we have noted in you to your kindredand egally indeed to all estatesyet whether you accept our suit or noyour brothers son shall never reign our kingbut we will plant some other in the throneto the disgrace and downfall of your houseand in this resolution here we leave youcome tizens we will entreat no morecall them again sweet prince accept their suitif you deny them all the land will rue itwill you enforce me to a world of carescall them again I am not made of stonebut penetrable to your kind entreatsalbeit against my consence and my soulcousin of Buckingham and sage grave mensince you will buckle fortune on my backto bear her burden wher I will or noI must have patience to endure the loadbut if black scandal or foul-faced reproachattend the sequel of your impositionyour mere enforcement shall acquittance mefrom all the impure blots and stains thereoffor God doth know and you may partly seehow far I am from the desire of thisgod bless your grace we see it and will say itin saying so you shall but say the truththen I salute you with this royal titlelong live king Richard Englands worthy kingamento-morrow may it please you to be crownedeven when you please for you will have it soto-morrow then we will attend your graceand so most joyfully we take our leavecome let us to our holy work againfarewell my cousin farewell gentle friendswho meets us here my niece Plantagenetled in the hand of

browwere red-hot steel to sear me to the brainanointed let me be with deadly venomand die ere men can say God save the queen go go poor soul I envy not thy gloryto feed my humour wish thyself no harmno why when he that is my husband nowcame to me as I followed Henrys corsewhen scarce the blood was well washed from his handswhich issued from my other angel husbandand that dead saint which then I weeping followedO when I say I looked on Richards facethis was my wish be thou quoth I accursedfor making me so young so old a widowand when thou weddest let sorrow haunt thy bedand be thy wife if any be so madmore miserable by the life of theethan thou hast made me by my dear lords death lo ere I can repeat this curse againwithin so small a time my womans heartgrossly grew captive to his honey wordsand proved the subject of mine own souls cursewhich hitherto hath held mine eyes from restfor never yet one hour in his beddid I enjoy the golden dew of sleepbut with his timorous dreams was still awakedbesides he hates me for my father Warwickand will no doubt shortly be rid of mepoor heart adieu I pity thy complainingno more than with my soul I mourn for yoursfarewell thou woeful welcomer of gloryadieu poor soul that takest thy leave of itgo thou to Richmond and good fortune guide theego thou to Richard and good angels tend theego thou to

livestrue noble princeO bitter consequencethat Edward still should live true noble prince cousin thou wast not wont to be so dullshall I be plain I wish the bastards deadand I would have it suddenly performedwhat sayst thou now speak suddenly be briefyour grace may do your pleasuretut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezessay have I thy consent that they shall diegive me some little breath some pause dear lordbefore I positively speak in thisI will resolve you herein presentlythe king is angry see he gnaws his lipI will converse with iron-witted foolsand unrespective boys none are for methat look into me with considerate eyeshigh-reaching Buckingham grows rcumspectboymy lordknowest thou not any whom corrupting goldwill tempt unto a close exploit of deathI know a discontented gentlemanwhose humble means match not his haughty spiritgold were as good as twenty oratorsand will no doubt tempt him to anythingwhat is his namehis name my lord is TyrrellI partly know the man go call him hitherthe deep-revolving witty Buckinghamno more shall be the neighbour to my counselhath he so long held out with me untiredand stops he now for breath well be it sohow now lord Stanley whats the newsknow my loving lordthe Marquess Dorset as I hear is fledto Richmond in the parts where he abidescome hither Catesby rumour it abroadthat Anne my wife is very grievous sickI will take order for her keeping closeinquire me out some mean poor gentlemanwhom I will marry straight to Clarence daughterthe boy is foolish and I fear not himlook how thou dreamest I say again give outthat Anne my queen is sick and like to dieabout it for it stands me much uponto stop all hopes whose growth may damage meI must be married to my brothers daughteror else my kingdom stands on brittle glassmurder her brothers and then marry heruncertain way of gain but I am inso far in blood that sin will pluck on sintear-falling pity dwells not in this eyeis thy name Tyrrelljames Tyrrell and your most obedient subjectart thou indeedprove me my gracious lorddarest thou resolve to kill a friend of mineplease you but I had rather kill two enemieswhy then thou hast it two deep enemiesfoes to my rest and my sweet sleeps disturbersare they that I would have thee deal upontyrrell I mean those bastards in the Towerlet me have open means to come to themand soon iull rid you from the fear of themthou singest sweet music hark come hither Tyrrellgo by this token rise and lend thine earthere is no more but so say it is doneand I will love thee and prefer thee for itI will dispatch it straightmy lord I have considered in my mindthe late demand that you did sound me inwell let that rest Dorset is fled to RichmondI hear the news my lordstanley he is your wifes son well look to itmy lord I claim the gift my due by promisefor which your honour and your faith is pawnedthe earldom of Hereford and the moveableswhich you have promised I shall possessstanley look to your wife if she conveyletters to Richmond you shall answer itwhat says your highness to my just requestI do remember me Henry the Sixthdid prophesy that Richmond should be kingwhen Richmond was a little peevish boya king perhapsmy lordhow chance the prophet could not at that timehave told me I being by that I should kill himmy lord your promise for the earldomrichmond when last I was at Exeterthe mayor in courtesy showed me the castleand called it Rougemont at which name I startedbecause a bard of Ireland told me onceI should not live long after I saw Richmondmy lorday whats oclockI am thus bold to put your grace in mindof what you promised mewell but what isit oclockupon the stroke of tenwell let it strikewhy let it strikebecause that like a Jack thou keepest the strokebetwixt thy begging and my meditationI am not in the giving vein to-daywhy then resolve me wher you will or nothou troublest me I am not in the veinand is it thus repays he my deep servicewith such contempt made I him king for thisO let me think on hastings and be goneto Brecknock while my fearful head is onthe tyrannous and bloody act is donethe most arch deed of piteous massacrethat ever yet this land was guilty ofdighton and forrest whom I did subornto do this piece of ruthless butcheryalbeit they were fleshed villains bloody dogsmelting with tenderness and mild compassionwept like to children in their deaths sad storyoh thus quoth Dighton lay the gentle babes thus thus quoth forrest girdling one anotherwithin their alabaster innocent armstheir lips were four red roses on a stalkwhich in their summer beauty kissed each othera book of prayers on their pillow laywhich once quoth forrest almost changed my mindbut O the devil there the villain stoppedwhen Dighton thus told on we smotheredthe most replenished sweet work of naturethat from the prime creation eer she framed hence both are gone with consence and remorsethey could not speak and so I left them bothto bear this tidings to the bloody kingand here he comesall health my sovereign lordkind Tyrrell am I happy in thy newsif to have done the thing you gave in chargebeget your happiness be happy thenfor it is donebut didst thou see them deadI did my lordand buried gentle Tyrrellthe chaplain of the Tower hath buried thembut how or in what place I do not knowcome to me Tyrrell soon at after-supperwhen thou shalt tell the process of their deathmeantime but think how I may do thee goodand be inheritor of thy desirefarewell till thenI humbly take my leavethe son of Clarence have I pent up closehis daughter meanly have I matched in marriagethe sons of Edward sleep in Abrahams bosomand Anne my wife hath bid the world good nightnow for I know the Breton Richmond aimsat young Elizabeth my brothers daughterand by that knot looks proudly on the crownto her go I a jolly thriving wooermy lordgood or bad news that thou comest in so bluntlybad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmondand Buckingham backed with the hardy Welshmenis in the field and still his power increasethely with Richmond troubles me more nearthan Buckingham and his rash-levied strengthcome I have learned that fearful commentingis leaden servitor to dull delaydelay leads impotent and snail-paced beggarythen fiery expedition be my wingjoves Mercury and herald for a kinggo muster men my counsel is my shieldwe must be brief when traitors brave the fieldso now prosperity begins to mellowand drop into the rotten mouth of deathhere in these confines slily have I lurkedto watch the waning of mine enemiesa dire induction am I witness toand will to France hoping the consequencewill prove as bitter black and tragicalwithdraw thee wretched Margaret who comes hereah my poor princes ah my tender babesmy unblown flowers new-appearing sweetsif yet your gentle souls fly in the airand be not fixed in doom perpetualhover about me with your airy wingsand hear your mothers lamentationhover about her say that right for righthath dimmed your infant morn to aged nightso many miseries have crazed my voicethat my woe-wearied tongue is still and muteedward Plantagenet why art thou deadplantagenet doth quit Plantagenetedward for Edward pays a dying debtwilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambsand throw them in the entrails of the wolfwhen didst thou sleep when such a deed was donewhen holy Harry died and my sweet sondead life blind sight poor mortal living ghostwoes scene worlds shame graves due by life usurpedbrief abstract and record of tedious daysrest thy unrest on Englands lawful earthunlawfully made drunk with innocent bloodah that thou wouldst as soon afford a graveas thou canst yield a melancholy seatthen would I hide my bones not rest them hereah who hath any cause to mourn but Iif anent sorrow be most reverendgive mine the benefit of senioryand let my griefs frown on the upper handif sorrow can admit societytell oer your woes again by viewing mineI had an Edward till a Richard killed himI had a Harry till a Richard killed himthou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed himthou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed himI had a Richard too and thou didst kill himI had a Rutland too thou holpest to kill himthou hadst a Clarence too and Richard killed himfrom forth the kennel of thy womb hath crepta hellhound that doth hunt us all to deaththat dog that had his teeth before his eyesto worry lambs and lap their gentle bloodthat foul defacer of Gods handiworkthat excellent grand-tyrant of the earththat reigns in galled eyes of weeping soulsthy womb let loose to chase us to our gravesO upright just and true-disposing Godhow do I thank thee that this carnal curpreys on the issue of his mothers bodyand makes her pew-fellow with others moanO Harrys wife triumph not in my woesgod witness with me I have wept for thinebear with me I am hungry for revengeand now I cloy me with beholding itthy Edward he is dead that killed my Edwardthy other Edward dead to quit my Edwardyoung York he is but boot because both theymatch not the high perfection of my lossthy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edwardand the beholders of this tragic playthe adulterate hastings Rivers Vaughan Greyuntimely smothered in their dusky gravesrichard yet lives hells black intelligenceronly reserved their factor to buy soulsand send them thither but at hand at handensues his piteous and unpitied endearth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints prayto have him suddenly conveyed from hencecancel his bond of life dear God I praythat I may live to say the dog is deadO thou didst prophesy the time would comethat I should wish for thee to help me cursethat bottled spider that foul bunchbacked toadI called thee then vain flourish of my fortuneI called thee then poor shadow painted queenthe presentation of but what I wasthe flattering index of a direful pageantone heaved a-high to be hurled down belowa mother only mocked with two fair babesa dream of what thou wert a breath a bubblea sign of dignity a garish flagto be the aim of every dangerous shota queen in jest only to fill the scenewhere is thy husband now where be thy brotherswhere are thy children wherein dost thou joywho sues and kneels and cries God save the queenwhere be the bending peers that flattered theewhere be the thronging troops that followed theedecline all this and see what now thou artfor happy wife a most distressed widowfor joyful mother one that wails the namefor one being sued to one that humbly suesfor queen a very caitiff crowned with carefor one that scorned at me now scorned of mefor one being feared of all now fearing onefor one commanding all obeyed of nonethus hath the course of justice whirled aboutand left thee but a very prey to timehaving no more but thought of what thou wertto torture thee the more being what thou artthou didst usurp my place and dost thou notusurp the just proportion of my sorrownow thy proud neck bears half my burdened yokefrom which even here I slip my wearied headand leave the burden of it all on theefarewell Yorks wife and queen of sad mischancethese English woes shall make me smile in FranceO thou well skilled in curses stay awhileand teach me how to curse mine enemiesforbear to sleep the night and fast the daycompare dead happiness with living woethink that thy babes were fairer than they wereand he that slew them fouler than he isbettering thy loss makes the bad causer worserevolving this will teach thee how to cursemy words are dull O quicken them with thinethy woes will make them sharp and pierce like minewhy should calamity be full of wordswindy attorneys to their client woesairy succeeders of intestate joyspoor breathing orators of miserieslet them have scope though what they do imparthelp nothing else yet do they ease the heartif so then be not tongue-tied go with meand in the breath of bitter words lets smothermy damned son that thy two sweet sons smotheredthe trumpet sounds be copious in exclaimswho intercepts me in my expeditionO she that might have intercepted theeby strangling thee in her accursed wombfrom all the slaughters wretch that thou hast donehidest thou that forehead with a golden crownwhere should be branded if that right were rightthe slaughter of the prince that owed that crownand the dire death of my poor sons and brotherstell me thou villain slave where are my childrenthou toad thou toad where is thy brother Clarenceand little Ned Plantagenet his sonwhere is the gentle Rivers Vaughan Greywhere is kind hastingsa flourish trumpets strike alarum drumslet not the heavens hear these tell-tale womenrail on the lords anointed Strike I sayeither be patient and entreat me fairor with the clamorous report of warthus will I drown your exclamationsart thou my sonay I thank God my father and yourselfthen patiently hear my impatiencemadam I have a touch of your conditionthat cannot brook the accent of reproofO let me speakdo then but iull not hearI will be mild and gentle in my wordsand brief good mother for I am in hasteart thou so hasty I have stayed for theegod knows in torment and in agonyand came I not at last to comfort youno by the holy rood thou knowest it wellthou camest on earth to make the earth my hella grievous burden was thy birth to metetchy and wayward was thy infancythy school-days frightful desperate wild and furiousthy prime of manhood daring bold and venturousthy age confirmed proud subtle sly and bloodymore mild but yet more harmful kind in hatredwhat comfortable hour canst thou namethat ever graced me in thy companyfaith none but Humphrey Hour that called your graceto breakfast once forth of my companyif I be so disgracious in your eyelet me march on and not offend you madamstrike up the drumI prithee hear me speakyou speak too bitterlyhear me a wordfor I shall never speak to thee againsoeither thou wilt die by Gods just ordinanceere from this war thou turn a conqueroror I with grief and extreme age shall perishand never look upon thy face againtherefore take with thee my most grievous cursewhich in the day of battle tire thee morethan all the complete armour that thou wearestmy prayers on the adverse party fightand there the little souls of Edwards childrenwhisper the spirits of thine enemiesand promise them success and victorybloody thou art bloody will be thy endshame serves thy life and doth thy death attendthough far more cause yet much less spirit to curseabides in me I say amen to herstay madam I must talk a word with youI have no moe sons of the royal bloodfor thee to slaughter for my daughters Richardthey shall be praying nuns not weeping queensand therefore level not to hit their livesyou have a daughter called Elizabethvirtuous and fair royal and graciousand must she die for this O let her liveand iull corrupt her manners stain her beautyslander myself as false to Edwards bedthrow over her the veil of infamyso she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughterI will confess she was not Edwards daughterwrong not her birth she is of royal bloodto save her life iull say she is not soher life is safest only in her birthand only in that safety died her brotherslo at their births good stars were oppositeno to their lives ill friends were contraryall unavoided is the doom of destinytrue when avoided grace makes destinymy babes were destined to a fairer deathif grace had blessed thee with a fairer lifeyou speak as if that I had slain my cousinscousins indeed and by their uncle cozenedof comfort kingdom kindred freedom lifewhose hands soever lanced their tender heartsthy head all indirectly gave directionno doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunttill it was whetted on thy stone-hard heartto revel in the entrails of my lambsbut that still use of grief makes wild grief tamemy tongue should to thy ears not name my boystill that my nails were anchored in thine eyesand I in such a desperate bay of deathlike a poor bark of sails and tackling reftrush all to pieces on thy rocky bosommadam so thrive I in my enterpriseand dangerous success of bloody warsas I intend more good to you and yoursthan ever you or yours by me were harmedwhat good is covered with the face of heavento be discovered that can do me goodthe advancement of your children gentle ladyup to some scaffold there to lose their headsno to the dignity and height of fortunethe high imperial type of this earths gloryflatter my sorrow with report of ittell me what state what dignity what honourcanst thou demise to any child of mineeven all I have ay and myself and allwill I withal endow a child of thineso in the lethe of thy angry soulthou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongswhich thou supposest I have done to theebe brief lest that the process of thy kindnesslast longer telling than thy kindness datethen know that from my soul I love thy daughtermy daughters mother thinks it with her soulwhat do you thinkthat thou dost love my daughter from thy soulso from thy souls love didst thou love her brothersand from my hearts love I do thank thee for itbe not too hasty to confound my meaningI mean that with my soul I love thy daughterand do intend to make her queen of Englandwell then who dost thou mean shall be her kingeven he that makes her queen who else should bewhat thoueven so what think you of ithow canst thou woo herthat I would learn of youas one being best acquainted with her humourand wilt thou learn of memadam with all my heartsend to her by the man that slew her brothersa pair of bleeding hearts thereon engraveedward and York then haply will she weeptherefore present to her as sometime Margaretdid to thy father steeped in Rutlands blooda handkerchief which say to her did drainthe purple sap from her sweet brothers bodyand bid her wipe her weeping eyes withalif this inducement move her not to lovesend her a letter of thy noble deedstell her thou madest away her uncle Clarenceher uncle Rivers ay and for her sakemadest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anneyou mock me madam this is not the wayto win your daughterthere is no other wayunless thou couldst put on some other shapeand not be Richard that hath done all thissay that I did all this for love of hernay then indeed she cannot choose but hate theehaving bought love with such a bloody spoillook what is done cannot be now amendedmen shall deal unadvisedly sometimeswhich after-hours give leisure to repentif I did take the kingdom from your sonsto make amends iull give it to your daughterif I have killed the issue of your wombto quicken your increase I will begetmine issue of your blood upon your daughtera grandams name is little less in lovethan is the doting title of a motherthey are as children but one step beloweven of your mettle of your very bloodof all one pain save for a night of groansendured of her for whom you bid like sorrowyour children were vexation to your youthbut mine shall be a comfort to your agethe loss you have is but a son being kingand by that loss your daughter is made queenI cannot make you what amends I wouldtherefore accept such kindness as I candorset your son that with a fearful soulleads discontented steps in foreign soilthis fair alliance quickly shall call hometo high promotions and great dignitythe king that calls your beauteous daughter wifefamiliarly shall call thy Dorset brotheragain shall you be mother to a kingand all the ruins of distressful timesrepaired with double riches of contentwhat we have many goodly days to seethe liquid drops of tears that you have shedshall come again transformed to orient pearladvantaging their loan with interestof ten times double gain of happinessgo then my mother to thy daughter gomake bold her bashful years with your experienceprepare her ears to hear a wooers taleput in her tender heart the aspiring flameof golden sovereignty acquaint the princesswith the sweet silent hours of marriage joysand when this arm of mine hath chastisedthe petty rebel dull-brained Buckinghambound with triumphant garlands will I comeand lead thy daughter to a conquerors bedto whom I will retail my conquest wonand she shall be sole victress Ceasars Ceasarwhat were I best to say her fathers brotherwould be her lord Or shall I say her uncleor he that slew her brothers and her unclesunder what title shall I woo for theethat God the law my honour and her lovecan make seem pleasing to her tender yearsinfer fair Englands peace by this alliancewhich she shall purchase with still lasting wartell her the king that may command entreatsthat at her hands which the kings king forbidssay she shall be a high and mighty queento wail the title as her mother dothsay I will love her everlastinglybut how long

tonguename Cleopatra as she is called in Romerail thou in Fulvias phrase and taunt my faultswith such full licence as both truth and malicehave power to utter O then we bring forth weedswhen our quick winds lie still and our ills told usis as our earing fare thee well awhileat your noble pleasurefrom Sicyon ho the news speak therethe man from Sicyon is there such an onehe stays upon your willlet him appearthese strong Egyptian fetters I must breakor lose myself in dotagewhat are youFulvia thy wife is deadwhere died shein Sicyonher length of sickness with what else more seriousimporteth thee to know this bearsforbear metheres a great spirit gone thus did I desire itwhat our contempts do often hurl from uswe wish it ours again the present pleasureby revolution lowering does becomethe opposite of itself shes good being gonethe hand could pluck her back that shoved her onI must from this enchanting queen break offten thousand harms more than the ills I knowmy idleness doth hatch how now Enobarbuswhats your pleasure sirI must with haste from hencewhy then we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure deaths the wordI must be goneunder a compelling occasion let women die it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing Cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dyingshe is cunning past mans thoughtalack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a shower of rain as well as Jovewould I had never seen herO sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travelFulvia is deadsirFulvia is deadFulviadeadwhy sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice when it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new if there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrowthe business she hath broached in the statecannot endure my absenceand the business you have broached here cannot be without you espeally that of Cleopatras which wholly depends on your abodeno more light answers let our officers have notice what we purpose I shall breakthe cause of our expedience to the queenand get her leave to part for not alonethe death of Fulvia with more urgent touchesdo strongly speak to us but the letters tooof many our contriving friends in Romepetition us at home Sextus Pompeiushath given the dare to Ceasar and commandsthe empire of the sea our slippery peoplewhose love is never linked to the deservertill his deserts are past begin to throwpompey the great and all his dignitiesupon his son who high in name and powerhigher than both in blood and life stands upfor the main soldier whose quality going onthe sides ofthe world may danger Much is breedingwhich like the coursers hair hath yet but lifeand not a serpents poison Say our pleasureto such whose place is under us requiresour quick remove from henceI shall do itwhere is heI did not see him sincesee where he is whos with him what he doesI did not send you if you find him sadsay I am danng if in mirth reportthat I am sudden sick quick and returnmadam methinks if you did love him dearlyyou do not hold the method to enforcethe like from himwhat should I do I do notin each thing give him way cross him in nothingthou teachest like a fool the way to lose himtempt him not so too far I wish forbearin time we hate that which we often fearbut here comes AntonyI am sick and sullenI am sorry to give breathing to my purposehelp me away dear Charmian I shall fallit cannot be thus long the sides of naturewill not sustain itnow my dearest queenpray you stand further from mewhats the matterI know by that same eye theres some good newswhat says the married woman you may gowould she had never given you leave to comelet her not say itis I that keep you hereI have no power upon you hers you arethe gods best knowO never was there queenso mightily betrayed yet at the firstI saw the treasons plantedcleopatrawhy should I think you can be mine and truethough you in swearing shake the throned godswho have been false to Fulvia Riotous madnessto be entangled with those mouth-made vowswhich break themselves in swearingmost sweet queennay pray you seek no colour for your goingbut bid farewell and go when you sued stayingthen was the time for words no going theneternity was in our lips and eyesbliss in our brows bent none our parts so poorbut was a race of heaven they are so stillor thou the greatest soldier of the worldart turned the greatest liarhow now ladyI would I had thy inches thou shouldst knowthere were a heart in Egypthear me queenthe strong necessity of time commandsour services awhile but my full heartremains in use with you our Italyshines oer with vile swords Sextus Pompeiusmakes his approaches to the port of Romeequality of two domestic powersbreeds scrupulous faction the hated grown to strengthare newly grown to love the condemned Pompeyrich in his fathers honour creeps apaceinto the hearts of such as have not thrivedupon the present state whose numbers threatenand quietness grown aick of rest would purgeby any desperate change my more particularand that which most with you should safe my goingis Fulvias deaththough age from folly could not give me freedomit does from childishness can Fulvia dieshes dead my queenlook here and at thy sovereign leisure readthe garboils she awaked at the last bestsee when and where she diedO most false lovewhere be the sacred vials thou shouldst fillwith sorrowful water now I see I seein Fulvias death how mine received shall bequarrel no more but be prepared to knowthe purposes I bear which are or ceaseas you shall give the advice by the firethat quickens Nilus slime I go from hencethy soldier servant making peace or waras thou affectestcut my lace Charmian comebut let it be I am quickly ill and wellso Antony lovesmy precious queen forbearand give true evidence to his love which standsan honourable trialso Fulvia told meI prithee turn aside and weep for herthen bid adieu to me and say the tearsbelong to Egypt good now play one sceneof excellent dissembling and let it looklike perfect honouryoull heat my blood no moreyou can do better yet but this is meetlynow by my swordand target Still he mendsbut this is not the best look prithee Charmianhow this Herculean Roman does becomethe carriage of his chafeiull leave you ladycourteous lord one wordsir you and I must part but that s not itsir you and I have loved but there s not itthat you know well something it is I wouldO my oblivion is a very Antonyand I am all forgottenbut that your royaltyholds idleness your subject I should take youfor idleness itselfitis sweating labourto bear such idleness so near the heartas Cleopatra this but sir forgive mesince my becomings kill me when they do noteye well to you your honour calls you hencetherefore be deaf to my unpitied follyand all the gods go with you upon your swordsit laurel victory and smooth successbe strewed before your feetlet us go comeour separation so abides and fliesthat thou residing here goest yet with meand I hence fleeting here remain with theeawayyou may see Lepidus and henceforth knowit is not Ceasars natural vice to hateour great competitor From Alexandriathis is the news he fishes drinks and wastesthe lamps of night in revel is not more manlikethan Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemymore womanly than he hardly gave audience orvouchsafed to think he had partners you shall find therea man who is the abstract of all faultsthat all men followI must not think there areevils enow to darken all his goodnesshis faults in him seem as the spots of heavenmore fiery by nights blackness hereditaryrather than purchased what he cannot changethan what he choosesyou are too indulgent let us grant it is notamiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemyto give a kingdom for a mirth to sitand keep the turn of tippling with a slaveto reel the streets at noon and stand the buffetwith knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes himas his composure must be rare indeedwhom these things cannot blemish yet must Antonyno way excuse his soils when we do bearso great weight in his lightness if he filledhis vacancy with his voluptuousnessfull surfeits and the dryness of his bonescall on him forit but to confound such timethat drums him from his sport and speaks as loudas his own state and ours itis to be chidas we rate boys who being mature in knowledgepawn their experience to their present pleasureand so rebel to judgmentheres more newsthy biddings have been done and every hourmost noble Ceasar shalt thou have reporthow itis abroad Pompey is strong at seaand it appears he is beloved of thosethat only have feared Ceasar to the portsthe discontents repair and mens reportsgive him much wrongedI should have known no lessit hath been taught us from the primal statethat he which is was wished until he wereand the ebbed man neer loved till neer worth lovecomes deared by being lacked this common bodylike to a vagabond flag upon the streamgoes to and back lackeying the varying tideto rot itself with motionCeasar I bring thee wordmenecrates and Menas famous piratesmake the sea serve them which they ear and woundwith keels of every kind many hot inroadsthey make in Italy the borders maritimelack blood to think onit and flush youth revoltno vessel can peep forth but itis as soontaken as seen for Pompeys name strikes morethan could his war resistedantonyleave thy lasvious wassails when thou oncewast beaten from Modena where thou slewesthirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heeldid famine follow whom thou foughtest againstthough daintily brought up with patience morethan savages could suffer thou didst drinkthe stale of horses and the gilded puddlewhich beasts would cough at thy palate then did deignthe roughest berry on the rudest hedgeyea like the stag when snow the pasture sheetsthe barks of trees thou browsedest on the Alpsit is reported thou didst eat strange fleshwhich some did die to look on and all thisit wounds thy honour that I speak it nowwas borne so like a soldier that thy cheekso much as lanked notitis pity of himlet his shames quicklydrive him to Rome itis time we twaindid show ourselves inthe field and to that endassemble me immediate counselpompeythrives in our idlenessto-morrow CeasarI shall be furnished to inform you rightlyboth what by sea and land I can be ableto front this present timetill which encounterit is my business too farewellfarewell my lord what you shall know meantimeof stirs abroad I shall beseech you sirto let me be partakerdoubt not sirI knew it for my bondcharmianmadamha hagive me to drink mandragorawhy madamthat I might sleep out this great gap of timemy Antony is awayyou think of him too muchO itis treasonmadam I trust not sothou eunuch Mardianwhat s your highness pleasurenot now to hear thee sing I take no pleasurein aught a eunuch has itis well for theethat being unseminared thy freer thoughtsmay not fly forth of Egypt hast thou affectionsyes gracious madamindeednot in deed madam for I can do nothingbut what in deed is honest to be doneyet have I fierce affections and thinkwhat Venus did with MarsO Charmianwhere thinkest thou he is now Stands he or sits heor does he walk or is he on his horseO happy horse to bear the weight of Antonydo bravely horse for wotest thou whom thou movestthe demi-atlas of this earth the armand burgonet of men Hes speaking nowor murmuring wheres my serpent of old Nile for so he calls me now I feed myselfwith most delious poison think on methat am with Phoebus amorous pinches blackand wrinkled deep in time broad-fronted Ceasarwhen thou wast here above the ground I wasa morsel for a monarch and great Pompeywould stand and make his eyes grow in my browthere would he anchor his aspect and diewith looking on his lifesovereign of Egypt hailhow much unlike art thou mark Antonyyet coming from him that great medine hathwith his tinct gilded theehow goes it with my brave mark Antonylast thing he did dear queenhe kissed the last of many doubled kissesthis orient pearl his speech sticks in my heartmine ear must pluck it thencegood friend quoth hesay the firm Roman to great Egypt sendsthis treasure of an oyster at whose footto mend the petty present I will pieceher opulent throne with kingdoms all the eastsay thou shall call her mistress so he noddedand soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steedwho neighed so high that what I would have spokewas beastly dumbed by himwhat was he sad or merrylike to the time ofthe year between the extremesof hot and cold he was nor sad nor merryO well-divided disposition note himnote him good Charmian itis the man but note himhe was not sad for he would shire on thosethat make their looks by his he was not merrywhich seemed to tell them his remembrance layin Egypt with his joy but between bothO heavenly mingle beist thou sad or merrythe violence of either thee becomesso does it no man else Mettest thou my postsay madam twenty several messengerswhy do you send so thickwhos born that daywhen I forget to send to Antonyshall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmianwelcome my good Alexas did I Charmianever love Ceasar soO that brave Ceasarbe choked with such another emphasissay the brave Antonythe valiant Ceasarby Isis I will give thee bloody teethif thou with Ceasar paragon againmy man of menby your most gracious pardonI sing but after youmy salad dayswhen I was green in judgment cold in bloodto say as I said then but come awayget me ink and paperhe shall have every day a several greetingor iull unpeople Egyptif the great gods be just they shall assistthe deeds of justest menknow worthy Pompeythat what they do delay they not denywhiles we are suitors to their throne decaysthe thing we sue forwe ignorant of ourselvesbeg often our own harms which the wise powersdeny us for our good so find we profitby losing of our prayersI shall do wellthe people love me and the sea is minemy powers are crescent and my auguring hopesays it will come to the full mark Antonyin Egypt sits at dinner and will makeno wars without doors Ceasar gets money wherehe loses hearts Lepidus flatters bothof both is flattered but he neither lovesnor either cares for himCeasar and Lepidusare in the field a mighty strength they carrywhere have you this itis falsefrom Silvius sirhe dreams I know they are in Rome togetherlooking for Antony but all the charms of lovesalt Cleopatra soften thy waned liplet witchcraft join with beauty lust with bothtie up the libertine in a field of feastskeep his brain fuming Epicurean cookssharpen with cloyless sance his appetitethat sleep and feeding may prorogue his honoureven till a letheed dulnesshow now Varriusthis is most certain that I shall delivermark Antony is every hour in Romeexpected since he went from Egypt itisa space for further travelI could have given less mattera better ear Menas I did not thinkthis amorous surfeiter would have donned his helmfor such a petty war his soldiershipis twice the other twain but let us rearthe higher our opinion that our stirringcan from the lap of Egypts widow pluckthe neer-lust-wearied AntonyI cannot hopeCeasar and Antony shall well greet togetherhis wife thats dead did trespasses to Ceasarhis brother warred upon him although I thinknot moved by AntonyI know not Menashow lesser enmities may give way to greaterwere'tnot that we stand up against them allitwere pregnant they should square between themselvesfor they have entertained cause enoughto draw their swords but how the fear of usmay cement their divisions and bind upthe petty difference we yet not knowbe it as our gods will have'tit only standsour lives upon to use our strongest handscome Menasgood Enobarbus itis a worthy deedand shall become you well to entreat your captainto soft and gentle speechI shall entreat himto answer like himself if Ceasar move himlet Antony look over Ceasars headand speak as loud as Mars by Jupiterwere I the wearer of Antonius beardI would not shave'tto-dayitis not a timefor private stomachingevery timeserves for the matter that is then born initbut small to greater matters must give waynot if the small come firstyour speech is passionbut pray you stir no embers up here comesthe noble Antonyand yonder Ceasarif we compose well here to Parthiahark ye VentidiusI do not knowmec Nas ask Agrippanoble friendsthat which combined us was most great and let nota leaner action rend us whats amissmay it be gently heard when we debateour trivial difference loud we do commitmurder in healing wounds then noble partnersthe rather for I earnestly beseechtouch you the sourest points with sweetest termsnor curstness grow to the matteritis spoken wellwere we before our armies and to fightI should do thuswelcome to Romethank yousitsit sirnay thenI learn you take things ill which are not soor being concern you notI must be laughed atif or for nothing or a little Ishould say myself offended and with youchiefly inthe world more laughed at that I shouldonce name you derogately when to sound your nameit not concerned memy being in Egypt Ceasarwhat was'tto youno more than my residing here at Romemight be to you in Egypt yet if you theredid practise on my state your being in Egyptmight be my questionhow intend you practisedyou may be pleased to catch at mine intentby what did here befall me your wife and brothermade wars upon me and their contestationwas theme for you you were the word of waryou do mistake your business my brother neverdid urge me in his act I did inquire itand have my learning from some true reportsthat drew their swords with you did he not ratherdiscredit my authority with yoursand make the wars alike against my stomachhaving alike your cause of this my lettersbefore did satisfy you if youll patch a quarrelas matter whole you n have to make it withit must not be with thisyou praise yourselfby laying defects of judgment to me butyou patched up your excusesnot so not soI know you could not lack I am certain onitvery necessity of this thought that Iyour partner in the cause gainst which he foughtcould not with graceful eyes attend those warswhich fronted mine own peace as for my wifeI would you had her spirit in such anotherthe third ofthe world is yours which with a snaffleyou may pace easy but not such a wifewould we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the womenso much uncurbable her garboils Ceasarmade out of her impatience which not wantedshrewdness of policy too I grieving grantdid you too much disquiet for that you mustbut say I could not help itI wrote to youwhen rioting in Alexandria youdid pocket up my letters and with tauntsdid gibe my missive out of audiencesirhe fell upon me ere admitted thenthree kings I had newly feasted and did wantof what I was inthe morning but next dayI told him of myself which was as muchas to have asked him pardon let this fellowbe nothing of our strife if we contendout of our question wipe himyou have brokenthe article of your oath which you shall neverhave tongue to charge me withsoft Ceasarnolepidus let him speakthe honours sacred which he talks on nowsupposing that I lacked it but on Ceasarthe article of my oathto lend me arms and aid when I required themthe which you both deniedneglected ratherand then when poisoned hours had bound me upfrom mine own knowledge as nearly as I mayiull play the penitent to you but mine honestyshall not make poor my greatness nor my powerwork without it truth is that Fulviato have me out of Egypt made wars herefor which myself the ignorant motive doso far ask pardon as befits mine honourto stoop in such a caseitis noble spokenif it might please you to enforce no furtherthe griefs between ye to forget them quitewere to remember that the present needspeaks to atone youworthily spoken Mec Nasor if you borrow one anothers love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to dothou art a soldier only speak no morethat truth should be silent I had almost forgotyou wrong this presence therefore speak no morego to then your considerate stoneI do not much dislike the matter butthe manner of his speech for it cannot bewe shall remain in friendship our conditionsso differing in their acts yet if I knewwhat hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edgeofthe world I would pursue itgive me leave Ceasarspeak Agrippathou hast a sister by the mothers sideadmired Octavia great mark Antonyis now a widowersay not so Agrippaif Cleopatra heard you your reproofwere well deserved of rashnessI am not married Ceasar let me hearAgrippa further speakto hold you in perpetual amityto make you brothers and to knit your heartswith an unslipping knot take Antonyoctavia to his wife whose beauty claimsno worse a husband than the best of menwhose virtue and whose general graces speakthat which none else can utter by this marriageall little jealousies which now seem greatand all great fears which now import their dangerswould then be nothing truths would be but taleswhere now half tales be truths her love to bothwould each to other and all loves to bothdraw after her Pardon what I have spokefor itis a studied not a present thoughtby duty ruminatedwill Ceasar speaknot till he hears how Antony is touchedwith what is spoke alreadywhat power is in Agrippaif I would say Agrippa be it so to make this goodthe power of Ceasar andhis power unto Octaviamay I neverto this good purpose that so fairly showsdream of impediment let me have thy handfurther this act of grace and from this hourthe heart of brothers govern in our lovesand sway our great designsthere is my handa sister I bequeath you whom no brotherdid ever love so dearly let her liveto join our kingdoms and our hearts and neverfly off our loves againhappily amenI did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompeyfor he hath laid strange courtesies and greatof late upon me I must thank him onlylest my remembrance suffer ill reportat heel of that defy himtime calls upon sof us must Pompey presently be soughtor else he seeks out uswhere lies heabout the mount Misenumwhats his strengthby landgreat and increasing but by seahe is an absolute masterso is the famewould we had spoke together haste we for ityet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch wethe business we have talked ofwith most gladnessand do invite you to my sisters viewwhither straight iull lead youlet us Lepidusnot lack your companynoble Antonynot sickness should detain mewelcome from Egypt sirhalf the heart of Ceasar worthy Mec Nas my honourable friend Agrippagood Enobarbuswe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested you stayed well by'tinegyptay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinkingeight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there is this truethis was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved notingshes a most triumphant lady if report be square to herwhen she first met mark Antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnusthere she appeared indeed or my reporter devised well for herI will tell youthe barge she sat in like a burnished throneburned on the water the poop was beaten goldpurple the sails and so perfumed thatthe winds were love-sick with them the oars were silverwhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke and madethe water which they beat to follow fasteras amorous of their strokes for her own personit beggared all description she did liein her pavilion cloth-of-gold of tissueoer-picturing that Venus where we seethe fancy outwork nature on each side herstood pretty-dimpled boys like smiling Cupidswith divers-coloured fans whose wind did seemto glow the delicate cheeks which they did cooland what they undid didO rare for Antonyher gentlewomen like the Nereidesso many mermaids tended her inthe eyesand made their bends adornings at the helma seeming mermaid steers the silken tackleswell with the touches of those flower-soft handsthat yarely frame the office From the bargea strange invisible perfume hits the senseof the adjacent wharfs the ty casther people out upon her and Antonyenthroned inthe market-place did sit alonewhistling to the air which but for vacancyhad gone to gaze on Cleopatra tooand made a gap in naturerare Egyptianupon her landing Antony sent to herinvited her to supper she repliedit should be better he became her guestwhich she entreated our courteous Antonywhom neer the word of no woman heard speakbeing barbered ten times oer goes to the feastand for his ordinary pays his heartfor what his eyes eat onlyroyal wenchshe made great Ceasar lay his sword to bedhe ploughed her and she croppedI saw her oncehop forty paces through the public streetand having lost her breath she spoke and pantedthat she did make defect perfectionand breathless power breathe forthnow Antony must leave her utterlynever he will notage cannot wither her nor custom staleher infinite variety other women cloythe appetites they feed but she makes hungrywhere most she satisfies for vilest thingsbecome themselves in her that the holy priestsbless her when she is riggishif beauty wisdom modesty can settlethe heart of Antony Octavia isa blessed lottery to himlet us gogood Enobarbus make yourself my guestwhilst you abide herehumbly sir I thank youthe world and my great office will sometimesdivide me from your bosomall which timebefore the gods my knee shall bow my prayersto them for yougood night sir my Octaviaread not my blemishes in the worlds reportI have not kept my square but that to comeshall all be done by the rule Good night dear ladygood night sirgood nightnow sirrah you do wish yourself in Egyptwould I had never come from thence nor youthitherif you can your reasonI see it inmy motion have it not in my tongue but yethie you to Egypt againsay to mewhose fortunes shall rise higher Ceasars or mineCeasarstherefore O Antony stay not by his sidethy demon thats thy spirit which keeps thee isnoble courageous high unmatchablewhere Ceasars is not but near him thy angelbecomes a fear as being oerpowered thereforemake space enough between youspeak this no moreto none but thee no more but when to theeif thou dost play with him at any gamethou art sure to lose and of that natural luckhe beats thee gainst the odds thy lustre thickenswhen he shines by I say again thy spiritis all afraid to govern thee near himbut he away itis nobleget thee gonesay to Ventidius I would speak with himhe shall to Parthia be it art or haphe hath spoken true the very dice obey himand in our sports my better cunning faintsunder his chance if we draw lots he speedshis cocks do win the battle still of minewhen it is all to nought and his quails everbeat mine inhooped at odds I will to Egyptand though I make this marriage for my peaceinthe east my pleasure liesO come Ventidiusyou must to Parthia your commissions readyfollow me and receive ttrouble yourselves no further pray you hastenyour generals aftersir mark Antonywill een but kiss Octavia and well followtill I shall see you in your soldiers dresswhich will become you both farewellwe shallas I

your angling when your diverdid hang a salt-fish on his hook which hewith fervency drew upthat time O timesI laughed him out of patience and that nightI laughed him into patience and next mornere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bedthen put my tires and mantles on him whilstI wore his sword PhilippanO from Italyram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine earsthat long time have been

father should revengers wanthaving a son and friends since Julius Ceasarwho at PhilippI the good Brutus ghostedthere saw you labouring for him what was tthat moved pale Cassius to conspire and whatmade the all-honoured honest Roman Brutuswith the armed rest courtiers of beauteous freedomto drench the capitol but that they wouldhave one man but a man and that is ithath made me rig my navy at whose burdenthe angered ocean foams with which I meantto scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Romecast on my noble fathertake your timethou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sailswe ll speak with thee at sea at land thou knowesthow much we do oer-count theeat land indeedthou dost oer-count me of my fathers housebut since the cuckoo builds not for himselfremain init as thou maystbe pleased to tell usfor this is from the present how you takethe offers we have sent youtheres the pointwhich do not be entreated to but weighwhat it is worth embracedand what may followto try a larger fortuneyou have made me offerof Sily Sardinia and I mustrid all the sea of pirates then to sendmeasures of wheat to Rome this greed uponto part with unhacked edges and bear backour targets undintedthats our offerthats our offerthats our offerknow thenI came before you here a man preparedto take this offer but mark Antonyput me to some impatience though I losethe praise of it by telling you must knowwhen Ceasar and your brother were at blowsyour mother came to Sily and did findher welcome friendlyI have heard it Pompeyand am well studied for a liberal thankswhich I do owe youlet me have your handI did not think sir to have met you herethe beds inthe east are soft and thanks to youthat called me timelier than my purpose hitherfor I have gained by tsince I saw you lastthere is a change upon youwell I know notwhat counts harsh fortune casts upon my facebut in my bosom shall she never cometo make my heart her vassalwell met hereI hope so Lepidus thus we are agreedI crave our composition may be writtenand sealed between usthat s the next to dowell feast each other ere we part and letsdraw lots who shall beginthat will I Pompeyno Antony take the lotbut first or last your fine Egyptian cookeryshall have the fame I have heard that Julius Ceasargrew fat with feasting thereyou have heard muchI have fair meanings sirand fair words to themthen so much have I heardand I have heard Apollodorus carriedno more of that he did sowhat I pray youa certain queen to Ceasar in a mattressI know thee now how farest thou soldierwelland well am like to do for I perceivefour feasts are towardlet me shake thy handI never hated thee I have seen thee fightwhen I have envied thy behavioursirI never loved you much but I ha praised yewhen you have well deserved ten times as muchas I have said you didenjoy thy plainnessit nothing ill becomes theeaboard my galley I invite you allwill you lead lordsshow

thief by seaand you by landthere I deny my land service but give me your hand Menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissingall mens faces are true whatsoeer their hands arebut there is never a fair woman has a true faceno slander they steal heartswe came hither to fight with youfor my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortuneif he do sure he cannot weep it back againyou have said sir we looked not for mark Antony here pray you is he married to CleopatraCeasars sister is called Octaviatrue sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellusbut she is now the wife of Marcus Antoniuspray ye siritis truethen is Ceasar and he for ever knit togetherif I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy soI think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the partiesI think so too but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversationwho would not have his wife sonot he that himself is not so which is mark Antony he will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Ceasar and as I said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion hereand thus it may be come sir will you aboard I have a health for youI shall take it sir we have used our throats in Egyptcome let s awayhere theyll be man Some oftheir plants are ill-rooted already the least wind inthe world will blow them downlepidus is high-colouredthey have made him drink alms-drinkas they pinch one another by the disposition he cries out no

reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heaveto be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move init are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeksthus do they sir they take the flow ofthe Nileby certain scales inthe pyramid they knowby the height the lowness or the mean if dearthor foison follow the higher Nilus swellsthe more it

make too great an act for learn this Siliusbetter to leave undone than by our deedacquire too high a fame when him we serves awayCeasar and Antony have ever wonmore in their officer than person Sossiusone of my place in Syria his lieutenantfor quick accumulation of renownwhich he achieved by the minute lost his favourwho does inthe wars more than his captain canbecomes his captains captain and ambitionthe soldiers virtue rather makes choice of lossthan gain which darkens himI could do more to do Antonius goodbut twould offend him and in his offenceshould my performance

having made use of him in the wars gainst Pompey presently denied him rivality would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him so the poor third is up till death enlarge his confinethen world thou hast a pair of chaps no moreand throw between them all the food thou hasttheyll grind the one the other wheres Antonyhes walking in the garden thus and spurnsthe rush that lies before him cries fool Lepidus and threats the throat of that his officerthat murdered Pompeyour great navys riggedfor Italy and Ceasar more Domitiusmy lord desires you presently my newsI might have told hereafteritwill be naughtbut let it be bring me to Antonycome sircontemning Rome he has done all this and morein Alexandria heres the manner of tinthe market-place on a tribunal silveredcleopatra and himself in chairs of goldwere publicly enthroned at the feet satCeasarion whom they call my fathers sonand all the unlawful issue that their lustsince then hath made between them unto herhe gave the establishment of Egypt made herof Lower Syria Cyprus Lydiaabsolute queenthis in the public eyeinthe common show-place where they exersehis sons he there proclaimed the kings of kingsgreat Media Parthia and Armeniahe gave to Alexander to Ptolemy he assignedsyria lia and Phrynia Shein the habiliments of the goddess Isisthat day appeared and oft before gave audienceas itis reported solet Rome be thusinformedwho queasy with his insolencealready will their good thoughts call from himthe people know it and have now receivedhis accusationswhom does he accuseCeasar and that having in Silysextus Pompeius spoiled we had not rated himhis part ofthe isle then does he say he lent mesome shipping unrestored lastly he fretsthat Lepidus of the triumvirateshould be deposed and being that we detainall his revenuesir this should be answereditis done already and the messenger goneI have told him Lepidus was grown too cruelthat he his high authority abusedand did deserve his change for what I have conqueredI grant him part but then in his Armeniaand other of his conquered kingdoms Idemand the likehell never yield to thatnor must not then be yielded to in thishail Ceasar and my lord hail most dear Ceasarthat ever I should call thee cast-awayyou have not called me so nor have you causewhy have you stoln upon us thus you come notlike Ceasars sister the wife of Antonyshould have an army for an usher andthe neighs of horse to tell of her approachlong ere she did appear the trees by the wayshould have borne men and expectation faintedlonging for what it had not nay the dustshould have ascended to the roof of heavenraised by your populous troops but you are comea market-maid to Rome and have preventedthe ostentation of our love which left unshownis often left unloved we should have met youby sea and land supplying every stagewith an augmented greetinggood my lordto come thus was I not constrained but did iton my free-will my lord mark Antonyhearing that you prepared for war acquaintedmy grieved ear withal whereon I beggedhis pardon for returnwhich soon he grantedbeing an obstruct btween his lust and himdo not say so my lordI have eyes upon himand his affairs come to me on the windwhere is he nowmy lord in Athensno my most wronged sister Cleopatrahath nodded him to her he hath given his empireup to a whore who now are levyingthe kings ofthe earth for war he hath assembledbocchus the king of Libya Archelausof Cappadoa Philadelphos kingof Paphlagonia the Thraan king Adallasking Malchus of Arabia king of Pontherod of Jewry Mithridates kingof Comagene Polemon and Amintasthe kings of Mede and Lycaoniawith a more larger list of sceptresay me most wretchedthat have my heart parted betwixt two friendsthat do afflict each otherwelcome hitheryour letters did withhold our breaking forthtill we perceived both how you were wrong ledand we in negligent danger cheer your heartbe you not troubled with the time which drivesoer your content these strong necessitiesbut let determined things to destinyhold unbewailed their way welcome to Romenothing more dear to me you are abusedbeyond the mark of thought and the high godsto do you justice make their ministersof us and those that love you Best of comfortand ever welcome to uswelcome ladywelcome dear madameach heart in Rome does love and pity youonly the adulterous Antony most largein his abominations turns you offand gives his potent regiment to a trullthat noises it against usis it so sirmost certain Sister welcome pray yoube ever known to patience my dearest sisterI will be even with thee doubt it notbut why why whythou hast forspoke my being in these warsand sayst it is not fitwell is it is itif not denounced against us why should not webe there in personwell I could replyif we should serve with horse and mares togetherthe horse were merely lost the mares would beara soldier and his horsewhat is it you sayyour presence needs must puzzle Antonytake from his heart take from his brain from s timewhat should not then be spared he is alreadytraduced for levity and itis said in Romethat Photinus a eunuch and your maidsmanage this warsink Rome and their tongues rotthat speak against us a charge we bear inthe warand as the president of my kingdom willappear there for a man speak not against itI will not stay behindnay I have donehere comes the emperoris it not strange Canidiusthat from Tarentum and Brundusiumhe could so quickly cut the Ionian seaand take in Toryne you have heard onit sweetcelerity is never more admiredthan by the negligenta good rebukewhich might have well becomed the best of mento taunt at slackness Canidius wewill fight with him by seaby sea what elsewhy will my lord do sofor that he dares us to tso hath my lord dared him to single fightay and to wage his battle at Pharsaliawhere Ceasar fought with Pompey but these offerswhich serve not for his vantage he shakes offand so should youyour ships are not well mannedyour mariners are muleters reapers peopleingrossed by swift impress in Ceasars fleetare those that often have gainst Pompey foughttheir ships are yare yours heavy no disgraceshall fall you for refusing him at seabeing prepared for landby sea by seamost worthy sir you therein throw awaythe absolute soldiership you have by landdistract your army which doth most consistof war-marked footmen leave unexecutedyour own renowned knowledge quite foregothe way which promises assurance andgive up yourself merely to chance and hazardfrom firm securityiull fight at seaI have sixty sails Ceasar none betterour overplus of shipping will we burnand with the rest full-manned from the head of Actiumbeat the approaching Ceasar but if we failwe then can doit at landthy businessthe news is true my lord he is descriedCeasar has taken Torynecan he be there in person itis impossiblestrange that his power should be Canidiusour nineteen legions thou shalt hold by landand our twelve thousand horse well to our shipaway my Thetishow now worthy soldierO noble emperor do not fight by seatrust not to rotten planks do you misdoubtthis sword and these my wounds let the Egyptiansand the Phaenians go a-ducking wehave used to conquer standing on the earthand fighting foot to footwell well awayby Hercules I think I am inthe rightsoldier thou art but his whole action growsnot in the power onit so our leaders ledand we are womens menyou keep by landthe legions and the horse whole do you notMarcus Octavius Marcus Justeiuspublicola and Cealius are for seabut we keep whole by land this speed of Ceasarscarries beyond beliefwhile he was yet in Romehis power went out in such distractions asbeguiled all spieswhos his lieutenant hear youthey say one Tauruswell I know the manthe emperor calls Canidiuswith news the times with labour and throes fortheach minute sometaurusmy lordstrike not by land keep whole provoke not battletill we have done at sea do not exceedthe prescript of this scroll our fortune liesupon this jumpset we our squadrons on yond side ofthe hillin eye of Ceasars battle from which placewe may the number of the ships beholdand so proceed accordinglynaught naught all naught I can behold no longerthe Antoniad the Egyptian admiralwith all their sixty fly and turn the rudderto seeit mine eyes are blastedgods and goddessesall the whole synod of themwhats thy passionthe greater cantle of the world is lostwith very ignorance we have kissed awaykingdoms and provinceshow appears the fighton our side like the tokened pestilencewhere death is sure yon ribaudred nag of Egyptwhom leprosy oertake inthe midst ofthe fightwhen vantage like a pair of twins appearedboth as the same or rather ours the elderthe breese upon her like a cow in Junehoists sails and fliesthat I beheldmine eyes did sicken at the sight and could notendure a further viewshe once being loofedthe noble ruin of her magic Antonyclapson his sea-wing and like a doting mallardleaving the fight in height flies after herI never saw an action of such shameexperience manhood honour neer beforedid violate so itselfalack alackour fortune on the sea is out of breathand sinks most lamentably Had our generalbeen what he knew himself it had gone wellO he has given example for our flightmost grossly by his ownay are you thereaboutswhy then good night indeedtowards Peloponnesus are they fleditis easy to'tand there I will attendwhat further comesto Ceasar will I rendermy legions and my horse six kings alreadyshow me the way of yieldingiull yet followthe wounded chance of Antony though my reasonsits in the wind against mehark the land bids me tread no more uponitit is ashamed to bear me friends come hitherI am so lated in the world that Ihave lost my way for ever I have a shipladen with gold take that divide it flyand make your peace with Ceasarfly not weI

back love I am full of leadsome wine within there and our viands fortune knowswe scorn her most when most she offers blowslet him appear thats come from Antonyknow you himCeasar itis his schoolmasteran argument that he is plucked when hitherhe sends so poor a pinion of his wingwhich had superfluous kings for messengersnot many moons gone byapproach and speaksuch as I am I come from AntonyI was of late as petty to his endsas is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leafto his grand seabe'tso Declare thine officelord of his fortunes he salutes thee andrequires to live in Egypt which not grantedhe lessens his requests and to thee suesto let him breathe between the heavens and eartha private man in Athens this for himnext Cleopatra does confess thy greatnesssubmits her to thy might and of thee cravesthe rcle of the Ptolemies for her heirsnow hazarded to thy gracefor AntonyI have no ears to his request the queenof audience nor desire shall fail so shefrom Egypt drive her all-disgraced friendor take his life there this if she performshe shall not sue unheard so to them bothfortune pursue theebring him through the bandsfrom Antony win Cleopatra promiseand in our name what she requires add morefrom thine invention offers Women are notin their best fortunes strong but want will perjurethe neer-touched vestal Try thy cunning Thyreusmake thine own edict for thy pains which wewill answer as a lawCeasar I goobserve how Antony becomes his flawand what thou thinkest his very action speaksin every power that movesCeasar I shallwhat shall we do Enobarbusthink and dieis Antony or we in fault for thisantony only that would make his willlord of his reason what though you fledfrom that great face of war whose several rangesfrighted each other why should he followthe itch of his affection should not thenhave nicked his captainship at such a pointwhen half to half the world opposed he beingthe mered question itwas a shame no lessthan was his loss to course your flying flagsand leave his navy gazingprithee peaceis that his answeray my lordthe queen shall then have courtesy so shewill yield us uphe says solet her knowtto the boy Ceasar send this grizzled headand he will fill thy wishes to the brimwith prinpalitiesthat head my lordto him again Tell him he wears the roseof youth upon him from which the world should notesomething particular his coin ships legionsmay be a cowards whose ministers would prevailunder the service of a child as soonas inthe command of Ceasar I dare him thereforeto lay his gay comparisons apartand answer me declined sword against swordourselves alone iull write it follow meyes like enough high-battled Ceasar willunstate his happiness and be staged to the showagainst a sworder I see mens judgments area parcel of their fortunes and things outwarddo draw the inward quality after themto suffer all alike that he should dreamknowing all measures the full Ceasar willanswer his emptiness Ceasar thou hast subduedhis judgment tooa messenger from Ceasarwhat no more ceremony See my womenagainst the blown rose may they stop their nosethat kneeled unto the buds Admit him sirmine honesty and I begin to squarethe loyalty well held to fools does makeour faith mere folly yet he that can endureto follow with allegiance a falln lorddoes conquer him that did his master conquerand earns a place inthe storyCeasars willhear it apartnone but friends say boldlyso haply are they friends to Antonyhe needs as many sir as Ceasar hasor needs not us if Ceasar please our masterwill leap to be his friend for us you knowwhose he is we are and that is Ceasarssothus then thou most renowned Ceasar entreatsnot to consider in what case thou standestfurther than he is Ceasargo on right royalhe knows that you embrace not Antonyas you did love but as you feared himOthe scars upon your honour therefore hedoes pity as constrained blemishesnot as deservedhe is a god and knowswhat is most right mine honour was not yieldedbut conquered merelyto be sure of thatI will ask Antony sir sir thourt so leakythat we must leave thee to thy sinking forthy dearest quit theeshall I say to Ceasarwhat you require of him for he partly begsto be desired to give it much would please himthat of his fortunes you should make a staffto lean upon but it would warm his spiritsto hear from me you had left Antonyand put yourself under his shroudthe universal landlordwhats your namemy name is Thyreusmost kind messengersay to great Ceasar this in deputationI kiss his conquring hand tell him I am promptto lay my crown at s feet and there to kneeltell him from his all-obeying breath I hearthe doom of Egyptitis your noblest coursewisdom and fortune combating togetherif that the former dare but what it canno chance may shake it give me grace to laymy duty on your handyour Ceasars father oftwhen he hath mused of taking kingdoms inbestowed his lips on that unworthy placeas it rained kissesfavours by Jove that thunderswhat art thou fellowone that but performsthe bidding of the fullest man and worthiestto have command obeyedyou will be whippedapproach there ah you kite now gods and devilsauthority melts from me of late when I cried Ho like boys unto a muss kings would start forthand cry your will have you no ears I amantony yettake hence this Jack and whip himitis better playing with a lions whelpthan with an old one dyingmoon and starswhip him wereit twenty of the greatest tributariesthat do acknowledge Ceasar should I find themso saucy with the hand of she here whats her namesince she was Cleopatra whip him fellowstill like a boy you see him cringe his faceand whine aloud for mercy take him hencemark Antonytug him away being whippedbring him again this Jack of Ceasars shallbear us an errand to himyou were half blasted ere I knew you hahave I my pillow left unpressed in Romeforborne the getting of a lawful raceand by a gem of women to be abusedby one that looks on feedersgood my lordyou have been a boggler everbut when we in our viousness grow hardO misery onit the wise gods seel our eyesin our own filth drop our clear judgments make usadore our errors laugh at s while we strutto our confusionO isit come to thisI found you as a morsel cold upondead Ceasars trencher nay you were a fragmentof Cornelius Pompeys besides what hotter hoursunregistered in vulgar fame you haveluxuriously picked out for I am surethough you can guess what temperance should beyou know not what it iswherefore is thisto let a fellow that will take rewardsand say God quit you be familiar withmy playfellow your hand this kingly sealand plighter of high hearts O that I wereupon the hill of Basan to outroarthe horned herd for I have savage causeand to proclaim it villy were likea haltered neck which does the hangman thankfor being yare about himis he whippedsoundly my lordcried he and begged a pardonhe did ask favourif that thy father live let him repentthou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorryto follow Ceasar in his triumph sincethou hast been whipped for following him henceforththe white hand of a lady fever theeshake thou to look onit get thee back to Ceasartell him thy entertainment look thou sayhe makes me angry with him for he seemsproud and disdainful harping on what I amnot what he knew I was he makes me angryand at this time most easy itis to doitwhen my good stars that were my former guideshave empty left their orbs and shot their firesinto the abysm of hell if he mislikemy speech and what is done tell him he hashipparchus my enfranched bondman whomhe may at pleasure whip or hang or tortureas he shall like to quit me urge it thouhence with thy stripes be gonehave you done yetalack our terrene moonis now eclipsed and it portends alonethe fall of AntonyI must stay his timeto flatter Ceasar would you mingle eyeswith one that ties his pointsnot know me yetcold-hearted toward meah dear if I be sofrom my cold heart let heaven engender hailand poison it in the source and the first stonedrop in my neck as it determines sodissolve my life the next Ceasarion smitetill by degrees the memory of my wombtogether with my brave Egyptians allby the discandying of this pelleted stormlie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nilehave buried them for preyI am satisfiedCeasar sits down in Alexandria whereI will oppose his fate our force by landhath nobly held our severed navy toohave knit again and fleet threatning most sea-likewhere hast thou been my heart dost thou hear ladyif from the field I shall return once moreto kiss these lips I will appear in bloodI and my sword will earn our chronicletheres hope init yetthats my brave lordI will betreble-sinewed hearted breathedand fight maliously

for I will contendeven with his pestilent scythenow hell outstare the lightning to be furiousis to be frighted out of fear and in that moodthe dove will peck the estridge and I see stilla diminution in our captains brainrestores his heart when valour preys on reasonit eats the sword it fights with I will seeksome way to leave himhe calls me boy and chides as he had powerto beat me out of Egypt my messengerhe hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combatCeasar to Antony let the old ruffian knowI have many other ways to die meantimelaugh at his challengeCeasar must thinkwhen one so great begins to rage hes huntedeven to falling give him no breath but nowmake boot of his distraction never angermade good guard for itselflet our best headsknow that to-morrow the last of many battleswe mean to fight Within our files there areof those that served mark Antony but lateenough to fetch him in See it doneand feast the army we have store to doitand they have

great a thing should makea greater crack the round worldshould have shook lions into civil streetsand tizens to their dens the death of Antonyis not a single doom in the name laya moiety of the worldhe is dead Ceasarnot by a public minister of justicenor by a hired knife but that self handwhich writ his honour in the acts it didhath with the courage which the heart did lend itsplitted the heart this is his swordI robbed his wound of it behold it stainedwith his most noble bloodlook you sad friendsthe gods rebuke me but it is tidingsto wash the eyes of kingsand strange it isthat nature must compel us to lamentour most persisted deedshis taints and honourswaged equal with hima rarer spirit neverdid steer humanity but you gods will give ussome faults to make us men Ceasar is touchedwhen such a spaous mirrors set before himhe needs must see himselfO AntonyI have followed thee to this but we do lancediseases in our bodies I must perforcehave shown to thee such a declining dayor look on thine we could not stall togetherin the whole world but yet let me lamentwith tears as sovereign as the blood of heartsthat thou my brother my competitorin top of all design my mate in empirefriend and companion in the front of warthe arm of mine own body and the heartwhere mine his thoughts did kindle that our starsunreconliable should divideour equalness to this Hear me good friendsbut I will tell you at some meeter seasonthe business of this man looks out of himwell hear him what he says whence are youa poor Egyptian yet the queen my

makea better life itis paltry to be Ceasarnot being fortune hes but fortunes knavea minister of her will and it is greatto do that thing that ends all other deedswhich shackles acdents and bolts up changewhich sleeps and never palates more the dugthe beggars nurse and CeasarsCeasar sends greeting to the queen of Egyptand bids thee study on what fair demandsthou meanest to have him grant theewhats thy namemy name is Proculeiusantonydid tell me of you bade me trust you butI do not greatly care to be deceivedthat have no use for trusting if your masterwould have a queen his beggar you must tell himthat majesty to keep decorum mustno less beg than a kingdom if he pleaseto give me conquered Egypt for my sonhe gives me so much of mine own as Iwill kneel to him with

to himsay I would diemost noble empress you have heard of meI cannot tellassuredly you know meno matter sir what I have heard or knownyou laugh when boys or women tell their dreamsis it not your trickI understand not madamI dreamed there was an emperor AntonyO such another sleep that I might seebut such another manif it might please yehis face was as the heavens and therein stucka sun and moon which kept their course and lightedthe little O the earthmost sovereign creaturehis legs besfrid the ocean his reared armcrested the world his voice was propertiedas all the tuned spheres and that to friendsbut when he meant to quail and shake the orbhe was as rattling thunder for his bountythere was no winter init an autumn itwasthat grew the more by reaping his delightswere dolphin-like they showed his back abovethe element they lived in in his liverywalked crowns and crownets realms and islands wereas plates dropped from his pocketcleopatrathink you there was or might be such a manas this I dreamed ofgentle madam noyou lie up to the hearing of the godsbut if there be or ever were one suchits past the size of dreaming nature wants stuffto vie strange forms with fancy yet to imaginean Antony were natures piece gainst fancycondemning shadows quitehear me good madamyour loss is as yourself great and you bear itas answering to the weight would I might neveroertake pursued success but I do feelby the rebound of yours a grief that smitesmy very heart at rootI thank you sirknow you what Ceasar means to do with meI am loath to tell you what I would you knewnay pray you sirthough he be honourablehell lead me then in triumphmadam he will I know twhich is the queen of Egyptit is the emperor madamarise you shall not kneelI pray you rise rise Egyptsir the godswill have it thus my master and my lordI must obeytake to you no hard thoughtsthe record of what injuries you did usthough written in our flesh we shall rememberas things but done by chancesole sir ofthe worldI cannot project mine own cause so wellto make it clear but do confess I havebeen laden with like frailties which beforehave often shamed our sexcleopatra knowwe will extenuate rather than enforceif you apply yourself to our intentswhich towards you are most gentle you shall finda benefit in this change but if you seekto lay on me a cruelty by takingantonys course you shall bereave yourselfof my good purposes and put your childrento that destruction which iull guard them fromif thereon you rely iull take my leaveand may through all the world itis yours and weyour scutcheons and your signs of conquest shallhang in what place you please here my good lordyou shall advise me in all for Cleopatrathis is the brief of money plate and jewelsI am possessed of itis exactly valuednot petty things admitted wheres Seleucushere madamthis is my treasurer let him speak my lordupon his peril that I have reservedto myself nothing speak the truth SeleucusmadamI had rather seal my lips than to my perilspeak that which is notwhat have I kept backenough to purchase what you have made knownnay blush not Cleopatra I approveyour wisdom in the deedsee Ceasar O beholdhow pomp is followed mine will now be yoursand should we shift estates yours would be minethe ingratitude of this Seleucus doeseven make me wild O slave of no more trustthan love thats hired what goest thou back thou shaltgo back I warrant thee but iull catch thine eyesthough they had wings slave soulless villain dogO rarely basegood queen let usentreat youO Ceasar what a wounding shame is thisthat thou vouchsafing here to visit medoing the honour of thy lordlinessto one so meek that mine own servant shouldparcel the sum of my disgraces byaddition of his envy Say good Ceasarthat I some lady trifles have reservedimmoment toys things of such dignityas we greet modern friends withal and saysome nobler token I have kept apartfor Livia and Octavia to inducetheir mediation must I be unfoldedwith one that I have bred the gods it smites mebeneath the fall I haveprithee go henceor I shall show the nders of my spiritsthrough the ashes of my chance Wert thou a manthou wouldst have mercy on meforbear Seleucusbe it known that we the greatest are misthoughtfor things that others do and when we fallwe answer others merits in our nameare therefore to be pitiedcleopatranot what you have reserved nor what acknowledgedput we inthe roll of conquest still be'tyoursbestow it at your pleasure and believeCeasars no merchant to make prize with youof things that merchants sold therefore be cheeredmake not your thoughts your prisons no dear queenfor we intend so to dispose you asyourself shall give us counsel feed and sleepour care and pity is so much upon youthat we remain your friend and so adieumy master and my lordnot so Adieuhe words me girls he words me that I

daysyou with your children will be send beforemake your best use of this I have performedyour pleasure and my promisedolabellaI shall remain your debtorI your servantadieu good queen I must attend on Ceasarfarewell and thanksnow Iras what thinkest thouthou an Egyptian puppet shall be shownin Rome as well as I mechanic slaveswith greasy aprons rules and hammers shalluplift us to the view in their thick breathsrank of gross diet shall we be encloudedand forced to drink their vapourthe gods forbidnay itis most certain Iras Saucy lictorswill catch at us like strumpets and scald rimersballad us out o tune the quick comediansextemporally will stage us and presentour Alexandrian revels Antonyshall be brought drunken forth and I shall seesome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnessinthe posture of a whoreO the good godsnay thats certainiull never see it for I am sure my nailsare stronger than mine eyeswhy thats the wayto fool their preparation and to conquertheir most absurd intentsnow Charmianshow me my women like a queen go fetchmy best attires I am again for Cydnusto meet mark Antony Sirrah Iras gonow noble Charmian well dispatch indeedand when thou hast done this chare iull give thee leaveto play till doomsday bring our crown and allwherefores this noisehere is a rural fellowthat will not be denied your highness presencehe brings you figslet him come inwhat poor an instrumentmay do a noble deed he brings me libertymy resolutions placed and I have nothingof woman in me now from head to footI am marble-constant now the fleeting moonno planet is of minethis is the manavoid and leave himhast thou the pretty worm of Nilus therethat kills and pains nottruly I have him but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or never recoverrememberest thou any that have died onitvery many men and women too I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes a very good report ofthe worm but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do but this is most fallible the worms an odd wormget thee hence farewellI wish you all joy of the wormfarewellyou must think this look you that the worm will do his kinday ay farewelllook you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the wormtake thou no care it shall be heededvery good give it nothing I pray you for it is not worth the feedingwill it eat meyou must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not but truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar fivewell get thee gone farewellyes forsooth I wish you joy of the wormgive me my robe put on my crown I haveimmortal longings in me now no morethe juice of Egypts grape shall moist this lipYare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hearantony call I see him rouse himselfto praise my noble act I hear him mockthe luck of Ceasar which the gods give mento excuse their after wrath husband I comenow to that name my courage prove my titleI am fire and air my other elementsI give to baser life so have you donecome then and take the last warmth of my lipsfarewell kind Charmian Iras long farewellhave I the aspic in my lips dost fallif thou and nature can so gently partthe stroke of death is as a lovers pinchwhich hurts and is desired dost thou lie stillif thus thou vanishest thou tellest the worldit is not worth leave-takingdissolve thick cloud and rain that I may saythe gods themselves do weepthis proves me baseif she first meet the curled Antonyhell make demand of her and spend that kisswhich is my heaven to have come thou mortal wretchwith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicateof life at once untie poor venomous foolbe angry and dispatch O couldst thou speakthat I might hear thee call great Ceasar assunpoliedO eastern starpeace peacedost thou not see my baby at my breastthat sucks the nurse asleepO break O breakas sweet as balm as soft as air as gentleO Antony nay I will take thee toowhat should I stayin this vile world so fare thee wellnow boast thee death in thy possession liesa lass unparalleled Downy windows closeand golden Phoebus never be beheldof eyes again so royal your crowns awryiull mend it and then playwhere is the queenspeak softly wake her notCeasar hath senttoo slow a messengerO come apace dispatch I partly feel theeapproach ho Alls not well Ceasars beguiledtheres Dolabella sent from Ceasar call himwhat work is here Charmian is this well doneit is well done and fitting for a princessdescended of so many royal kingsah soldierhow goes it hereall deadCeasar thy thoughtstouch their effects in this thyself art comingto see performed the dreaded act which thouso soughtest to hinderO sir you are too sure an augurerthat you did fear is donebravest at the lastshe levelled at our purposes and being royaltook her own way the manner of their deathsI do not see them bleedwho was last with thema simple countryman that brought her figsthis was his basketpoisoned thenO Ceasarthis Charmian lived but now she stood and spakeI found her trimming up the diademon her dead mistress tremblingly she stoodand on the sudden droppedO noble weaknessif they had swallowed poisonitwould appearby external swelling but she looks like sleepas she would catch another Antonyin her strong toil of gracehere on her breastthere is a vent of blood and something blownthe like is on her armthis is an aspics trail and these fig-leaveshave slime upon them such as the aspic leavesupon the caves of Nilemost probablethat so she died for her physian tells meshe hath pursued conclusions infiniteof easy ways to die take up her bedand bear her women from the monumentshe shall be buried by her Antonyno grave upon the earth shall clip in ita pair so famous high events as thesestrike those that make them and their story isno less in pity than his glory whichbrought them to be lamented our army shallin solemn show attend this funeraland then to Rome come Dolabella seehigh order in this great solemnitycoriolanusbefore we proceed any further hear me speakspeak speakyou are all resolved rather to die than to famishresolved resolvedfirst you know Caius Marus is chief enemy to the peoplewe knowt we knowtlet us kill him and well have corn at our own price isit a verdictno more talking onit let it be doneaway awayone word good tizenswe are accounted poor tizens the patrians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revengewould you proceed espeally against Caius Marusagainst him first hes a very dog to the commonaltyconsider you what services he has done for his countryvery well and could be content to give him good report forit but that he pays himself with being proudnay but speak not maliouslyI say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft-consenced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtuewhat he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetousif I must not I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetitionwhat shouts are these the other side ofthe ty is risen why stay we prating here to the capitolcome comesoft who comes hereworthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always loved the peoplehes one honest enough would all the rest were sowhat works my countrymen in hand where go youwith bats and clubs the matter speak I pray youour business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now well show em in deeds they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms toowhy masters my good friends mine honest neighbourswill you undo yourselveswe cannot sir we are undone alreadyI tell you friends most charitable carehave the patrians of you for your wantsyour suffering in this dearth you may as wellstrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themagainst the Roman state whose course will onthe way it takes cracking ten thousand curbsof more strong link asunder than can everappear in your impediment for the dearththe gods not the patrians make it andyour knees to them not arms must help Alackyou are transported by calamitythither where more attends you and you slanderthe helms ofthe state who care for you like fatherswhen you curse them as enemiescare for us true indeed they neer cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more pierng statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and theres all the love they bear useither you mustconfess yourselves wondrous maliousor be accused of folly I shall tell youa pretty tale it may be you have heard itbut since it serves my purpose I will ventureto scalet a little morewell iull hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but ant please you deliverthere was a time when all the bodys membersrebelled against the belly thus accused itthat only like a gulf it did remaininthe midst ofthe body idle and unactivestill cupboarding the viand never bearinglike labour with the rest where the other instrumentsdid see and hear devise instruct walk feeland mutually partipate did ministerunto the appetite and affection commonof the whole body the belly answeredwell sir what answer made the bellysir I shall tell you With a kind of smilewhich neer came from the lungs but even thusfor look you I may make the belly smileas well as speak it tauntingly repliedto the discontented members the mutinous partsthat envied his receipt even so most fitlyas you malign our senators for thatthey are not such as youyour bellys answer whatthe kingly crowned head the vigilant eyethe counsellor heart the arm our soldierour steed the leg the tongue our trumpeterwith other muniments and petty helpsin this our fabric if that theywhat thenfore me this fellow speaks what then what thenshould by the cormorant belly be restrainedwho is the sink ofthe bodywell what thenthe former agents if they did complainwhat could the belly answerI will tell youif youll bestow a small of what you have littlepatience a while youll hear the bellys answeryoure long about itnote me this good friendyour most grave belly was deliberatenot rash like his accusers and thus answeredtrue is it my incorporate friends quoth hethat I receive the general food at firstwhich you do live upon and fit it isbecause I am the store-house and the shopof the whole body but if you do rememberI send it through the rivers of your bloodeven to the court the heart to the seat ofthe brainand through the cranks and offices of manthe strongest nerves and small inferior veinsfrom me receive that natural competencywhereby they live and though that all at onceyou my good friends this says the belly mark meay sir well wellthough all at once cannotsee what I do deliver out to eachyet I can make my audit up that allfrom me do back receive the flour of alland leave me but the bran what say you toitit was an answer how apply you thisthe senators of Rome are this good bellyand you the mutinous members for examinetheir counsels and their cares digest things rightlytouching the weal ofthe common you shall findno public benefit which you receivebut it proceeds or comes from them to youand no way from yourselves what do you thinkyou the great toe of this assemblyI the great toe why the great toefor that being one ofthe lowest basest poorestof this most wise rebellion thou goest foremostthou rascal that art worst in blood to runleadest first to win some vantagebut make you ready your stiff bats and clubsRome and her rats are at the point of battlethe one side must have balehail noble Marusthanks whats the matter you dissentious roguesthat rubbing the poor itch of your opinionmake yourselves scabswe have ever your good wordhe that will give good words to thee will flatterbeneath abhorring what would you have you cursthat like nor peace nor war the one affrights youthe other makes you proud he that trusts to youwhere he should find you lions finds you hareswhere foxes geese you are no surer nothan is the coal of fire upon the iceor hailstone in the sun your virtue isto make him worthy whose offence subdues himand curse that justice did it who deserves greatnessdeserves your hate and your affections area sick mans appetite who desires most thatwhich would increase his evil he that dependsupon your favours swims with fins of leadand hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust yewith every minute you do change a mindand call him noble that was now your hatehim vile that was your garland whats the matterthat in these several places of the tyyou cry against the noble senate whounder the gods keep you in awe which elsewould feed on one another whats their seekingfor corn at their own rates whereof they saythe ty is well storedhang em they saytheyll sit by the fire and presume to knowwhats done inthe capitol whos like to risewho thrives and who declines side factions and give outconjectural marriages making parties strongand feebling such as stand not in their likingbelow their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enoughwould the nobility lay aside their ruthand let me use my sword id make a quarrywith thousands of these quartered slaves as highas I could pick my lancenay these are almost thoroughly persuadedfor though abundantly they lack discretionyet are they passing cowardly but I beseech youwhat says the other troopthey are dissolved hang emthey said they were an-hungry sighed forth proverbsthat hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eatthat meat was made for mouths that the gods sent notcorn for the rich men only With these shredsthey vented their complainings which being answeredand a petition granted them a strange oneto break the heart of generosityand make bold power look pale they threw their capsas they would hang them on the horns ofthe moonshouting their emulationwhat is granted themfive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdomsof their own choice ones Junius Brutussinius Velutus and I know not Sdeaththe rabble should have first unroofed the tyere so prevailed with me it will in timewin upon power and throw forth greater themesfor insurrections arguingthis is strangego get you home you fragmentswheres Caius Marushere whats the matterthe news is sir the Volsces are in armsI am glad onit then we shall ha means to ventour musty superfluity See our best eldersmarus itis true that you have lately told usthe Volsces are in armsthey have a leadertullus Aufidius that will put you toitI sin in envying his nobilityand were I anything but what I amI would wish me only heyou have fought togetherwere half to half the world by the ears and heupon my party id revolt to makeonly my wars with him he is a lionthat I am proud to huntthen worthy Marusattend upon Cominius to these warsit is your former promisesir it isand I am constant Titus Lartius thoushalt see me once more strike at Tullus facewhat art thou stiff standest outno Caius Marusiull lean upon one crutch and fight with totherere stay behind this businessO true-bredyour company to the capitol where I knowour greatest friends attend uslead you onfollow Cominius we must follow youright worthy you prioritynoble Marushence to your homes be gonenay let them followthe Volsces have much corn take these rats thitherto gnaw their garners Worshipful mutinersyour valour puts well forth pray followwas ever man so proud as is this Marushe has no equalwhen we were chosen tribunes for the peoplemarked you his lip and eyesnay but his tauntsbeing moved he will not spare to gird the godsbemock the modest moonthe present wars devour him he is growntoo proud to be so valiantsuch a naturetickled with good success disdains the shadowwhich he treads on at noon but I do wonderhis insolence can brook to be commandedunder Cominiusfame at the which he aimsin whom already he is well graced cannotbetter be held nor more attained than bya place below the first for what miscarriesshall be the generals fault though he performto the utmost of a man and giddy censurewill then cry out of Marus O if hehad borne the business besides if things go wellopinion that so sticks on Marus shallof his demerits rob Cominiuscomehalf all Cominius honours are to Marusthough Marus earned them not and all his faultsto Marus shall be honours though indeedin aught he merit notlets hence and hearhow the dispatch is made and in what fashionmore than his singularity he goesupon this present actionlets alongso your opinion is Aufidiusthat they of Rome are entered in our counselsand know how we proceedis it not yourswhat ever have been thought on in this statethat could be brought to bodily act ere Romehad rcumvention itis not four days gonesince I heard thence these are the words I thinkI have the letter here yes here it isthey have pressed a power but it is not knownwhether for east or west the dearth is greatthe people mutinous and it is rumouredcominius Marus your old enemywho is of Rome worse hated than of youand Titus Lartius a most valiant Romanthese three lead on this preparationwhither itis bent most likely itis for youconsider of itour armys in the fieldwe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyto answer usnor did you think it follyto keep your great pretences veiled till whenthey needs must show themselves which in the hatchingit seemed appeared to Rome by the discoverywe shall be shortened in our aim which wasto take in many towns ere almost Romeshould know we were afootnoble Aufidiustake your commission chide you to your bandslet us alone to guard CoriolIif they set down befores for the removebring up your army but I think youll findtheyve not prepared for usO doubt not thatI speak from certainties nay moresome parcels of their power are forth alreadyand only hitherward I leave your honoursif we and Caius Marus chance to meetitis sworn between us we shall ever striketill one can do no morethe gods assist youand keep your honours safefarewellfarewellfarewellI pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picture-like to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a manbut had he died in the business madam how thenthen his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marus I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of actionmadam the Lady Valeria is come to visit youbeseech you give me leave to retire myselfindeed you

heelswith them he enters who upon the suddenclapped-to their gates he is himself aloneto answer all the tyO noble fellowwho sensibly outdares his senseless swordand when it bows stands up thou art left Marusa carbuncle entire as big as thou artwere not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldiereven to Catos wish not fierce and terribleonly in strokes but with thy grim looks andthe thunder-like percussion of thy soundsthou madest thine enemies shake as if the worldwere feverous and did tremblelook sirO itis Maruslets fetch him off or make remain alikethis will I carry to Romeand I thisa murrain onit I took this for silversee here these movers that do prize their hoursat a cracked drachme Cushions leaden spoonsirons of a doit doublets that hangmen wouldbury with those that wore them these base slavesere yet the fight be done pack up Down with themand hark what noise the general makes to himthere is the man of my souls hate Aufidiuspierng our Romans then valiant Titus takeconvenient numbers to make good the tywhilst I with those that have the spirit will hasteto help Cominiusworthy sir thou bleedestthy exerse hath been too violentfor a second course of fightsir praise me notmy work hath yet not warmed me fare you wellthe blood I drop is rather physicalthan dangerous to me to Aufidius thusI will appear and fightnow the fair goddess fortunefall deep in love with thee and her great charmsmisguide thy opposers swords Bold gentlemanprosperity be thy pagethy friend no lessthan those she places highest so farewellthou worthiest Marusgo sound thy trumpet in the market-placecall thither all the officers of the townwhere they shall know our mind awaybreathe you my friends well fought we are come offlike Romans neither foolish in our standsnor cowardly in retire believe me sirswe shall be charged again whiles we have struckby interims and conveying gusts we have heardthe charges of our friends ye Roman godslead their successes as we wish our ownthat both our powers with smiling fronts encounteringmay give you thankful sacrificethy newsthe tizens of CoriolI have issuedand given to Lartius and to Marus battleI saw our party to their trenches drivenand then I came awaythough thou speakest truthmethinks thou speakest not well how long isit sinceabove an hour my lorditis not a mile briefly we heard their drumshow couldst thou in a mile confound an hourand bring thy news so latespies of the Volscesheld me in chase that I was forced to wheelthree or four miles about else had I sirhalf an hour since brought my reportwhos yonderthat does appear as he were flayed O godshe has the stamp of Marus and I havebefore-time seen him thuscome I too latethe shepherd knows not thunder from a tabormore than I know the sound of Marus tonguefrom every meaner mancome I too lateay if you come not in the blood of othersbut mantled in your ownO let me clip yein arms as sound as when I wooed in heartas merry as when our nuptial day was doneand tapers burned to bedwardflower of warriorshow isit with Titus Lartiusas with a man busied about decreescondemning some to death and some to exileransoming him or pitying threatning the otherholding CoriolI in the name of Romeeven like a fawning greyhound in the leashto let him slip at willwhere is that slavewhich told me they had beat you to your trencheswhere is he call him hitherlet him alonehe did inform the truth but for our gentlementhe common file a plague tribunes for themthe mouse neer shunned the cat as they did budgefrom rascals worse than theybut how prevailed youwill the time serve to tell I do not thinkwhere is the enemy are you lords ofthe fieldif not why cease you till you are somarus we have at disadvantage foughtand did retire to win our purposehow lies their battle know you on which sidethey have placed their men of trustas I guess Marustheir bands inthe vaward are the Antiatesof their best trust oer them Aufidiustheir very heart of hopeI do beseech youby all the battles wherein we have foughtby the blood we have shed together by the vowswe have made to endure friends that you directlyset me against Aufidius and his Antiatesand that you not delay the present butfilling the air with swords advanced and dartswe prove this very hourthough I could wishyou were conducted to a gentle bathand balms applied to you yet dare I neverdeny your asking take your choice of thosethat best can aid your actionthose are theythat most are willing if any such be hereas it were sin to doubt that love this paintingwherein you see me smeared if any fearlesser his person than an ill reportif any think brave death outweighs bad lifeand that his countrys dearer than himselflet him alone or so many so mindedwave thus to express his dispositionand follow MarusO me alone make you a sword of meif these shows be not outward which of youbut is four Volsces none of you but isable to bear against the great Aufidiusa shield as hard as his a certain numberthough thanks to all must I select from all the restshall bear the business in some other fightas cause will be obeyed please you to marchand four shall quickly draw out my commandwhich men are best inclinedmarch on my fellowsmake good this ostentation and you shalldivide in all with usso let the ports be guarded keep your dutiesas I have set them down if I do send dispatchthose centuries to our aid the rest will servefor a short holding if we lose the fieldwe cannot keep the townfear not our care sirhence and shut your gates upon usour guider come to the Roman camp conduct usiull fight with none but thee for I do hate theeworse than a promise-breakerwe hate alikenot Afric owns a serpent I abhormore than thy fame and envy fix thy footlet the first budger die the others slaveand the gods doom him afterif I fly Marushalloo me like a harewithin these three hours Tullusalone I fought in your CoriolI wallsand made what work I pleased itis not my bloodwherein thou seest me masked for thy revengewrench up thy power to the highestwert thou the Hectorthat was the whip of your bragged progenythou shouldst not scape me hereoffious and not valiant you have shamed mein your condemned secondsif I should tell thee oer this thy days workthoult not believe thy deeds but iull report itwhere senators shall mingle tears with smileswhere great patrians shall attend and shruginthe end admire where ladies shall be frightedand gladly quaked hear more where the dull Tribunesthat with the fusty plebeians hate thine honoursshall say against their heartswe thank the gods our Rome hath such a soldier yet camest thou to a morsel of this feasthaving fully dined beforeO generalhere is the steed we the caparisonhadst thou beheldpray now no more my motherwho has a charter to extol her bloodwhen she does praise me grieves me I have doneas you have done thats what I can inducedas you have been thats for my countryhe that has but effected his good willhath overtaen mine actyou shall not bethe grave of your deserving Rome must knowthe value of her own itwere a concealmentworse than a theft no less than a traducementto hide your doings and to silence thatwhich to the spire and top of praises vouchedwould seem but modest therefore I beseech youin sign of what you are not to rewardwhat you have done before our army hear meI have some wounds upon me and they smartto hear themselves rememberedshould they notwell might they fester gainst ingratitudeand tent themselves with death of all the horseswhereof we have taen good and good store of allthe treasure in this field achieved and tywe render you the tenth to be taen forthbefore the common distributionat your only choiceI thank you generalbut cannot make my heart consent to takea bribe to pay my sword I do refuse itand stand upon my common part with thosethat have beheld the doingmay these same instruments which you profanenever sound more when drums and trumpets shallinthe field prove flatterers let courts and ties bemade all of false-faced soothingwhen steel grows soft as is the parasites silklet him be made a coverture for the warsno more I say for that I have not washedmy nose that bled or foiled some debile wretchwhich without note heres many else have doneyou shout me forthin acclamations hyperbolicalas if I loved my little should be dietedin praises sauced with liestoo modest are youmore cruel to your good report than gratefulto us that give you truly by your patienceif gainst yourself you be incensed well put youlike one that means his proper harm in manaclesthen reason safely with you therefore be it knownas to us to all the world that Caius Maruswears this wars garland in token of the whichmy noble steed known to the camp I give himwith all his trim belonging and from this timefor what he did before CoriolI call himwith all the applause and clamour of the hostthe addition nobly evercaius Marus CoriolanusI will go washand when my face is fair you shall perceivewhether I blush or no howbeit I thank youI mean to stride your steed and at all timesto undercrest your good additionto the fairness of my powerso to our tentwhere ere we do repose us we will writeto Rome of our success you Titus Lartiusmust to CoriolI back send us to Romethe best with whom we may articulatefor their own good and oursI shall my lordthe gods begin to mock me I that nowrefused most princely gifts am bound to begof my lord generaltake it itis yours what isitI sometime lay here in CoriolIat a poor mans house he used me kindlyhe cried to me I saw him prisonerbut then Aufidius was within my viewand wrath oerwhelmed my pity I request youto give my poor host freedomO well beggedwere he the butcher of my son he shouldbe free as is the wind Deliver him Titusmarus his nameby Jupiter forgotI am weary yea my memory is tiredhave we no wine herego we to our tentthe blood upon your visage dries itis timeit should be looked to comethe town is taenitwill be delivered back on good conditionconditionI would I were a Roman for I cannotbeing a Volsce be that I am conditionwhat good condition can a treaty findinthe part that is at mercy five times MarusI have fought with thee so often hast thou beat meand wouldst do so I think should we encounteras often as we eat by the elementsif eer again I meet him beard to beardhe is mine or I am his mine emulationhath not that honour init it had for whereI thought to crush him in an equal forcetrue sword to sword iull potch at him some wayor wrath or craft may get himhes the devilbolder though not so subtle my valours poisonedwith only suffering stain by him for himshall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuarybeing naked sick nor fane nor capitolthe prayers of priests nor times of sacrificeembarquements all of fury shall lift uptheir rotten privilege and custom gainstmy hate to Marus where I find him were itat home upon my brothers guard even thereagainst the hospitable canon would Iwash my fierce hand in s heart go you to the tylearn how itis held and what they are that mustbe hostages for Romewill not you goI am attended at the cypress grove I pray youitis south the ty mills bring me word thitherhow the world goes that to the pace of itI may spur on my journeyI shall sirthe augurer tells me we shall have news to-nightgood or badnot according to the prayer of the people for they love not Marusnature teaches beasts to know their friendspray you who does the wolf lovethe lambay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marushes a lamb indeed that baes like a bearhes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask youwell sirwell sirin what enormity is Marus poor in that you two have not in abundancehes poor in no one fault but stored with allespeally in prideand topping all others in boastingthis is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the ty I mean of us ofthe right hand file do youwhy how are we censuredbecause you talk of pride now Will you not be angrywell well sir wellwhy itis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame Marus for being proudwe do it not alone sirI know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone you talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you couldwhat then sirwhy then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in Romemenenius you are known well enough tooI am known to be a humorous patrian and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber init said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough toocome sir come we know you well enoughyou know neither me yourselves nor anything you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller and then rejourn the controversy of three-pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber-pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange onescome come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitolour very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack-saddle yet you must be saying Marus is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen Good den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of youhow now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fasthonourable Menenius my boy Marus approaches for the love of Juno lets goha Marus coming homeay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous approbationtake my cap Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo Marus coming homenay itis truenay itis truelook heres a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and I think theres one at home for youI will make my very house reel to-night a letter for meyes certain theres a letter for you I saw ita letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time I will make a lip at the physian the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse-drench is he not wounded he was wont to come home woundedO no no noO he is wounded I thank the gods foritso do I too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become himon s brows Menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garlandhas he displined Aufidius soundlyTitus Lartius writes they fought together but Aufidius got offand itwas time for him too iull warrant him that an he had stayed by him I would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in CoriolI and the gold thats in them is the senate possessed of thisgood ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doublyin troth theres wondrous things spoke of himwondrous ay I warrant you and not without his true purchasingthe gods grant them truetrue pow wowtrue iull be sworn they are true where is he woundedwhere is he woundedinthe shoulder and inthe left arm there will be large catrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts inthe bodyone inthe neck and two inthe thigh theres nine that I knowhe had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon himnow its twenty-seven every gash was an enemys gravehark the trumpetsthese are the ushers of Marus before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tearsdeath that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth liewhich being advanced declines and then men dieknow Rome that all alone Marus did fightwithin CoriolI gates where he hath wonwith fame a name to Caius Marus thesein honour follows Coriolanuswelcome to Rome renowned Coriolanuswelcome to Rome renowned Coriolanusno more of this it does offend my heartpray now no morelook sir your motherOyou have I know petitioned all the godsfor my prosperitynay my good soldier upmy gentle Marus worthy Caius andby deed-achieving honour newly namedwhat is it Coriolanus must I call theebut O thy wifemy gracious silence hailwouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined homethat weepest to see me triumph ah my dearsuch eyes the widows in CoriolI wearand mothers that lack sonsnow the gods crown theeand live you yetO my sweet lady pardonI know not where to turn O welcome homeand welcome general and yere welcome alla hundred thousand welcomes I could weepand I could laugh I am light and heavy welcomea curse begnaw at very root on s heartthat is not glad to see thee you are threethat Rome should dote on yet by the faith of menwe have some old crab-trees here at home that will notbe grafted to your relish yet welcome warriorswe call a nettle but a nettle andthe faults of fools but follyever rightmenenius ever evergive way there and go onyour hand and yoursere in our own house I do shade my headthe good patrians must be visitedfrom whom I have received not only greetingsbut with them change of honoursI have livedto see inherited my very wishesand the buildings of my fancy onlytheres one thing wanting which I doubt not butour Rome will cast upon theeknow good motherI had rather be their servant in my waythan sway with them in theirson to the capitolall tongues speak of him and the bleared sightsare spectacled to see him your prattling nurseinto a rapture lets her baby crywhile she chats him the kitchen malkin pinsher richest lockram bout her reechy neckclambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windowsare smothered up leads filled and ridges horsedwith variable complexions all agreeingin earnestness to see him seld-shown flamensdo press among the popular throngs and puffto win a vulgar station our veiled damescommit the war of white and damask intheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilof Phoebus burning kisses such a potheras if that whatsoever god who leads himwere slily crept into his human powersand gave him graceful postureon the suddenI warrant him consulthen our office mayduring his power go sleephe cannot temperately transport his honoursfrom where he should begin and end but willlose those he hath wonin that theres comfortdoubt not the commoners for whom we standbut they upon their anent malice willforget with the least cause these his new honourswhich that hell give them make I as little questionas he is proud to doitI heard him swearwere he to stand for consul never would heappear inthe market-place nor on him putthe napless vesture of humilitynor showing as the manner is his woundsto the people beg their stinking breathsitis rightit was his word O he would miss it ratherthan carry it but by the suit ofthe gentry to himand the desire of the noblesI wish no betterthan have him hold that purpose and to put itin executionitis most like he willit shall be to him then as our good willsa sure destructionso it must fall outto him or our authorities for an endwe must suggest the people in what hatredhe still hath held them that to his power he wouldhave made them mules silenced their pleaders anddispropertied their freedoms holding themin human action and capatyof no more soul nor fitness for the worldthan camels in the war who have their provandonly for bearing burdens and sore blowsfor sinking under themthis as you say suggestedat some time when his soaring insolenceshall teach the people which time shall not wantif he be put uponit and thats as easyas to set dogs on sheep will be his fireto kindle their dry stubble and their blazeshall darken him for everwhats the matteryou are sent for to the capitol itis thoughtthat Marus shall be consulI have seen the dumb men throng to see him andthe blind to hear him speak matrons flung glovesladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchersupon him as he passed the nobles bendedas to Joves statue and the commons madea shower and thunder with their caps and shoutsI never saw the likelets to the capitoland carry with usears and eyes for the timebut hearts for the eventhave with youcome come they are almost herehow many stand for consulshipsthree they say but itis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry itthats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common peoplefaith there have been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seeitif he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently btwixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their lovehe hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard itno more of him he is a worthy man make way they are cominghaving determined of the Volsces andto send for Titus Lartius it remainsas the main point of this our after-meetingto gratify his noble service thathath thus stood for his country therefore please youmost reverend and grave elders to desirethe present consul and last generalin our well-found successes to reporta little of that worthy work performedby Caius Marus Coriolanus whomwe meet here both to thank and to rememberwith honours like himselfspeak good Cominiusleave nothing out for length and make us thinkrather our states defective for requitalthan we to stretch it outmasters ofthe peoplewe do request your kindest ears and afteryour loving motion toward the common bodyto yield what passes herewe are conventedupon a pleasing treaty and have heartsinclinable to honour and advancethe theme of our assemblywhich the ratherwe shall be blessed to do if he remembera kinder value of the people thanhe hath hereto prized them atthats off thats offI would you rather had been silent please youto hear Cominius speakmost willinglybut yet my caution was more pertinentthan the rebuke you give ithe loves your peoplebut tie him not to be their bedfellowworthy Cominius speaknay keep your placesit Coriolanus never shame to hearwhat you have nobly doneyour honours pardonI had rather have my wounds to heal againthan hear say how I got themsir I hopemy words disbenched you notno sir yet oftwhen blows have made me stay I fled from wordsyou soothed not therefore hurt not but your peopleI love them as they weighpray now sit downI had rather have one scratch my head inthe sunwhen the alarum were struck than idly sitto hear my nothings monsteredmasters of the peopleyour multiplying spawn how can he flatterthats thousand to one good one when you now seehe had rather venture all his limbs for honourthan one on s ears to hear it proceed CominiusI shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanusshould not be uttered feebly it is heldthat valour is the chiefest virtue andmost dignifies the haver if it bethe man I speak of cannot in the worldbe singly counterpoised At sixteen yearswhen Tarquin made a head for Rome he foughtbeyond the mark of others our then dictatorwhom with all praise I point at saw him fightwhen with his Amazonian chin he drovethe bristled lips before him he bestridan oer-pressed Roman and inthe consuls viewslew three opposers Tarquins self he metand struck him on his knee in that days featswhen he might act the woman in the scenehe proved best man inthe field and for his meedwas brow-bound with the oak his pupil ageman-entered thus he waxed like a seaand in the brunt of seventeen battles sincehe lurched all swords of the garland for this lastbefore and in CoriolI let me sayI cannot speak him home he stopped the fliersand by his rare example made the cowardturn terror into sport as weeds beforea vessel under sail so men obeyedand fell below his stem his sword deaths stampwhere it did mark it took from face to foothe was a thing of blood whose every motionwas timed with dying cries alone he enteredthe mortal gate of the ty which he paintedwith shunless destiny aidless came offand with a sudden re-enforcement struckcoriolI like a planet now alls hiswhen by and by the din of war gan piercehis ready sense then straight his doubled spiritre-quickened what in flesh was fatigateand to the battle came he where he didrun reeking oer the lives of men as ifitwere a perpetual spoil and till we calledboth field and ty ours he never stoodto ease his breast with pantingworthy manhe cannot but with measure fit the honourswhich we devise himour spoils he kicked atand looked upon things precious as they werethe common muck ofthe world he covets lessthan misery itself would give rewardshis deeds with doing them and is contentto spend the time to end ithes right noblelet him be called forcall Coriolanushe doth appearthe senate Coriolanus are well pleasedto make thee consulI do owe them stillmy life and servicesit then remainsthat you do speak to the peopleI do beseech youlet me oerleap that custom for I cannotput on the gown stand naked and entreat themfor my wounds sake to give their suffrage please youthat I may pass this doingsir the peoplemust have their voices neither will they bateone jot of ceremonyput them not to tpray you go fit you to the custom andtake to you as your predecessors haveyour honour with your formit is a partthat I shall blush in acting and might wellbe taken from the peoplemark you thatto brag unto them thus I did and thusshow them the unaching scars which I should hideas if I had received them for the hireof their breath onlydo not stand uponitwe recommend to you tribunes of the peopleour purpose to them and to our noble consulwish we all joy and honourto Coriolanus come all joy and honouryou see how he intends to use the peoplemay they perceive s intent he will require themas if he did contemn what he requestedshould be in them to givecome well inform themof our proceedings here on the market-placeI know they do attend usonce if he do require our voices we ought not to deny himwe may sir if we willwe have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous membersand to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitudewe have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points ofthe compassthink you so Which way do you judge my wit would flynay your wit will not so soon out as another mans will itis strongly wedged up in a block-head but if it were at liberty twould sure southwardwhy that wayto lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for consence sake to help to get thee a wifeyou are never without your tricks you may you mayare you all resolved to give your voices but thats no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier manhere he comes and in a gown of humility mark his behaviour we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes Hes to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and iull direct you how you shall go by himcontent contentO sir you are not right have you not knownthe worthiest men have donetwhat must I sayI pray sir plague uponit I cannot bringmy tongue to such a pace look sir my woundsI got them in my countrys service whensome certain of your brethren roared and ranfrom the noise of our own drums O me the godsyou must not speak of that you must desire themto think upon youthink upon me hang emI would they would forget me like the virtueswhich our divines lose by emyoull mar alliull leave you pray you speak to em I pray youin wholesome mannerbid them wash their facesand keep their teeth cleanso here comes a braceyou know the cause sir of my standing herewe do sir tell us what hath brought you to tmine own desertyour own desertay not mine own desirehow not your own desireno sir itwas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with beggingyou must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by youwell then I pray your price ofthe consulshipthe price is to ask it kindlykindly sir I pray let me ha'tI have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say youyou shall ha'tworthy sira match sir there is in all two worthy voices begged I have your alms adieubut this is something oddan itwere to give again but itis no matterpray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gownyou have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved noblyyour enigmayou have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common peopleyou should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them itis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountifully to the desirers therefore beseech you I may be consulwe hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartilyyou have received many wounds for your countryI will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no furtherthe gods give you joy sir heartilymost sweet voicesbetter it is to die better to starvethan crave the hire which first we do deservewhy in this woolvish toge should I stand hereto beg of Hob and Dick that do appeartheir needless vouches custom calls me to twhat custom wills in all things should we doitthe dust on antique time would lie unsweptand mountainous error be too highly heapedfor truth to oer-peer ratherthan fool it solet the high office and the honour goto one that would do thus I am half throughthe one part suffered the other will I dohere come more voicesyour voices for your voices I have foughtwatched for your voices for your voices bearof wounds two dozen odd battles thrice sixI have seen and heard of for your voices havedone many things some less some more your voicesindeed I would be consulhe has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voicetherefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the peopleamen amengod save thee noble consulworthy voicesyou have stood your limitation and the tribunesendue you with the peoples voice remainsthat in the offial marks invested youanon do meet the senateis this donethe custom of request you have dischargedthe people do admit you and are summonedto meet anon upon your approbationwhere at the senate-housethere Coriolanusmay I change these garmentsyou may sirthat iull straight do and knowing myself againrepair to the senate-houseiull keep you company Will you alongwe stay here for the peoplefare you wellhe has it now and by his looks methinksitis warm ats heartwith a proud heart he worehis humble weeds Will you dismiss the peoplehow now my masters have you chose this manhe has our voices sirwe pray the gods he may deserve your loveamen sir to my poor unworthy noticehe mocked us when he begged our voicescertainlyhe flouted us downrightno itis his kind of speech he did not mock usnot one amongst us save yourself but sayshe used us scornfully he should have showed ushis marks of merit wounds received fors countrywhy so he did I am sureno no no man saw emhe said he had wounds which he could show in privateand with his hat thus waving it in scornI would be consul says he aged custombut by your voices will not so permit meyour voices therefore when we granted thathere was I thank you for your voices thank youyour most sweet voices now you have left your voicesI have no further with you was not this mockerywhy either were you ignorant to seeitor seeing it of such childish friendlinessto yield your voicescould you not have told himas you were lessoned when he had no powerbut was a petty servant to the statehe was your enemy ever spake againstyour liberties and the charters that you bearinthe body of the weal and now arrivinga place of potency and sway ofthe stateif he should still malignantly remainfast foe to the plebeiI your voices mightbe curses to yourselves you should have saidthat as his worthy deeds did claim no lessthan what he stood for so his gracious naturewould think upon you for your voices andtranslate his malice towards you into lovestanding your friendly lordthus to have saidas you were fore-advised had touched his spiritand tried his inclination from him pluckedeither his gracious promise which you mightas cause had called you up have held him toor else it would have galled his surly naturewhich easily endures not articletying him to aught so putting him to rageyou should have taen the advantage of his cholerand passed him unelecteddid you perceivehe did solit you in free contemptwhen he did need your loves and do you thinkthat his contempt shall not be bruising to youwhen he hath power to crush why had your bodiesno heart among you or had you tongues to cryagainst the rectorship of judgmenthave youere now denied the asker and now againof him that did not ask but mock bestowyour sued-for tongueshes not confirmed we may deny him yetand will deny himiull have five hundred voices of that sounday twice five hundred and their friends to piece emget you hence instantly and tell those friendsthey have chose a consul that will from them taketheir liberties make them of no more voicethan dogs that are as often beat for barkingas therefore kept to do solet them assembleand on a safer judgment all revokeyour ignorant election Enforce his prideand his old hate unto you besides forget notwith what contempt he wore the humble weedhow in his suit he scorned you but your lovesthinking upon his services took from youthe apprehension of his present portancewhich most gibingly ungravely he did fashionafter the inveterate hate he bears youlaya fault on us your tribunes that we labouredno impediment between but that you mustcast your election on himsay you chose himmore after our commandment than as guidedby your own true affections and that your mindspre-occupied with what you rather must dothan what you should made you against the grainto voice him consul lay the fault on usay spare us not Say we read lectures to youhow youngly he began to serve his countryhow long continued and what stock he springs ofthe noble house ofthe Marans from whence camethat Ancus Marus Numas daughters sonwho after great Hostilius here was kingof the same house Publius and Quintus werethat our best water brought by conduits hitherand Censorinus that was so surnamedand nobly named so twice being censorwas his great ancestorone thus descendedthat hath beside well in his person wroughtto be set high in place we did commendto your remembrances but you have foundscaling his present bearing with his pastthat hes your fixed enemy and revokeyour sudden approbationsay you neer had done tharp on that still but by our putting onand presently when you have drawn your numberrepair to the capitolwe will so almost allrepent in their electionlet them go onthis mutiny were better put in hazardthan stay past doubt for greaterif as his nature is he fall in ragewith their refusal both observe and answerthe vantage of his angerto the capitol comewe will be there before the stream ofthe peopleand this shall seem as partly itis their ownwhich we have goaded onwardtullus Aufidius then had made new headhe had my lord and that it was which causedour swifter compositionso then the Volsces stand but as at firstready when time shall prompt them to make roadupon s againthey are worn lord consul sothat we shall hardly in our ages seetheir banners wave againsaw you Aufidiuson safe-guard he came to me and did curseagainst the Volsces for they had so vilelyyielded the town he is retired to Antiumspoke he of mehe did my lordhow whathow often he had met you sword to swordthat of all things upon the earth he hatedyour person most that he would pawn his fortunesto hopeless restitution so he mightbe called your vanquisherat Antium lives heat AntiumI wish I had a cause to seek him thereto oppose his hatred fully welcome homebehold these are the tribunes of the peoplethe tongues ofthe common mouth I do despise themfor they do prank them in authorityagainst all noble sufferancepass no furtherha what is thatit will be dangerous to go on no furtherwhat makes this changethe matterhath he not passed the noble and the commoncominius nohave I had childrens voicestribunes give way he shall to the market-placethe people are incensed against himstopor all will fall in broilare these your herdmust these have voices that can yield them nowand straight disclaim their tongues what are your officesyou being their mouths why rule you not their teethhave you not set them onbe calm be calmit is a purposed thing and grows by plotto curb the will of the nobilitysuffert and live with such as cannot rulenor ever will be ruledcallt not a plotthe people cry you mocked them and of latewhen corn was given them gratis you repinedscandalled the suppliants for the people called themtime-pleasers flatterers foes to noblenesswhy this was known beforenot to them allhave you informed them sithencehow I inform themyou are like to do such businessnot unlikeeach way to better yourswhy then should I be consul by yond cloudslet me deserve so ill as you and make meyour fellow tribuneyou show too much of thatfor which the people stir if you will passto where you are bound you must inquire your waywhich you are out of with a gentler spiritor never be so noble as a consulnor yoke with him for tribunelets be calmthe people are abused set on this palteringbecomes not Rome nor has Coriolanusdeserved this so dishonoured rub laid falselyinthe plain way of his merittell me of cornthis was my speech and I will speakt againnot now not nownot in this heat sir nownow as I live I will my nobler friendsI crave their pardonsfor the mutable rank-scented many let themregard me as I do not flatter andtherein behold themselves I say againin soothing them we nourish gainst our senatethe cockle of rebellion insolence seditionwhich we ourselves have ploughed for sowed and scatteredby mingling them with us the honoured numberwho lacked not virtue no nor power but thatwhich they have given to beggarswell no moreno more words we beseech youhow no moreas for my country I have shed my bloodnot fearing outward force so shall my lungscoin words till they decay against those measleswhich we disdain should tetter us yet soughtthe very way to catch themyou speak ofthe peopleas if you were a god to punish nota man of their infirmityitwere wellwe let the people knowtwhat what his cholercholerwere I as patient as the midnight sleepby Jove twould be my mindit is a mindthat shall remain a poison where it isnot poison any furthershall remainhear you this Triton of the minnows mark youhis absolute shall itwas from the canonshall O good but most unwise patrians whyyou grave but reckless senators have you thusgiven Hydra here to choose an officerthat with his peremptory shall being butthe horn and noise ofthe monsters wants not spiritto say hell turn your current in a ditchand make your channel his if he have powerthen vail your ignorance if none awakeyour dangerous lenity if you are learnedbe not as common fools if you are notlet them have cushions by you you are plebeiansif they be senators and they are no lesswhen both your voices blended the greatest tastemost palates theirs they choose their magistrateand such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver benchthan ever frowned in Greece by Jove himselfit makes the consuls base and my soul achesto know when two authorities are upneither supreme how soon confusionmay enter btwixt the gap of both and takethe one by the otherwell on to the market-placewhoever gave that counsel to give forththe corn ofthe store-house gratis as itwas usedsometime in Greecewell well no more of thatthough there the people had more absolute powerI say they nourished disobedience fedthe ruin of the statewhy shall the people giveone that speaks thus their voiceiull give my reasonsmore worthier than their voices they know the cornwas not our recompense resting well assuredthey neer did service forit Being pressed to the wareven when the navel of the state was touchedthey would not thread the gates this kind of servicedid not deserve corn gratis Being inthe wartheir mutinies and revolts wherein they showedmost valour spoke not for them the accusationwhich they have often made against the senateall cause unborn could never be the motiveof our so frank donation well what thenhow shall this bisson multitude digestthe senates courtesy let deeds expresswhats like to be their words we did request itwe are the greater poll and in true fearthey gave us our demands thus we debasethe nature of our seats and make the rabblecall our cares fears which will in time break opethe locks ofthe senate and bring in the crowsto peck the eaglescome enoughenough with over-measureno take morewhat may be sworn by both divine and humanseal what I end withal this double worshipwhere one part does disdain with cause the otherinsult without all reason where gentry title wisdomcannot conclude but by the yea and noof general ignorance it must omitreal necessities and give way the whileto unstable slightness purpose so barred it followsnothing is done to purpose therefore beseech youyou that will be less fearful than discreetthat love the fundamental part of statemore than you doubt the change onit that prefera noble life before a long and wishto jump a body with a dangerous physicthats sure of death without it at once pluck outthe multitudinous tongue let them not lickthe sweet which is their poison your dishonourmangles true judgment and bereaves the stateof that integrity which should become itnot having the power to do the good it wouldfor the ill which doth control the has said enoughhe has spoken like a traitor and shall answeras traitors dothou wretch despite oerwhelm theewhat should the people do with these bald tribuneson whom depending their obedience failsto the greater bench in a rebellionwhen whats not meet but what must be was lawthen were they chosen in a better hourlet what is meet be said it must be meetand throw their power inthe dustmanifest treasonthis a consul nothediles ho let him be apprehendedgo call the peoplein whose name myselfattach thee as a traitorous innovatora foe to the public weal obey I

consent of all we were establishedthe peoples magistratesyou so remainand so are like to dothat is the way to lay the ty flatto bring the roof to the foundationand bury all which yet distinctly rangesin heaps and piles of ruinthis deserves deathor let us stand to our authorityor let us lose it we do here pronounceupon the part ofthe people in whose powerwe were elected theirs Marus is worthyof present deaththerefore lay hold of himbear him to the rock Tarpeian and from thenceinto destruction cast himdiles seize himyield Marus yieldhear me one wordbeseech you tribunes hear me but a wordpeace peacebe that you seem truly your countrys friendsand temperately proceed to what you wouldthus violently redresssir those cold waysthat seem like prudent helps are very poisonouswhere the disease is violent Lay hands upon himand bear him to the rockno iull die heretheres some among you have beheld me fightingcome try upon yourselves what you have seen medown

they are used to bearpray you be goneiull try whether my old wit be in requestwith those that have but little this must be patchedwith cloth of any colournay come awaythis man has marred his fortunehis nature is too noble for the worldhe would not flatter Neptune for his tridentor Jove for s power to thunder his hearts his mouthwhat his breast forges that his tongue must ventand being angry does forget that everhe heard the name of deathheres goodly workI would they were a-bedI would they were in Tiber what the vengeancecould he not speak em fairwhere is this viperthat would depopulate the ty andbe every man himselfyou worthy tribuneshe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockwith rigorous hands he hath resisted lawand therefore law shall scorn him further

where you should but huntwith modest warrantsir how comes'tthat youhave holp to make this rescuehear me speakas I do know the consuls worthinessso can I name his faultsconsul what consulthe consul Coriolanusif by the tribunes leave and yours good peopleI may be heard I would crave a word or twothe which shall turn you to no further harmthan so much loss of timespeak briefly thenfor

countryit honoured himthe service of the footbeing once gangrened is not then respectedfor what before it waswell hear no morepursue him to his house and pluck him thencelest his infection being of catching naturespread furtherone word more one wordthis tiger-footed rage when it shall findthe harm of unscanned swiftness will too latetie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by

first wayiull bring him to youlet me desire your company he must comeor what is worst will followpray you lets to himlet them pull all about mine ears present medeath on the wheel or at wild

they lacked power to cross youlet them hangay and burn toocome come you have been too rough something too roughyou must return and mend ittheres no remedyunless by not so doing our good tycleave in the midst and perishpray be counselledI have a heart of mettle apt as yoursbut yet a brain that leads my use of angerto better vantagewell said noble womanbefore he should thus stoop to the herd but thatthe violent fit ofthe time craves it as physicfor the whole state I would put mine armour onwhich I can scarcely bearwhat must I doreturn to the tribuneswell what then what thenrepent what you have spokefor them I cannot do it to the godsmust I then doit to themyou are too absolutethough therein you can never be too noblebut when extremities speak I have heard you sayhonour and policy like unsevered friendsinthe war do grow together grant that and tell mein peace what each of them by th other losethat they combine not theretush tusha good demandif it be honour in your wars to seemthe same you are not which for your best endsyou adopt your policy how is it less or worsethat it shall hold companionship in peacewith honour as in war since that to bothit stands in like requestwhy force you thisbecause that now it lies you on to speakto the people not by your own instructionnor by the matter which your heart prompts youbut with such words that are but rooted inyour tongue though but bastards and syllablesof no allowance to your bosoms truthnow this no more dishonours you at allthan to take in a town with gentle wordswhich else would put you to your fortune andthe hazard of much bloodI would dissemble with my nature wheremy fortunes and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honour I am in thisyour wife your son these senators the noblesand you will rather show our general loutshow you can frown than spend a fawn upon emfor the inheritance of their loves and safeguardof what that want might ruinnoble ladycome go with us speak fair you may salve sonot what is dangerous present but the lossof what is pastI prithee now my songo to them with this bonnet in thy handand thus far having stretched it here be with themthy knee bussing the stones for in such businessaction is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorantmore learned than the ears waving thy headwhich often thus correcting thy stout heartnow humble as the ripest mulberrythat will not hold the handling or say to themthou art their soldier and being bred in broilshast not the soft way which thou dost confesswere fit for thee to use as they to claimin asking their good loves but thou wilt framethyself forsooth hereafter theirs so faras thou hast power and personthis but doneeven as she speaks why their hearts were yoursfor they have pardons being asked as freeas words to little purposeprithee nowgo and be ruled although I know thou hadst ratherfollow thine enemy in a fiery gulfthan flatter him in a bower here is CominiusI have been inthe market-place and sir itis fityou make strong party or defend yourselfby calmness or by absence alls in angeronly fair speechI think itwill serve if hecan thereto frame his spirithe must and willprithee now say you will and go about itmust I go show them my unbarbed sconcemust I with my base tongue give to my noble hearta lie that it must bear well I will doityet were there but this single plot to losethis mould of Marus they to dust should grind itand throw'tagainst the wind to the market-placeyou have put me now to such a part which neverI shall discharge to the lifecome come well prompt youI prithee now sweet son as thou hast saidmy praises made thee first a soldier soto have my praise for this perform a partthou hast not done beforewell I must doitaway my disposition and possess mesome harlots spirit my throat of war be turnedwhich quired with my drum into a pipesmall as a eunuch or the virgin voicethat babies lulls asleep the smiles of knavestent in my cheeks and school-boys tears take upthe glasses of my sight a beggars tonguemake motion through my lips and my armed kneeswho bowed but in my stirrup bend like histhat hath received an alms I will not doitlest I surcease to honour mine own truthand by my bodys action teach my minda most inherent basenessat thy choice thento beg of thee it is my more dishonourthan thou of them come all to ruin letthy mother rather feel thy pride than fearthy dangerous stoutness for I mock at deathwith as big heart as thou do as thou listthy valiantness was mine thou suckedst it from mebut owe thy pride thyselfpray be contentmother I am going to the market-placechide me no more iull mountebank their lovescog their hearts from them and come home belovedof all the trades in Rome look I am goingcommend me to my wife iull return consulor never trust to what my tongue can dointhe way of flattery furtherdo your willaway the tribunes do attend you arm yourselfto answer mildly for they are preparedwith accusations as I hear more strongthan are upon you yetthe word is mildly pray you let us golet them accuse me by invention Iwill answer in mine honouray but mildlywell mildly be it then Mildlyin this point charge him home that he affectstyrannical power if he evade us thereenforce him with his envy to the peopleand that the spoil got on the Antiateswas neer distributedwhat will he comehes cominghow accompaniedwith old Menenius and those senatorsthat always favoured himhave you a catalogueof all the voices that we have procuredset down by the pollI have itis readyhave you collected them by tribesI haveassemble presently the people hitherand when they hear me say it shall be sointhe right and strength ofthe commons be it eitherfor death for fine or banishment then let themif I say fine cry fine if death cry edeath insisting on the old prerogativeand power inthe truth ofthe causeI shall inform themand when such time they have begun to crylet them not cease but with a din confusedenforce the present executionof what we chance to sentencevery wellmake them be strong and ready for this hintwhen we shall hap to give'tthemgo about itput him to choler straight he hath been usedever to conquer and to have his worthof contradiction being once chafed he cannotbe reined again to temperance then he speakswhats in his heart and that is there which lookswith us to break his neckwell here he comescalmly I do beseech youay as an ostler that for the poorest piecewill bear the knave by the volume the honoured godskeep Rome in safety and the chairs of justicesupplied with worthy men plant love among usthrong our large temples with the shows of

contentlo tizens he says he is contentthe war-like service he has done consider thinkupon the wounds his body bears which showlike graves inthe holy churchyardscratches with briersscars to move laughter onlyconsider furtherthat when he speaks not like a tizenyou find him like a soldier do not takehis rougher accents for malious soundsbut as I say such as become a soldierrather than envy youwell well no morewhat is the matterthat being passed for consul with full voiceI am so dishonoured that the very houryou take it off againanswer to ussay then itis true I ought sowe

main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from

crowsinthe ty of kites and crows what an ass it is then thou dwellest with daws toono I serve not thy masterhow sir do you meddle with my masteray itis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistressthou pratest and pratest serve with thy trencher hencewhere is this fellowhere sir id have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords withinwhence comest thou what wouldst thou thy namewhy speakest not speak man whats thy nameif Tullusnot yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost notthink me for the man I am necessitycommands me name myselfwhat is thy namea name unmusical to the Volsans earsand harsh in sound to thinesay whats thy namethou hast a grim appearance and thy facebears a command init though thy tackles tornthou showest a noble vessel whats thy nameprepare thy brow to frown knowest thou me yetI know thee not thy namemy name is Caius Marus who hath doneto thee particularly and to all the Volscesgreat hurt and mischief thereto witness maymy surname Coriolanus the painful servicethe extreme dangers and the drops of bloodshed for my thankless country are requitedbut with that surname a good memoryand witness of the malice and displeasurewhich thou shouldst bear me only that name remainsthe cruelty and envy of the peoplepermitted by our dastard nobles whohave all forsook me hath devoured the restand suffered me by the voice of slaves to bewhooped out of Rome now this extremityhath brought me to thy hearth not out of hopemistake me not to save my life for ifI had feared death of all the men inthe worldI would have voided thee but in mere spiteto be full quit of those my banishersstand I before thee here then if thou hasta heart of wreak in thee that will revengethine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsof shame seen through thy country speed thee straightand make my misery serve thy turn so use itthat my revengeful services may proveas benefits to thee for I will fightagainst my cankered country with the spleenof all the under fiends but if so bethou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesthou art tired then in a word I also amlonger to live most weary and presentmy throat to thee and to thy anent malicewhich not to cut would show thee but a foolsince I have ever followed thee with hatedrawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breastand cannot live but to thy shame unlessit be to do thee serviceO Marus Maruseach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my hearta root of anent envy if Jupitershould from yond cloud speak divine thingsand say itis true id not believe them morethan thee all noble Marus let me twinemine arms about that body where againstmy grained ash a hundred times hath brokeand scarred the moon with splinters here I clipthe anvil of my sword and do contestas hotly and as nobly with thy loveas ever in ambitious strength I didcontend against thy valour know thou firstI loved the maid I married never mansighed truer breath but that I see thee herethou noble thing more dances my rapt heartthan when I first my wedded mistress sawbestride my threshold why thou Mars I tell theewe have a power on foot and I had purposeonce more to hew thy target from thy brawnor lose mine arm forit thou hast beat me outtwelve several times and I have nightly sincedreamt of encounters btwixt thyself and mewe have been down together in my sleepunbuckling helms fisting each others throatand waked half dead with nothing Worthy Marushad we no quarrel else to Rome but thatthou art thence banished we would muster allfrom twelve to seventy and pouring warinto the bowels of ungrateful Romelike a bold flood oer-bear O come go inand take our friendly senators by the handswho now are here taking their leaves of mewho am prepared against your territoriesthough not for Rome itselfyou bless me godstherefore most absolute sir if thou wilt havethe leading of thine own revenges takethe one half of my commission and set downas best thou art experienced since thou knowestthy countrys strength and weakness thine own wayswhether to knock against the gates of Romeor rudely visit them in parts remoteto fright them ere destroy but come inlet me commend thee first to those that shallsay yea to thy desires a thousand welcomesand more a friend than eer an enemyyet Marus that was much your hand most welcomeheres a strange alterationby my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of himwhat an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a topnay I knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought I cannot tell how to term ithe had so looking as it were would I were hanged but I thought there was more in him than I could thinkso did I iull be sworn he is simply the rarest man inthe worldI think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot onwho my masternay its no matter for thatworth six on himnay not so neither but I take him to be the greater soldierfaith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellentay and for an assault tooO slaves I can tell you news news you rascalswhat what what lets partakewhat what what lets partakeI would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lief be a condemned manwherefore whereforewherefore whereforewhy heres he that was wont to thwack our general Caius Maruswhy do you say thwack our general I do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for himcome we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himselfhe was too hard for him directly to say the truth onit before CoriolI he scotched him and notched him like a carbonadoan he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him toobut more of thy newswhy he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end ofthe table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with s hand and turns up the white ofthe eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is our general is out inthe middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table Hell go he says and sowle the porter of Rome gates by the ears he will mow down all before him and leave his passage polledand hes as like to doit as any man I can imaginedoit he will doit for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst hes in directitudedirectitude whats thatbut when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like comes after rain and revel all with himbut when goes this forwardto-morrow to-day presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon itis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lipswhy then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad-makerslet me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night its spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of menitis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckoldsay and it makes men hate one anotherreason because they then less need one another the wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volsans they are rising they are risingin in in inwe hear not of him neither need we fear himhis remedies are tame inthe present peaceand quietness ofthe people which beforewere in wild hurry here do we make his friendsblush that the world goes well who rather hadthough they themselves did suffer by'tbeholddissentious numbers pestering streets than seeour tradesmen singing in their shops and goingabout their functions friendlywe stood to'tin good time is this Meneniusitis he itis he O he is grown most kindof late Hail sirhail to you bothyour Coriolanus is not much missedbut with his friends the commonwealth doth standand so would do were he more angry at italls well and might have been much better ifhe could have temporizedwhere is he hear younay I hear nothing his mother and his wifehear nothing from himthe gods preserve you bothgood den our neighboursgood den to you all good den to you allourselves our wives and children on our kneesare bound to pray for you bothlive and thrivefarewell kind neighbours we wished Coriolanushad loved you as we didnow the gods keep youfarewell farewellfarewell farewellthis is a happier and more comely timethan when these fellows ran about the streetscrying confusioncaius Marus wasa worthy officer inthe war but insolentoercome with pride ambitious past all thinkingself-lovingand affecting one sole thronewithout assistanceI think not sowe should by this to all our lamentationif he had gone forth consul found it sothe gods have well prevented it and Romesits safe and still without himworthy tribunesthere is a slave whom we have put in prisonreports the Volsces with two several powersare entered in the Roman territoriesand with the deepest malice of the wardestroy what lies before themitis Aufidiuswho hearing of our Marus banishmentthrusts forth his horns again into the worldwhich were inshelled when Marus stood for Romeand durst not once peep outcome what talk you of Marusgo see this rumourer whipped it cannot bethe Volsces dare break with uscannot bewe have record that very well it canand three examples of the like have beenwithin my age but reason with the fellowbefore you punish him where he heard thislest you shall chance to whip your informationand beat the messenger who bids bewareof what is to be dreadedtell not meI know this cannot benot possiblethe nobles in great earnestness are goingall to the senate-house some news is comethat turns their countenancesitis this slavego whip him fore the peoples eyes his raisingnothing but his reportyes worthy sirthe slaves report is seconded and moremore fearful is deliveredwhat more fearfulit is spoke freely out of many mouthshow probable I do not know that Marusjoined with Aufidius leads a power gainst Romeand vows revenge as spaous as betweenthe youngest and oldest thingthis is most likelyraised only that the weaker sort may wishgood Marus home againthe very trick onitthis is unlikelyhe and Aufidius can no more atonethan violentest contrarietyyou are sent for to the senatea fearful army led by Caius Marusassoated with Aufidius ragesupon our territories and have alreadyoerborne their way consumed with fire and tookwhat lay before themO you have made good workwhat news what newsyou have holp to ravish your own daughters andto melt the ty leads upon your patesto see your wives dishonoured to your noseswhats the news whats the newsyour temples burned in their cement andyour franchises whereon you stood confinedinto an augers borepray now your newsyou have made fair work I fear me pray your newsif Marus should be joined with Volsansifhe is their god he leads them like a thingmade by some other deity than naturethat shapes man better and they follow himagainst us brats with no less confidencethan boys pursuing summer butterfliesor butchers killing fliesyou have made good workyou and your apron-men you that stood so muchupon the voice of occupation andthe breath of garlic-eatershe will shakeyour Rome about your earsas Herculesdid shake down mellow fruit you have made fair workbut is this true siray and youll look palebefore you find it other All the regionsdo smilingly revolt and who resistare mocked for valiant ignoranceand perish constant fools who isit can blame himyour enemies and his find something in himwe are all undone unlessthe noble man have mercywho shall ask itthe tribunes cannot doit for shame the peopledeserve such pity of him as the wolfdoes of the shepherds for his best friends if theyshould say be good to Rome they charged him evenas those should do that had deserved his hateand therein showed like enemiesitis trueif he were putting to my house the brandthat should consume it I have not the faceto say Beseech you cease you have made fair handsyou and your crafts you have crafted fairyou have broughta trembling upon Rome such as was neverso incapable of helpsay not we brought itsay not we brought ithow was it we we loved him but like beastsand cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusterswho did hoot him out ofthe tybut I feartheyll roar him in again Tullus Aufidiusthe second name of men obeys his pointsas if he were his officer desperationis all the policy strength and defencethat Rome can make against themhere come the clustersand is Aufidius with him you are theythat made the air unwholesome when you castyour stinking greasy caps in hooting atcoriolanus exile now hes comingand not a hair upon a soldiers headwhich will not prove a whip as many coxcombsas you threw caps up will he tumble downand pay you for your voices itis no matterif he could burn us all into one coalwe have deserved itfaith we hear fearful newsfor mine own partwhen I said banish him I said itwas pityand so did Iand so did I and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our willyoure goodly things you voicesyou have madegood work you and your cry Shalls to the capitolO ay what elsego masters get you home be not dismayedthese are a side that would be glad to havethis true which they so seem to fear go homeand show no sign of fearthe gods be good to us come masters lets home I ever said we were inthe wrong when we banished himso did we all but come lets homeI do not like this newsnor Ilets to the capitol would half my wealthwould buy this for a liepray let us godo they still fly to the RomanI do not know what witchcrafts in him butyour soldiers use him as the grace fore meattheir talk at table and their thanks at endand you are darkened in this action sireven by your ownI cannot help it nowunless by using means I lame the footof our design he bears himself more proudliereven to my person than I thought he wouldwhen first I did embrace him yet his naturein thats no changeling and I must excusewhat cannot be amendedyet I wish sirI mean for your particular you had notjoined in commission with him but eitherhad borne the action of yourself or elseto him had left it solelyI understand thee well and be thou surewhen he shall come to his account he knows notwhat I can urge against him although it seemsand so he thinks and is no less apparentto the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairlyand shows good husbandry for the Volsan statefights dragon-like and does achieve as soonas draw his sword yet he hath left undonethat which shall break his neck or hazard minewheneer we come to our accountsir I beseech you think you hell carry Romeall places yield to him ere he sits downand the nobility of Rome are histhe senators and patrians love him toothe tribunes are no soldiers and their peoplewill be as rash in the repeal as hastyto expel him thence I think hell be to Romeas is the osprey to the fish who takes itby sovereignty of nature first he wasa noble servant to them but he could notcarry his honours even whether itwas pridewhich out of daily fortune ever taintsthe happy man whether defect of judgmentto fail in the disposing of those chanceswhich he was lord of or whether naturenot to be other than one thing not movingfrom the casque to the cushion but commanding peaceeven with the same austerity and garbas he controlled the war but one of theseas he hath spices of them all not allfor I dare so far free him made him fearedso hated and so banished but he has a meritto choke it in the utterance so our virtueslie in the interpretation of the timeand power unto itself most commendablehath not a tomb so evident as a chairto extol what it hath doneone fire drives out one fire one nail one nailrights by rights falter strengths by strengths do failcome lets away when Caius Rome is thinethou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mineno iull not go you hear what he hath saidwhich was sometime his general who loved himin a most dear particular he called me fatherbut what o that go you that banished hima mile before his tent fall down and kneethe way into his mercy nay if he coyedto hear Cominius speak iull keep at homehe would not seem to know medo you hearyet one time he did call me by my nameI urged our old acquaintance and the dropsthat we have bled together Coriolanushe would not answer to forbad all nameshe was a kind of nothing titlelesstill he had forged himself a name ofthe fireof burning Romewhy so you have made good worka pair of tribunes that have racked for Rometo make coals cheap a noble memoryI minded him how royal itwas to pardonwhen it was less expected he repliedit was a bare petition of a stateto one whom they had punishedvery wellcould he say lessI offered to awaken his regardfors private friends his answer to me washe could not stay to pick them in a pileof noisome musty chaff he said itwas follyfor one poor grain or two to leave unburntand still to nose the offencefor one poor grain or twoI am one of those his mother wife his childand this brave fellow too we are the grainsyou are the musty chaff and you are smeltabove the moon we must be burnt for younay pray be patient if you refuse your aidin this so-never-needed help yet do notupbraids with our distress but sure if youwould be your countrys pleader your good tonguemore than the instant army we can makemight stop our countrymanno iull not meddlepray you go to himwhat should I doonly make trial what your love can dofor Rome towards Maruswell and say that Marusreturn me as Cominius is returnedunheard what thenbut as a discontented friend grief-shotwith his unkindness say'tbe soyet your good willmust have that thanks from Rome after the measureas you intended welliull undertake itI think hell hear me yet to bite his lipand hum at good Cominius much unhearts mehe was not taken well he had not dinedthe veins unfilled our blood is cold and thenwe pout upon the morning are unaptto give or to forgive but when we have stuffedthese pipes and these conveyances of our bloodwith wine and feeding we have suppler soulsthan in our priest-like fasts therefore iull watch himtill he be dieted to my requestand then iull set upon himyou know the very road into his kindnessand cannot lose your waygood faith iull prove himspeed how it will I shall ere long have knowledgeof my successhell never hear himnotI tell you he does sit in gold his eyered as twould burn Rome and his injurythe gaoler to his pity I kneeled before himitwas very faintly he said Rise dismissed methus with his speechless hand what he would dohe sent in writing after me what he would notbound with an oath to yield to his conditionsso that all hope is vainunless his noble mother and his wifewho as I hear mean to solit himfor mercy to his country therefore lets henceand with our fair entreaties haste them onstay whence are youstand and go backyou guard like men itis well but by your leaveI am an officer of state and cometo speak with Coriolanusfrom whencefrom Romeyou may not pass you must return our generalwill no more hear from thenceyoull see your Rome embraced with fire beforeyoull speak with Coriolanusgood my friendsif you have heard your general talk of Romeand of his friends there it is lots to blanksmy name hath touched your ears it is Meneniusbe it so go back the virtue of your nameis not here passableI tell thee fellowthy general is my lover I have beenthe book of his good acts whence men have readhis fame unparalleled haply amplifiedfor I have ever glorified my friendsof whom hes chief with all the size that veritywould without lapsing suffer nay sometimeslike to a bowl upon a subtle groundI have tumbled past the throw and in his praisehave almost stamped the leasing therefore fellowI must have leave to passfaith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go backprithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your generalhowsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass therefore go backhas he dined canst thou tell for I would not speak with him till after dinneryou are a Roman are youI am as thy general isthen you should hate Rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your ty is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardonsirrah if thy captain know I were here he would use me with estimationcome my captain knows you notI mean thy generalmy general cares not for youback I say go lest I let forth your half-pint of blood back thats the utmost of your having backnay but fellow fellowwhats the matternow you companion iull say an errand for you you shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not inthe state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swound for whats to come upon theethe glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to theeawayhow awaywife mother child I know not my affairsare servanted to others though I owemy revenge properly my remission liesin Volsan breasts that we have been familiaringrate forgetfulness shall poison ratherthan pity note how much therefore be

so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age I say to you as I was said to awaya noble fellow I warrant himthe worthy fellow is our general he is the rock the oak not to be wind-shakenwe will before the walls of Rome to-morrowset down our host my partner in this actionyou must report to the Volsan lords how plainlyI have borne this businessonly their endsyou have respected stopped your ears againstthe general suit of Rome never admitteda private whisper no not with such friendsthat thought them sure of youthis last old manwhom with a cracked heart I have sent to Romeloved me above the measure of a fathernay godded me indeed Their latest refugewas to send him for whose old love I havethough I showed sourly to him once more offeredthe first conditions which they did refuseand cannot now accept to grace him onlythat thought he could do more a very littleI have yielded to fresh embassies and suitsnor from the state nor private friends hereafterwill I lend ear toha what shout is thisshall I be tempted to infringe my vowin the same time itis made I will notmy wife comes foremost then the honoured mouldwherein this trunk was framed and in her handthe grandchild to her blood but out affectionall bond and privilege of nature breaklet it be virtuous to be obstinatewhat is that curtsy worth or those doves eyeswhich can make gods forsworn I melt and am notof stronger earth than others my mother bowsas if Olympus to a molehill shouldin supplication nod and my young boyhath an aspect of intercession whichgreat nature cries edeny not let the Volscesplough Rome and harrow Italy iull neverbe such a gosling to obey instinct but standas if a man were author of himselfand knew no other kinmy lord and husbandthese eyes are not the same I wore in Romethe sorrow that delivers us thus changedmakes you think solike a dull actor nowI have forgot my part and I am outeven to a full disgrace Best of my fleshforgive my tyranny but do not sayfor that forgive our Romans O a kisslong as my exile sweet as my revengenow by the jealous queen of heaven that kissI carried from thee dear and my true liphath virgined it eer since you gods I prateand the most noble mother of the worldleave unsaluted sink my knee inthe earthof thy deep duty more impression showthan that of common sonsO stand up blessedwhilst with no softer cushion than the flintI kneel before thee and unproperlyshow duty as mistaken all this whilebetween the child and parentwhat is thisyour knees to me to your corrected sonthen let the pebbles on the hungry beachfillip the stars then let the mutinous windsstrike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sunmurdring impossibility to makewhat cannot be slight workthou art my warriorI holp to frame thee do you know this ladythe noble sister of Publicolathe moon of Rome chaste as the iclethats curdied by the frost from purest snowand hangs on Dians temple dear Valeriathis is a poor epitome of yourswhich by the interpretation of full timemay show like all yourselfthe god of soldierswith the consent of supreme Jove informthy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst proveto shame unvulnerable and stick inthe warslike a great sea-mark standing every flawand saving those that eye theeyour knee sirrahthats my brave boyeven he your wife this lady and myselfare suitors to youI beseech you peaceor if youed ask remember this beforethe things I have forsworn to grant may neverbe held by you denials do not bid medismiss my soldiers or capitulateagain with Romes mechanics tell me notwherein I seem unnatural desire notto allay my rages and revenges withyour colder reasonsO no more no moreyou have said you will not grant us any thingfor we have nothing else to ask but thatwhich you deny already yet we will askthat if you fail in our request the blamemay hang upon your hardness therefore hear usaufidius and you Volsces mark for wellhear nought from Rome in private your requestshould we be silent and not speak our raimentand state of bodies would bewray what lifewe have led since thy exile think with thyselfhow more unfortunate than all living womenare we come hither since that thy sight which shouldmake our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comfortsconstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrowmaking the mother wife and child to seethe son the husband and the father tearinghis countrys bowels out and to poor wethine enmitys most capital thou barrest usour prayers to the gods which is a comfortthat all but we enjoy for how can wealas how can we for our country praywhereto we are bound together with thy victorywhereto we are bound Alack or we must losethe country our dear nurse or else thy personour comfort in the country we must findan evident calamity though we hadour wish which side should win for either thoumust as a foreign recreant be ledwith manacles through our streets or elsetriumphantly tread on thy countrys ruinand bear the palm for having bravely shedthy wife and childrens blood for myself sonI purpose not to wait on fortune tillthese wars determine if I cannot persuade theerather to show a noble grace to both partsthan seek the end of one thou shalt no soonermarch to assault thy country than to treadtrust toit thou shalt not on thy mothers wombthat brought thee to this worlday and minethat brought you forth this boy to keep your nameliving to timea shall not tread on meiull run away till I am bigger but then iull fightnot of a womans tenderness to berequires nor child nor womans face to seeI have sat too longnay go not from us thusif it were so that our request did tendto save the Romans thereby to destroythe Volsces whom you serve you might condemn usas poisonous of your honour no our suitis that you reconle them while the Volscesmay say this mercy we have showed the Romansthis we received and each in either sidegive the all-hail to thee and cry be blessedfor making up this peace thou knowest great sonthe end of wars uncertain but this certainthat if thou conquer Rome the benefitwhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a namewhose repetition will be dogged with curseswhose chronicle thus writ the man was noblebut with his last attempt he wiped it outdestroyed his country and his name remainsto the ensuing age abhorred speak to me sonthou hast affected the fine strains of honourto imitate the graces of the godsto tear with thunder the wide cheeks ofthe airand yet to charge thy sulphur with a boltthat should but rive an oak why dost not speakthinkest thou it honourable for a noble manstill to remember wrongs Daughter speak youhe cares not for your weeping speak thou boyperhaps thy childishness will move him morethan can our reasons there is no man in the worldmore bound to s mother yet here he lets me pratelike one inthe stocks thou hast never in thy lifeshowed thy dear mother any courtesywhen she poor hen fond of no second broodhas clucked thee to the wars and safely homeloaden with honour Say my requests unjustand spurn me back but if it be not sothou art not honest and the gods will plague theethat thou restrainest from me the duty whichto a mothers part belongs he turns awaydown ladies let us shame him with our kneesto his surname Coriolanus longs more pridethan pity to our prayers Down an endthis is the last so we will home to Romeand die among our neighbours nay behold usthis boy that cannot tell what he would havebut kneels and holds up hands for fellowshipdoes reason our petition with more strengththan thou hast to deny'tcome let us gothis fellow had a Volsan to his motherhis wife is in CoriolI and his childlike him by chance yet give us our dispatchI am hushed until our ty be a-fireand then iull speak a littleO mother motherwhat have you done behold the heavens do opethe gods look down and this unnatural scenethey laugh at O my mother mother Oyou have won a happy victory to Romebut for your son believe it O believe itmost dangerously you have with him prevailedif not most mortal to him but let it comeaufidius though I cannot make true warsiull frame convenient peace now good Aufidiuswere you in my stead would you have hearda mother less or granted less AufidiusI was moved withalI dare be sworn you wereand sir it is no little thing to makemine eyes to sweat compassion but good sirwhat peace youll make advise me for my partiull not to Rome iull back with you and pray youstand to me in this cause O mother wifeI

peacesee you yond coign ofthe capitol yond corner-stonewhy what of thatif it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome espeally his mother may prevail with him but I say there is no hope init our throats are sentenced and stay upon executionisit possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a manthere is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this Marus is grown from man to dragon he has wings hes more than a creeping thinghe loved his mother dearlyso did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne inyes mercy if you report him trulyI paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor ty find and all this is long of youthe gods be good unto usno in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not ussir if youed save your life fly to your housethe plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneand hale him up and down all swearing ifthe Roman ladies bring not comfort hometheyll give him death by incheswhats the newsgood news good news the ladies have prevailedthe Volsans are dislodged and Marus gonea merrier day did never yet greet Romeno not the expulsion of the Tarquinsfriendart thou certain this is true is it most certainas certain as I know the sun is firewhere have you lurked that you make doubt of itneer through an arch so hurried the blown tideas the recomforted through the gates why hark youthe trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifestabors and cymbals and the shouting Romansmake the sun dance hark youthis is good newsI will go

banished Marusrepeal him with the welcome of his mothercry welcome ladies welcome welcome ladieswelcomego tell the lords ofthe ty I am heredeliver them this paper having read itbid them repair to the market-place where Ieven in theirs and in the commons earswill vouch the truth of it him I accusethe ty ports by this hath entered andintends to appear before the people hopingto purge himself with words dispatchmost welcomehow is it with our generaleven soas with a man by his own alms empoisonedand with his charity slainmost noble sirif you do hold the same intent whereinyou wished us parties well deliver youof your great dangersir I cannot tellwe must proceed as we do find the peoplethe people will remain uncertain whilstbtwixt you theres difference but the fall of eithermakes the survivor heir of allI know itand my pretext to strike at him admitsa good construction I raised him and I pawnedmine honour for his truth who being so heightenedhe watered his new plants with dews of flatterysedung so my friends and to this endhe bowed his nature never known beforebut to be rough unswayable and freesir his stoutnesswhen he did stand for consul which he lostby lack of stoopingthat I would have spoke ofbeing banished forit he came unto my hearthpresented to my knife his throat I took himmade him joint-servant with me gave him wayin all his own desires nay let him chooseout of my files his projects to accomplishmy best and freshest men served his designmentsin mine own person holp to reap the famewhich he did end all his and took some prideto do myself this wrong till at the lastI seemed his follower not partner andhe waged me with his countenance as ifI had been mercenaryso he did my lordthe army marvelled at it and in the lastwhen we had carried Rome and that we lookedfor no less spoil than glorythere was itfor which my sinews shall be stretched upon himat a few drops of womens rheum which areas cheap as lies he sold the blood and labourof our great action therefore shall he dieand iull renew me in his fall but harkyour native town you entered like a postand had no welcomes home but he returnssplitting the air with noiseand patient foolswhose children he hath slain their base throats tearwith giving him glorytherefore at your vantageere he express himself or move the peoplewith what he would say let him feel your swordwhich we will second when he lies alongafter your way his tale pronounced shall buryhis reasons with his bodysay no morehere come the lordsyou are most welcome homeI have not deserved itbut worthy lords have you with heed perusedwhat I have written to youwe haveand grieve to hear twhat faults he made before the last I thinkmight have found easy fines but there to endwhere he was to begin and give awaythe benefit of our levies answering uswith our own charge making a treaty wherethere was a yielding this admits no excusehe approaches you shall hear himhail lords I am returned your soldierno more infected with my countrys lovethan when I parted hence but still subsistingunder your great command you are to knowthat prosperously I have attempted andwith bloody passage led your wars even tothe gates of Rome our spoils we have brought homedo more than counterpoise a full third partthe charges of the action we have made peacewith no less honour to the Antiatesthan shame to the Romans and we here deliversubscribed by the consuls and patrianstogether with the seal ofthe senate whatwe have compounded onread it not noble lordsbut tell the traitor in the highest degreehe hath abused your powerstraitor how noway traitor Marusmarusay Marus Caius Marus dost thou thinkiull grace thee with that robbery thy stoln namecoriolanus in CoriolIyou lords and heads of the state perfidiouslyhe has betrayed your business and given upfor certain drops of salt your ty RomeI say your ty to his wife and motherbreaking his oath and resolution likea twist of rotten silk never admittingcounsel ofthe war but at his nurses tearshe whined and roared away your victorythat pages blushed at him and men of heartlooked wondering each at otherhearest thou Marsname not the god thou boy of tearshano moremeasureless liar thou hast made my hearttoo great for what contains it boy O slavepardon me lords itis the first time that everI was forced to scold your judgments my grave lordsmust give this cur the lie and his own notionwho wears my stripes impressed upon him thatmust bear my beating to his grave shall jointo thrust the lie unto himpeace both and hear me speakcut me to pieces Volsces men and ladsstain all your edges on me boy false houndif you have writ your annals true itis therethat like an eagle in a dove-cote Ifluttered your Volsans in CoriolIalone I did it boywhy noble lordswill you be put in mind of his blind fortunewhich was your shame by this unholy braggartfore your own eyes and earslet him die forittear him to pieces do it presently he killed my son my daughter he killed my cousin Marcus he killed my fatherpeace ho no outrage

uphelp three ofthe chiefest soldiers iull be onebeat thou the drum that it speak mournfullytrail your steel pikes though in this ty hehath widowed and unchilded many a onewhich to this hour bewail the injuryyet he shall have a noble memoryassisthamlet Prince of Denmarkghost of Hamlets fatherwhos therenay answer me stand and unfold yourselflong live the kingbernardoheyou come most carefully upon your houritis now struck twelve get thee to bed Franscofor this relief much thanks itis bitter coldand I am sick at hearthave you had quiet guardnot a mouse stirringwell good-nightif you do meet Horatio and Marcellusthe rivals of my watch bid them make hasieI think I hear them Stand ho whos therefriends to this groundand liegemen to the Danegive you good-nightO farewell honest soldierwho hath relieved youbernardo has my placegive you good-nightholla Bernardosaywhat is Horatio therea piece of himwelcome Horatio welcome good Marcelluswhat has this thing appeared again to-nightI have seen nothinghoratio says itis but our fantasyand will not let belief take hold of himtouching this dreaded sight twice seen of ustherefore I have entreated him alongwith us to watch the minutes of this nightthat if again this apparition comehe may approve our eyes and speak to ittush tush itwill not appearsit down awhileand let us once again assail your earsthat are so fortified against our storywhat we two nights have seenwell sit we downand let us hear Bernardo speak of thislast night of allwhen yond same star thats westward from the polehad made his course to illume that part of heavenwhere now it burns Marcellus and myselfthe bell then beating onepeace break thee off look where it comes againin the same figure like the king thats deadthou art a scholar speak to it Horatiolooks it not like the king mark it Horatiomost like it harrows me with fear and wonderit would be spoke toquestion it Horatiowhat art thou that usurpest this time of nighttogether with that fair and war-like formin which the majesty of buried Denmarkdid sometimes march by heaven I charge thee speakit is offendedsee it stalks awaystay speak speak I charge thee speakitis gone and will not answerhow now Horatio you tremble and look paleis not this something more than fantasywhat think you onitbefore my God I might not this believewithout the sensible and true avouchof mine own eyesis it not like the kingas thou-art to thyselfsuch was the very armour he had onwhen he the ambitious norway combatedso frowned he once when in an angry parlehe smote the sledded Polacks on the iceitis strangethus twice before and jump at this dead hourwith martial stalk hath he gone by our watchin what particular thought to work I know notbut in the gross and scope of my opinionthis bodes some strange eruption to our stategood now sit down and tell me he that knowswhy this same strict and most observant watchso nightly toils the subject of the landand why such daily cast of brazen cannonand foreign mart for implements of warwhy such impress of shipwrights whose sore taskdoes not divide the Sunday from the weekwhat might be toward that this sweaty hastedoth make the night joint-labourer with the daywho is it that can inform methat can Iat least the whisper goes so our last kingwhose image even but now appeared to uswas as you know by fortinbras of norwaythereto pricked on by a most emulate pridedared to the combat in which our valiant Hamletfor so this side of our known world esteemed himdid slay this fortinbras who by a sealed compactwell ratified by law and heraldrydid forfeit with his life all those his landswhich he stood seized of to the conqueroragainst the which a moiety competentwas gaged by our king which had returnedto the inheritance of fortinbrashad he been vanquisher as by the same covenantand carriage of the article designedhis fell to Hamlet now sir young fortinbrasof unimproved mettle hot and fullhath in the skirts of norway here and theresharked up a list of lawless resolutesfor food and diet to some enterprisethat hath a stomach init which is no otheras it doth well appear unto our statebut to recover of us by strong handand terms compulsative those foresaid landsso by his father lost and this I take itis the main motive of our preparationsthe source of this our watch and the chief headof this post-haste and romage in the landI think it be no other but een sowell may it sort that this portentous figurecomes armed through our watch so like the kingthat was and is the question of these warsa mote it is to trouble the minds eyein the most high and palmy state of Romea little ere the mightiest Julius fellthe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deaddid squeak and gibber in the Roman streetsas stars with trains of fire and dews of blooddisasters in the sun and the moist starupon whose influence Neptunes empire standswas sick almost to doomsday with eclipseand even the like precurse of fierce eventsas harbingers preceding still the fatesand prologue to the omen coming onhave heaven and earth together demonstratedunto our climatures and countrymenbut soft behold lo where it comes againiull cross it though it blast me Stay illusionif thou hast any sound or use of voicespeak to meif there be any good thing to be donethat may to thee do ease and grace to mespeak to meif thou art privy to thy countrys fatewhich happily foreknowing may avoidO speakor if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeextorted treasure in the womb of earthfor which they say you spirits oft walk in deathspeak of it stay and speak Stop it Marcellusshall I strike at it with my partisando if it will not standitis hereitis hereitis gonewe do it wrong being so majesticalto offer it the show of violencefor it is as the air invulnerableand our vain blows malious mockeryit was about to speak when the cock crewand then it started like a guilty thingupon a fearful summons I have heardthe cock that is the trumpet to the morndoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatawake the god of day and at his warningwhether in sea or fire in earth or airthe extravagant and erring spirit hiesto his confine and of the truth hereinthis present object made probationit faded on the crowing of the cocksome say that ever gainst that season comeswherein our Saviours birth is celebratedthe bird of dawning singeth all night longand then they say no spirit can walk abroadthe nights are wholesome then no planets strikeno fairy takes nor witch hath power to charmso hallowed and so gracious is the timeso have I heard and do in part believe itbut look the morn in russet mantle cladwalks oer the dew of yon high eastern hillbreak we our watch up and by my advicelet us impart what we have seen to-nightunto young Hamlet for upon my lifethis spirit dumb to us will speak to himdo you consent we shall acquaint him with itas needful in our loves fitting our dutylets doit I pray and I this morning knowwhere we shall find him most convenientlythough yet of Hamlet our dear brothers deaththe memory be green and that it us befittedto bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomto be contracted in one brow of woeyet so far hath discretion fought with naturethat we with wisest sorrow think on himtogether with remembrance of ourselvestherefore our sometime sister now our queenthe imperial jointress of this war-like statehave we as itwere with a defeated joywith one auspious and one dropping eyewith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriagein equal scale weighing delight and doletaken to wife nor have we herein barredyour better wisdoms which have freely gonewith this affair along for all our thanksnow follows that you know young fortinbrasholding a weak supposal of our worthor thinking by our late dear brothers deathour state to be disjoint and out of framecolleagued with the dream of his advantagehe hath not failed to pester us with messageimporting the surrender of those landslost by his father with all bands of lawto our most valiant brother so much for himnow for ourself and for this time of meetingthus much the business is we have here writto norway uncle of young fortinbraswho impotent and bed-rid scarcely hearsof this his nephews purpose to suppresshis further gait herein in that the leviesthe lists and full proportions are all madeout of his subject and we here dispatchyou good Cornelius and you Voltimandfor bearers of this greeting to old norwaygiving to you no further personal powerto business with the king more than the scopeof these delated articles allowfarewell and let your haste commend your dutyin that and all things will we show our dutyin that and all things will we show our dutywe doubt it nothing heartily farewelland now Laertes whats the news with youyou told us of some suit what isit Laertesyou cannot speak of reason to the Daneand lose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertesthat shall not be my offer not thy askingthe head is not more native to the heartthe hand more instrumental to the mouththan is the throne of Denmark to thy fatherwhat wouldst thou have Laertesdread my lordyour leave and favour to return to Francefrom whence though willingly I came to Denmarkto show my duty in your coronationyet now I must confess that duty donemy thoughts and wishes bend again toward Franceand bow them to your gracious leave and pardonhave you your fathers leave what says Poloniushe hath my lord wrung from me my slow leaveby laboursome petition and at lastupon his will I sealed my hard consentI do beseech you give him leave to gotake thy fair hour Laertes time be thineand thy best graces spend it at thy willbut now my cousin Hamlet and my sona little more than kin and less than kindhow is it that the clouds still hang on younot so my lord I am too much inthe sungood Hamlet cast thy nighted colour offand let thine eye look like a friend on Denmarkdo not for ever with thy vailed lidsseek for thy noble father in the dustthou knowest itis common all that live must diepassing through nature to eternityay madam it is commonif it bewhy seems it so particular with theeseems madam nay it is I know not seems itis not alone my inky cloak good mothernor customary suits of solemn blacknor windy suspiration of forced breathno nor the fruitful river in the eyenor the dejected haviour of the visagetogether with all forms modes shows of griefthat can denote me truly these indeed seemfor they are actions that a man might playbut I have that within which passeth showthese but the trappings and the suits of woeitis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamletto give these mourning duties to your fatherbut you must know your father lost a fatherthat father lost lost his and the survivor boundin filial obligation for some termto do obsequious sorrow but to perseverin obstinate condolement is a courseof impious stubbornness itis unmanly griefit shows a will most incorrect to heavena heart unfortified a mind impatientan understanding simple and unschooledfor what we know must be and is as commonas any the most vulgar thing to sensewhy should we in our peevish oppositiontake it to heart fie itis a fault to heavena fault against the dead a fault to natureto reason most absurd whose common themeis death of fathers and who still hath criedfrom the first corse till he that died to-daythis must be so we pray you throw to earththis unprevailing woe and think of usas of a father for let the world take noteyou are the most immediate to our throneand with no less nobility of lovethan that which dearest father bears his sondo I impart toward you for your intentin going back to school in Wittenbergit is most retrograde to our desireand we beseech you bend you to remainhere in the cheer and comfort of our eyeour chiefest courtier cousin and our sonlet not thy mother lose her prayers HamletI pray thee stay with us go not to WittenbergI shall in all my best obey you madamwhy itis a loving and a fair replybe as ourself in Denmark madam comethis gentle and unforced accord of Hamletsits smiling to my heart in grace whereofno jocund health that Denmark drinks to-daybut the great cannon to the clouds shall telland the kings rouse the heavens shall bruit againre-speaking earthly thunder come awayO that this too too solid flesh would meltthaw and resolve itself into a dewor that the Everlasting had not fixedhis canon gainst self-slaughter O God O Godhow weary stale flat and unprofitableseem to me all the uses of this worldfie onit O fie itis an unweeded gardenthat grows to seed things rank and gross in naturepossess it merely that it should come to thisbut two months dead nay not so much not twoso excellent a king that was to thishyperion to a satyr so loving to my motherthat he might not beteem the winds of heavenvisit her face too roughly Heaven and earthmust I remember why she would hang on himas if increase of appetite had grownby what it fed on and yet within a monthlet me not think onit Frailty thy name is womana little month or ere those shoes were oldwith which she followed my poor fathers bodylike Niobe all tears why she even sheO God a beast that wants discourse of reasonwould have mourned longer married with mine unclemy fathers brother but no more like my fatherthan I to Hercules within a monthere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearshad left the flushing in her galled eyesshe married O most wicked speed to postwith such dexterity to incestuous sheetsit is not nor it cannot come to goodbut break my heart for I must hold my tonguehail to your lordshipI am glad to see you wellhoratio or I do forget myselfthe same my lord and your poor servant eversir my good friend iull change that name with youand what make you from Wittenberg Horatiomarcellusmy good lordI am very glad to see yougood even sirbut what in faith make you from Wittenberga truant disposition good my lordI would not hear your enemy say sonor shall you do mine ear that violenceto make it truster of your own reportagainst yourself I know you are no truantbut what is your affair in Elsinorewell teach you to drink deep ere you departmy lord I came to see your fathers funeralI pray thee do not mock me fellow-studentI think it was to see my mothers weddingindeed my lord it followed hard uponthrift thrift Horatio the funeral baked meatsdid coldly furnish forth the marriage tableswould I had met my dearest foe in heavenere I had ever seen that day Horatiomy father methinks I see my fatherO where my lordin my minds eye HoratioI saw him once he was a goodly kinghe was a man take him for all in allI shall not look upon his like againmy lord I think I saw him yesternightsaw whomy lord the king your fatherthe king my fatherseason your admiration for a whilewith an attent ear till I may deliverupon the witness of these gentlementhis marvel to youfor Gods love let me heartwo nights together had these gentlemenmarcellus and Bernardo on their watchin the dead vast and middle of the nightbeen thus encountered a figure like your fatherarmed at points exactly cap-a-peappears before them and with solemn marchgoes slow and stately by them thrice he walkedby their oppressed and fear-surprised eyeswithin his truncheons length whilst they distilledalmost to jelly with the act of fearstand dumb and speak not to him this to mein dreadful secrecy impart they didand I with them the third night kept the watchwhere as they had delivered both in timeform of the thing each word made true and goodthe apparition comes I knew your fatherthese hands are not more likebut where was thismy lord upon the platform where we watcheddid you not speak to itmy lord I didbut answer made it none yet once methoughtit lifted up its head and did addressitself to motion like as it would speakbut even then the morning cock crew loudand at the sound it shrunk in haste awayand vanished from our sightitis very strangeas I do live my honoured lord itis trueand we did think it writ down in our dutyto let you know of itindeed indeed sirs but this troubles mehold you the watch to-nightwe do my lordwe do my lordarmed say youarmed my lordarmed my lordfrom top to toemy lord from head to footmy lord from head to footthen saw you not his faceO yes my lord he wore his beaver upwhat looked he frowninglya countenance more in sorrow than in angerpale or rednay very paleand fixed his eyes upon youmost constantlyI would I had been thereit would have much amazed youvery like very like Stayed it longwhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundredlonger longerlonger longernot when I saw ithis beard was grizzled noit was as I have seen it in his lifea sable silveredI will watch to-nightperchance itwill walk againI warrant it willif it assume my noble fathers personiull speak to it though hell itself should gapeand bid me hold my peace I pray you allif you have hitherto concealed this sightlet it be tenable in your silence stilland whatsoever else shall hap to-nightgive it an understanding but no tongueI will requite your loves so fare you wellupon the platform btwixt eleven and twelveiull visit youour duty to your honouryour loves as mine to you farewellmy fathers spirit in arms all is not wellI doubt some foul play would the night were cometill then sit still my soul foul deeds will risethough all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyesmy necessaries are embarked farewelland sister as the winds give benefitand convoy is assistant do not sleepbut let me hear from youdo you doubt thatfor Hamlet and the trifling of his favourhold it a fashion and a toy in blooda violet in the youth of primy natureforward not permanent sweet not lastingthe perfume and suppliance of a minuteno moreno more but sothink it no morefor nature crescent does not grow alonein thews and bulk but as this temple waxesthe inward service of the mind and soulgrows wide withal Perhaps he loves you nowand now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchthe virtue of his will but you must fearhis greatness weighed his will is not his ownfor he himself is subject to his birthhe may not as unvalued persons docarve for himself for on his choice dependsthe safety and the health of the whole stateand therefore must his choice be rcumscribedunto the voice and yielding of that bodywhereof he is the head then if he says he loves youit fits your wisdom so far to believe itas he in his particular act and placemay give his saying deed which is no furtherthan the main voice of Denmark goes withalthen weigh what loss your honour may sustainif with too credent ear you list his songsor lose your heart or your chaste treasure opento his unmastered importunityfear it Ophelia fear it my dear sisterand keep you in the rear of your affectionout of the shot and danger of desirethe chariest maid is prodigal enoughif she unmask her beauty to the moonvirtue herself scapes not calumnious strokesthe canker galls the infants of the springtoo oft before their buttons be disclosedand in the morn and liquid dew of youthcontagious blastments are most imminentbe wary then best safety lies in fearyouth to itself rebels though none else nearI shall th effect of this good lesson keepas watchman to my heart but good my brotherdo not as some ungracious pastors doshow me the steep and thorny way to heavenwhiles like a puffed and reckless libertinehimself the primrose path of dalliance treadsand recks not his own redeO fear me notI stay too long but here my father comesa double blessing is a double graceoccasion smiles upon a second leaveyet here Laertes aboard aboard for shamethe wind sits in the shoulder of your sailand you are stayed for there my blessing with theeand these few precepts in thy memorylook thou character give thy thoughts no tonguenor any unproportioned thought his actbe thou familiar but by no means vulgarthe friends thou hast and their adoption triedgrapple them to thy soul with hoops of steelbut do not dull thy palm with entertainmentof each new-hatched unfledged comrade Bewareof entrance to a quarrel but being inbear'tthat th opposed may beware of theegive every man thine ear but few thy voicetake each mans censure but reserve thy judgmentcostly thy habit as thy purse can buybut not expressed in fancy rich not gaudyfor the apparel oft proclaims the manand they in France of the best rank and stationare most select and generous chief in thatneither a borrower nor a lender befor loan oft loses both itself and friendand borrowing dulls the edge of husbandrythis above all to thine own self be trueand it must follow as the night the daythou canst not then be false to any manfarewell my blessing season this in theemost humbly do I take my leave my lordthe time invites you go your servants tendfarewell Ophelia and remember wellwhat I have said to youitis in my memory lockedand you yourself shall keep the key of itfarewellwhat is it Ophelia he hath said to youso please you something touching the lord Hamletmarry well bethoughtitis told me he hath very oft of lategiven private time to you and you yourselfhave of your audience been most free and bounteousif it be so as so itis put on meand that in way of caution I must tell youyou do not understand yourself so clearlyas it behoves my daughter and your honourwhat is between you give me up the truthhe hath my lord of late made many tendersof his affection to meaffection pooh you speak like a green girlunsifted in such perilous rcumstancedo you believe his tenders as you call themI do not know my lord what I should thinkmarry iull teach you think yourself a babythat you have taen these tenders for true paywhich are not sterling Tender yourself more dearlyor not to crack the wind of the poor phraserunning it thus youll tender me a foolmy lord he hath importuned me with lovein honourable fashionay fashion you may call it go to go toand hath given countenance to his speech my lordwith almost all the holy vows of heavenay springes to catch woodcocks I do knowwhen the blood burns how prodigal the soullends the tongue vows these blazes daughtergiving more light than heat extinct in botheven in their promise as it is a-makingyou must not take for fire From this timebe somewhat scanter of your maiden presenceset your entreatments at a higher ratethan a command to parley for lord Hamletbelieve so much in him that he is youngand with a larger tether may he walkthan may be given you in few Opheliado not believe his vows for they are brokersnot of that dye which their investments showbut mere implorators of unholy suitsbreathing like sanctified and pious bawdsthe better to beguile this is for allI would not in plain terms from this time forthhave you so slander any moments leisureas to give words or talk with the lord Hamletlook to'tI charge you come your waysI shall obey my lordthe air bites shrewdly it is very coldit is a nipping and an eager airwhat hour nowI think it lacks of twelveno it is struckindeed I heard it not then it draws near the seasonwherein the spirit held his wont to walkwhat does this mean my lordthe king doth wake to-night and takes his rousekeeps wassail and the swaggering up-spring reelsand as he drains his draughts of Rhenish downthe kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outthe triumph of his pledgeis it a customay marry is itbut to my mind though I am native hereand to the manner born it is a custommore honoured in the breach than the observancethis heavy-headed revel east and westmakes us traduced and taxed of other nationsthey clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrasesoil our addition and indeed it takesfrom our achievements though performed at heightthe pith and marrow of our attributeso oft it chances in particular menthat for some vious mole of nature in themas in their birth wherein they are not guiltysince nature cannot choose his originby the oergrowth of some complexionoft breaking down the pales and forts of reasonor by some habit that too much oer-leavensthe form of plausive manners that these mencarrying I say the stamp of one defectbeing natures livery or fortunes startheir virtues else be they as pure as graceas infinite as man may undergoshall in the general censure take corruptionfrom that particular fault the dram of ealedoth all the noble substance of a doubtto his own scandallook my lord it comesangels and ministers of grace defend usbe thou a spirit of health or goblin damnedbring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hellbe thy intents wicked or charitablethou comest in such a questionable shapethat I will speak to thee iull call thee Hamletking father royal Dane O answer melet me not burst in ignorance but tellwhy thy canonized bones hearsed in deathhave burst their cerements why the sepulchrewherein we saw thee quietly inurnedhath oped his ponderous and marble jawsto cast thee up again what may this meanthat thou dead corse again in complete steelrevisitest thus the glimpses of the moonmaking night hideous and we fools of natureso horridly to shake our dispositionwith thoughts beyond the reaches of our soulssay why is this wherefore what should we doit beckons you to go away with itas if it some impartment did desireto you alonelook with what courteous actionit waves you to a more removed groundbut do not go with itno by no meansit will not speak then will I follow itdo not my lordwhy what should be the fearI do not set my life at a pins feeand for my soul what can it do to thatbeing a thing immortal as itselfit waves me forth again iull follow itwhat if it tempt you toward the flood my lordor to the dreadful summit of the cliffthat beetles oer his base into the seaand there assume some other horrible formwhich might deprive your sovereignty of reasonand draw you into madness think of itthe very place puts toys of desperationwithout more motive into every brainthat looks so many fathoms to the seaand hears it roar beneathit waves me still go on iull follow theeyou shall not go my lordhold off your handsbe ruled you shall not gomy fate cries outand makes each petty artery in this bodyas hardy as the Nemean lions nervestill am I called unhand me gentlemenby heaven iull make a ghost of him that lets meI say away go on iull follow theehe wares desperate with imaginationlets follow itis not fit thus to obey himhave after to what issue will this comesomething is rotten in the state of Denmarkheaven will direct itnay lets follow himwhither wilt thou lead me speak iull go no furthermark meI willmy hour is almost comewhen I to sulphurous and tormenting flamesmust render up myselfalas poor ghostpity me not but lend thy serious hearingto what I shall unfoldspeak I am bound to hearso art thou to revenge when thou shalt hearwhatI am thy fathers spiritdoomed for a certain term to walk the nightand for the day confined to fast in firestill the foul crimes done in my days of natureare burnt and purged away but that I am forbidto tell the secrets of my prison-houseI could a tale unfold whose lightest wordwould harrow up thy soul freeze thy young bloodmake thy two eyes like stars start from their spheresthy knotted and combined locks to partand each particular hair to stand an endlike quills upon the fretful porpentinebut this eternal blazon must not beto ears of flesh and blood List list O listif thou didst ever thy dear father loveO Godrevenge his foul and most unnatural murdermurdermurder most foul as in the best it isbut this most foul strange and unnaturalhaste me to knowt that I with wings as swiftas meditation or the thoughts of lovemay sweep to my revengeI find thee aptand duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedthat rots itself in ease on lethe wharfwouldst thou not stir in this now Hamlet hearitis given out that sleeping in mine orcharda serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmarkis by a forged process of my deathrankly abused but know thou noble youththe serpent that did sting thy fathers lifenow wears his crownO my prophetic soulmy uncleay that incestuous that adulterate beastwith witchcraft of his wit with traitorous giftsO wicked wit and gifts that have the powerso to seduce won to his shameful lustthe will of my most seeming-virtuous queenO Hamlet what a falling-off was therefrom me whose love was of that dignitythat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage and to declineupon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorto those of minebut virtue as it never will be movedthough lewdness court it in a shape of heavenso lust though to a radiant angel linkedwill sate itself in a celestial bedand prey on garbagebut soft methinks I scent the morning airbrief let me be Sleeping within mine orchardmy custom always in the afternoonupon my secure hour thy uncle stolewith juice of cursed hebona in a vialand in the porches of mine ears did pourthe leperous distilment whose effectholds such an enmity with blood of manthat swift as quicksilver it courses throughthe natural gates and alleys of the bodyand with a sudden vigour it doth possetand curd like eager droppings into milkthe thin and wholesome blood so did it mineand a most instant tetter barked aboutmost lazar-like with vile and loathsome crustall my smooth bodythus was I sleeping by a brothers handof life of crown of queen at once dispatchedcut off even in the blossoms of my sinunhouseled disappointed unaneledno reckoning made but sent to my accountwith all my imperfections on my headO horrible O horrible most horribleif thou hast nature in thee bear it notlet not the royal bed of Denmark bea couch for luxury and damned incestbut howsoever thou pursuest this acttaint not thy mind nor let thy soul contriveagainst thy mother aught leave her to heavenand to those thorns that in her bosom lodgeto prick and sting her fare thee well at oncethe glow-worm shows the matin to be nearand gins to pale his uneffectual fireadieu adieu Hamlet remember meO all you host of heaven O earth what elseand shall I couple hell O fie hold hold my heartand you my sinews grow not instant oldbut bear me stiffly up Remember theeay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seatin this distracted globe Remember theeyea from the table of my memoryiull wipe away all trivial fond recordsall saws of books all forms all pressures pastthat youth and observation copied thereand thy commandment all alone shall livewithin the book and volume of my brainunmixed with baser matter yes by heavenO most pernious womanO villain villain smiling damned villainmy tables meet it is I set it downthat one may smile and smile and be a villainat least im sure it may be so in Denmarkso uncle there you are now to my wordit is Adieu adieu remember meI have sworn tmy lord my lordlord Hamletheaven secure himso be ithillo ho ho

times seeing me never shallwith arms encumbered thus or this head-shakeor by pronounng of some doubtful phraseas well well we know or we could an if we would or if we list to speak or there be an

good Reynaldobefore you visit him to make inquiryof his behaviourmy lord I did intend itmarry well said very well said look you sirinquire me first what Danskers are in Parisand how and who what means and where they keepwhat company at what expense and findingby this encompassment and drift of questionthat they do know my son come you more nearerthan your particular demands will touch ittake you as itwere some distant knowledge of himas thus I know his father and his friendsand in part him do you mark this Reynaldoay very well my lordand in part him but you may say not wellbut ift be he I mean hes very wildaddicted so and so and there put on himwhat forgeries you please marry none so rankas may dishonour him take heed of thatbut sir such wanton wild and usual slipsas are companions noted and most knownto youth and libertyas gaming my lorday or drinking fenng swearing quarrellingdrabbing you may go so farmy lord that would dishonour himfaith no as you may season it in the chargeyou must not put another scandal on himthat he is open to incontinencythats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintlythat they may seem the taints of libertythe flash and outbreak of a fiery minda savageness in unreclaimed bloodof general assaultbut my good lordwherefore should you do thisay my lordI would know thatmarry sir heres my driftand I believe it is a fetch of warrantyou laying these slight sullies on my sonas itwere a thing a little soiled inthe workingmark youyour party in converse him you would soundhaving ever seen in the prenominate crimesthe youth you breathe of guilty be assuredhe closes with you in this consequencegood sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the additionof man and countryvery good my lordand then sir does he this he does what was I about to say by the mass I was about to say something where did I leaveat closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marryhe closes with you thus I know the gentlemanI saw him yesterday or'tother dayor then or then with such or such and as you saythere was a gaming there oertook in s rousethere falling out at tennis or perchanceI saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forthsee you nowyour bait of falsehood takes this carp of truthand thus do we of wisdom and of reachwith windlasses and with assays of biasby indirections find directions outso by my former lecture and adviceshall you my son you have me have you notmy lord I havegod be wityou fare you wellgood my lordobserve his inclination in yourselfI shall my lordand let him ply his musicwell my lordfarewellhow now Ophelia whats the matteralas my lord I have been so affrightedwith what in the name of Godmy lord as I was sewing in my closetlord Hamlet with his doublet all unbracedno hat upon his head his stockings fouledungartered and down-gyved to his anclepale as his shirt his knees knocking each otherand with a look so piteous in purportas if he had been loosed out of hellto speak of horrors he comes before memad for thy lovemy lord I do not knowbut truly I do fear itwhat said hehe took me by the wrist and held me hardthen goes he to the length of all his armand with his other hand thus oer his browhe falls to such perusal of my faceas he would draw it long stayed he soat last a little shaking of mine armand thrice his head thus waving up and downhe raised a sigh so piteous and profoundthat it did seem to shatter all his bulkand end his being that done he lets me goand with his head over his shoulder turnedhe seemed to find his way without his eyesfor out o doors he went without their helpand to the last bended their light on mecome go with me I will go seek the kingthis is the very ecstasy of lovewhose violent property fordoes itselfand leads the will to desperate undertakingsas oft as any passion under heaventhat does afflict our natures I am sorrywhat have you given him any hard words of lateno my good lord but as you did commandI did repel his letters and deniedhis access to methat hath made him madI am sorry that with better heed and judgmentI had not quoted him I feared he did but trifleand meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousyby heaven it is as proper to our ageto cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsas it is common for the younger sortto lack discretion come go we to the kingthis must be known which being kept close might movemore grief to hide than hate to utter lovecomewelcome dear Rosencrantz and guildensternmoreover that we much did long to see youthe need we have to use you did provokeour hasty sending Something have you heardof Hamlets transformation so I call itsince nor the exterior nor the inward manresembles that it was what it should bemore than his fathers death that thus hath put himso much from the understanding of himselfI cannot dream of I entreat you boththat being of so young days brought up with himand since so neighboured to his youth and humourthat you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtsome little time so by your companiesto draw him on to pleasures and to gatherso much as from occasion you may gleanwher aught to us unknown afflicts him thusthat opened lies within our remedygood gentlemen he hath much talked of youand sure I am two men there are not livingto whom he more adheres if it will please youto show us so much gentry and good willas to expend your time with us awhilefor the supply and profit of our hopeyour visitation shall receive such thanksas fits a kings remembranceboth your majestiesmight by the sovereign power you have of usput your dread pleasures more into commandthan to entreatybut we both obeyand here give up ourselves in the full bentto lay our service freely at your feetto be commandedthanks Rosencrantz and gentle guildensternthanks guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantzand I beseech you instantly to visitmy too much changed son go some of youand bring these gentlemen where Hamlet isheavens make our presence and our practicespleasant and helpful to himay amenthe ambassadors from norway my good lordare joyfully returnedthou still hast been the father of good newshave I my lord Assure you my good liegeI hold my duty as I hold my soulboth to my God and to my gracious kingand I do think or else this brain of minehunts not the trail of policy so sureas it hath used to do that I have foundthe very cause of Hamlets lunacyO speak of that that do I long to heargive first admittance to the ambassadorsmy news shall be the fruit to that great feastthyself do grace to them and bring them inhe tells me my sweet queen that he hath foundthe head and source of all your sons distemperI doubt it is no-other but the mainhis fathers death and our oerhasty marriagewell we shall sift himwelcome my good friendssay Voltimand what from our brother norwaymost fair return of greetings and desiresupon our first he sent out to suppresshis nephews levies which to him appearedto be a preparation gainst the Polackbut better looked into he truly foundit was against your highness whereat grievedthat so his sickness age and impotencewas falsely borne in hand sends out arrestson fortinbras which he in brief obeysreceives rebuke from norway and in finemakes vow before his uncle never moreto give the assay of arms against your majestywhereon old norway overcome with joygives him three thousand crowns in annual feeand his commission to employ those soldiersso levied as before against the Polackwith an entreaty herein further shownthat it might please you to give quiet passthrough your dominions for this enterpriseon such regards of safety and allowanceas therein are set downit likes us welland at our more considered time well readanswer and think upon this businessmeantime we thank you for your well-took labourgo to your rest at night well feast togethermost welcome homethis business is well endedmy liege and madam to expostulatewhat majesty should be what duty iswhy day is day night night and time is timewere nothing but to waste night day and timetherefore since brevity is the soul of witand tediousness the limbs and outward flourishesI will be brief your noble son is madmad call I it for to define true madnesswhat is it but to be nothing else but madbut let that gomore matter with less artmadam I swear I use no art at allthat he is mad itis true itis true itis pityand pity itis itis true a foolish figurebut farewell it for I will use no artmad let us grant him then and now remainsthat we find out the cause of this effector rather say the cause of this defectfor this effect defective comes by causethus it remains and the remainder thusperpendI have a daughter have while she is minewho in her duty and obedience markhath given me this now gather and surmise"to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified Ophelia "thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautifiedis a vile phrase but you shall hear Thusin her excellent white bosom these &ccame this from Hamlet to hergood madam stay awhile I will be faithful"doubt thou the stars are firedoubt that the sun doth movedoubt truth to be a liarbut never doubt I loveO dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans but that I love thee best O most best believe it Adieuthine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him Hamlet "this in obedience hath my daughter shown meand more above hath his solitingsas they fell out by time by means and placeall given to mine earbut how hath shereceived his lovewhat do you think of meas of a man faithful and honourableI would fain prove so but what might you thinkwhen I had seen this hot love on the wingas I perceived it I must tell you thatbefore my daughter told me what might youor my dear majesty your queen here thinkif I had played the desk or table-bookor given my heart a winking mute and dumbor looked upon this love with idle sightwhat might you think no I went round to workand my young mistress thus I did bespeaklord Hamlet is a prince out of thy starthis must not be and then I precepts gave herthat she should lock herself from his resortadmit no messengers receive no tokenswhich done she took the fruits of my adviceand he repulsed a short tale to makefell into a sadness then into a fastthence to a watch thence into a weaknessthence to a lightness and by this declensioninto the madness wherein now he ravesand all we wail fordo you think itis thisit may be very likelyhath there been such a time id fain know thatthat I have positively said itis so when it proved otherwisenot that I knowtake this from this if this be otherwiseif rcumstances lead me I will findwhere truth is hid though it were hid indeedwithin the centrehow may we try it furtheryou know sometimes he walks four hours togetherhere in the lobbyso he does indeedat such a time iull loose my daughter to himbe you and I behind an arras thenmark the encounter if he love her notand be not from his reason fallen thereonlet me be no assistant for a statebut keep a farm and carterswe will try itbut look where sadly the poor wretch comes readingaway I do beseech you both awayiull board him presentlyO give me leavehow does my good lord Hamletwell God a-mercydo you know me my lordexcellent well you are a fishmongernot I my lordthen I would you were so honest a manhonest my lorday sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousandthats very true my lordfor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughterI have my lordlet her not walk inthe sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to thow say you by that Still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this iull speak to him again what do you read my lordwords words wordswhat is the matter my lordbetween whoI mean the matter that you read my lordslanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backwardthough this be madness yet there is method init Will you walk out of the air my lordinto my graveindeed that is out ofthe airhow pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord I will most humbly take my leave of youyou cannot sir take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my lifefare you well my lordthese tedious old foolsyou go to seek the lord Hamlet there he isgod save you sirmine honoured lordmy most dear lordmy excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye bothas the indifferent children of the earthhappy in that we are not over happy on fortunes cap we are not the very buttonnor the soles of her shoeneither my lordthen you live about her waist or in the middle of her favoursfaith her privates wein the secret parts of fortune O most true she is a strumpet what newsnone my lord but that the worlds grown honestthen is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hitherprison my lorddenmarks a prisonthen is the world onea goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one ofthe worstwe think not so my lordwhy then itis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prisonwhy then your ambition makes it one itis too narrow for your mindO God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreamswhich dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dreama dream itself is but a shadowtruly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadowthen are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows Shall we to the court for by my fay I cannot reasonwell wait upon youwell wait upon youno such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinoreto visit you my lord no other occasionbeggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speakwhat should we say my lordwhy anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour I know the good king and queen have sent for youto what end my lordthat you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever-preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or nowhat say younay then I have an eye of you if you love me hold not offmy lord we were sent forI will tell you why so shall my antipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exerses and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say somy lord there was no such stuff in my thoughtswhy did you laugh then when I said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you servicehe that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle ofthe sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt forit what players are theyeven those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the tyhow chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both waysI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovationdo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the ty are they so followedno indeed they are nothow comes it do they grow rustynay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped forit these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thitherwhat are they children who maintains em how are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own successionfaith there has been much to-do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the questionis it possibleO there has been much throwing about of brainsdo the boys carry it awayay that they do my lord Hercules and his load tooit is not very strange for my uncle is king of Denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it outthere are the playersgentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceivedin what my dear lordI am but mad north-north-west when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsawwell be with you gentlemenhark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-cloutshappily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a childI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir o Monday morning itwas so indeedmy lord I have news to tell youmy lord I have news to tell you when Rosus was an actor in Romethe actors are come hither my lordbuzz buzzupon my honourthen came each actor on his assthe best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral-comical historical-pastoral tragical-historical tragical-comical-historical-pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only menO Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thouwhat a treasure had he my lordwhyone fair daughter and no morethe which he loved passing wellstill on my daughteram I not inthe right old Jephthahif you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing wellnay that follows notwhat follows then my lordwhyas by lot God wotand then you knowit came to pass as most like it wasthe first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comesyou are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well welcome good friends O my old friend thy face is valanced since I saw thee last comest thou to beard me in Denmark what my young lady and mistress by r lady your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome well een toit like French falconers fly at anything we see well have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speechwhat speech my good lordI heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million itwas caviare to the general but it was as I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it I chiefly loved itwasneas tale to Dido and thereabout of it espeally where he speaks of Priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me seetherugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beastitis not so it begins with Pyrrhusthe rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable armblack as his purpose did the night resemblewhen he lay couched in the ominous horsehath now this dread and black complexion smearedwith heraldry more dismal head to footnow is he total gules horridly trickedwith blood of fathers mothers daughters sonsbaked and impasted with the parching streetsthat lend a tyrannous and damned lightto their vile murders rousted in wrath and fireand thus oer-sized with coagulate gorewith eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhusold grandsire Priam seeksso proceed youfore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretionanon he finds himstriking too short at Greeks his antique swordrebellious to his arm lies where it fallsrepugnant to command unequal matchedpyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes widebut with the whiff and wind of his fell swordthe unnerved father falls then senseless Iliumseeming to feel this blow with flaming topstoops to his base and with a hideous crashtakes prisoner Pyrrhus ear for lo his swordwhich was declining on the milky headof rever end Priam seemed inthe air to stickso as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stoodand like a neutral to his will and matterdid nothingbut as we often see against some storma silence in the heavens the rack stand stillthe bold winds speechless and the orb belowas hush as death anon the dreadful thunderdoth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pausearoused vengeance sets him new a-workand never did the Cyclops hammers fallon Marss armour forged for proof eternewith less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding swordnow falls on Priamout out thou strumpet fortune All you godsin general synod take away her powerbreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheeland bowl the round nave down the hill of heavenas low as to the fiendsthis is too longit shall to the barbers with your beard Prithee say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecubabut who O who had seen the mobled queenthe mobled queen thats good mobled queen is goodrun barefoot up and down threatning the flameswith bisson rheum a clout upon that headwhere late the diadem stood and for a robeabout her lank and all oer-teemed loinsa blanket in the alarm of fear caught upwho this had seen with tongue in venom steepedgainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncedbut if the gods themselves did see her thenwhen she saw Pyrrhus make malious sportin minng with his sword her husbands limbsthe instant burst of clamour that she madeunless things mortal move them not at allwould have made milch the burning eyes of heavenand passion in the godslook wher he has not turned his colour and has tears ins eyes Prithee no moreitis well iull have thee speak out the rest soon Good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you livemy lord I will use them according to their desertgods bodikins man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them income sirsfollow him friends well hear a play to-morrowdost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of Gonzagoay my lordwell hat to-morrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert init could you notay my lordvery well follow that lord and look you mock him notmy good friends iull leave you till night you are welcome to Elsinoregood my lorday so God be witye now I am aloneO what a rogue and peasant slave am Iis it not monstrous that this player herebut in a fiction in a dream of passioncould force his soul so to his own conceitthat from her working all his visage wannedtears in his eyes distraction in s aspecta broken voice and his whole function suitingwith forms to his conceit and all for nothingfor Hecubawhat s Hecuba to him or he to Hecubathat he should weep for her what would he dohad he the motive and the cue for passionthat I have he would drown the stage with tearsand cleave the general ear with horrid speechmake mad the guilty and appal the freeconfound the ignorant and amaze indeedthe very faculties of eyes and earsyet Ia dull and muddy-mettled rascal peaklike John-a-dreams unpregnant of my causeand can say nothing no not for a kingupon whose property and most dear lifea damned defeat was made Am I a cowardwho calls me villain breaks my pate acrossplucks off my beard and blows it in my facetweaks me by the nose gives me the lie inthe throatas deep as to the lungs who does me thishaswounds I should take it for it cannot bebut I am pigeon-livered and lack gallto make oppression bitter or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kiteswith this slaves offal Bloody bawdy villainremorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villainO vengeancewhy what an ass am I this is most bravethat I the son of a dear father murderedprompted to my revenge by heaven and hellmust like a whore unpack my heart with wordsand fall a-cursing like a very draba scullionfie uponit foh About my brain I have heardthat guilty creatures sitting at a playhave by the very cunning of the scenebeen struck so to the soul that presentlythey have proclaimed their malefactionsfor murder though it have no tongue will speakwith most miraculous organ iull have these playersplay something like the murder of my fatherbefore mine uncle iull observe his looksiull tent him to the quick if he but blenchI know my course the spirit that I have seenmay be the devil and the devil hath powerto assume a pleasing shape yea and perhapsout of my weakness and my melancholyas he is very potent with such spiritsabuses me to damn me iull have groundsmore relative than this the play s the thingwherein iull catch the consence of the kingand can you by no drift of rcumstanceget from him why he puts on this confusiongrating so harshly all his days of quietwith turbulent and dangerous lunacyhe does confess he feels himself distractedbut from what cause he will by no means speaknor do we find him forward to be soundedbut with a crafty madness keeps aloofwhen we would bring him on to some confessionof his true statedid he receive you wellmost like a gentlemanbut with much forng of his dispositionniggard of question but of our demandsmost free in his replydid you assay himto any pastimemadam it so fell out that certain playerswe oer-raught on the way of these we told himand there did seem in him a kind of joyto hear of it they are about the courtand as I think they have already orderthis night to play before himitis most trueand he beseeched me to entreat your majestiesto hear and see the matterwith all my heart and it doth much content meto hear him so inclinedgood gentlemen give him a further edgeand drive his purpose on to these delightswe shall my lordsweet Gertrude leave us toofor we have closely sent for Hamlet hitherthat he as itwere by acdent may hereaffront Opheliaher father and myself lawful espialswill so bestow ourselves that seeing unseenwe may of their encounter frankly judgeand gather by him as he is behavedif'tbe the affliction of his love or nothat thus he suffers forI shall obey youand for your part Ophelia I do wishthat your good beauties be the happy causeof Hamlets wildness so shall I hope your virtueswill bring him to his wonted way againto both your honoursmadam I wish it mayophelia walk you here gracious so please youwe will bestow ourselvesread on this bookthat show of such an exerse may colouryour loneliness we are oft to blame in thisitis too much proved that with devotions visageand pious action we do sugar oerthe devil himselfO itis too truehow smart a lash that speech doth give my consencethe harlots cheek beautied with plastering artis not more ugly to the thing that helps itthan is my deed to my most painted wordO heavy burdenI hear him coming lets withdraw my lordto be or not to be that is the questionwhether itis nobler in the mind to sufferthe slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneor to take arms against a sea of troublesand by opposing end them to die to sleepno more and by a sleep to say we endthe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksthat flesh is heir to itis a consummationdevoutly to be wished to die to sleepto sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rubfor in that sleep of death what dreams may comewhen we have shuffled off this mortal coilmust give us pause theres the respectthat makes calamity of so long lifefor who would bear the whips and scorns of timethe oppressors wrong the proud mans contumelythe pangs of disprized love the laws delaythe insolence of office and the spurnsthat patient merit of the unworthy takeswhen he himself might his quietus makewith a bare bodkin who would fardels bearto grunt and sweat under a weary lifebut that the dread of something after deaththe undiscovered country from whose bournno traveller returns puzzles the willand makes us rather bear those ills we havethan fly to others that we know not ofthus consence does make cowards of us alland thus the native hue of resolutionis sicklied oer with the pale cast of thoughtand enterprises of great pith and momentwith this regard their currents turn awryand lose the name of action Soft you nowthe fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisonsbe all my sins rememberedgood my lordhow does your honour for this many a dayI humbly thank you well well wellmy lord I have remembrances of yoursthat I have longed long to re-deliverI pray you now receive themno not II never gave you aughtmy honoured lord you know right well you didand with them words of so sweet breath composedas made the things more rich their perfume losttake these again for to the noble mindrich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkindthere my lordha ha are you honestmy lordare you fairwhat means your lordshipthat if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beautycould beauty my lord have better commerce than with honestyay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof I did love thee onceindeed my lord you made me believe soyou should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you notI was the more deceivedget thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your fatherat home my lordlet the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but ins own house farewellO help him you sweet heavensif thou dost marry iull give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewellO heavenly powers restore himI have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname Gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to iull no more onit it hath made me mad I say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery goO what a noble mind is here oerthrownthe courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue swordthe expectancy and rose of the fair statethe glass of fashion and the mould of formthe observed of all observers quite quite downand I of ladies most deject and wretchedthat sucked the honey of his music vowsnow see that noble and most sovereign reasonlike sweet bells jangled out of tune and harshthat unmatched form and feature of blown youthblasted with ecstasy O woe is meto have seen what I have seen see what I seelove his affections do not that way tendnor what he spake though it lacked form a littlewas not like madness theres something in his souloer which his melancholy sits on broodand I do doubt the hatch and the disclosewill be some danger which for to preventI have in quick determinationthus set it down he shall with speed to Englandfor the demand of our neglected tributehaply the seas and countries differentwith variable objects shall expelthis something-settled matter in his heartwhereon his brains still beating puts him thusfrom fashion of himself what think you onitit shall do well but yet do I believethe origin and commencement of his griefsprung from neglected love how now Opheliayou need not tell us what lord Hamlet saidwe heard it all my lord do as you pleasebut if you hold it fit after the playlet his queen mother all alone entreat himto show his griefs let her be round with himand iull be placed so please you in the earof all their conference if she find him notto England send him or confine him whereyour wisdom best shall thinkit shall be somadness in great ones must not unwatched gospeak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rage to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipped for oer-doing Termagant it out-herods Herod pray you avoid itI warrant your honourbe not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this speal observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as itwere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judious grieve the censure of which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominablyI hope we have reformed that indifferently with usO reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you readyhow now my lord will the king hear this piece of workand the queen too and that presentlybid the players make hastewill you two help to hasten themwe will my lordwe will my lordwhat ho Horatiohere sweet lord at your servicehoratio thou art een as just a manas eer my conversation coped withalO my dear lordnay do not think I flatterfor what advancement may I hope from theethat no revenue hast but thy good spiritsto feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flatteredno let the candied tongue lick absurd pompand crook the pregnant hinges of the kneewhere thrift may follow fawning dost thou hearsince my dear soul was mistress of her choiceand could of men distinguish her electionhath sealed thee for herself for thou hast beenas one in suffering all that suffers nothinga man that fortunes buffets and rewardshast taen with equal thanks and blessed are thosewhose blood and judgment are so well comingledthat they are not a pipe for fortunes fingerto sound what stop she please give me that manthat is not passions slave and I will wear himin my hearts core ay in my heart of heartas I do thee Something too much of thisthere is a play to-night before the kingone scene of it comes near the rcumstancewhich I have told thee of my fathers deathI prithee when thou seest that act afooteven with the very comment of thy soulobserve mine uncle if his occulted guiltdo not itself unkennel in one speechit is a damned ghost that we have seenand my imaginations are as foulas Vulcans stithy give him heedful notefor I mine eyes will rivet to his faceand after we will both our judgments joinin censure of his seemingwell my lordif he steal aught the whilst this play is playingand scape detecting I will pay the theftthey are coming to the play I must be idleget you a placehow fares our cousin Hamletexcellent infaith of the chameleons dish I eat the air promise-crammed you cannot feed capons soI have nothing with this answer Hamlet these words are not mineno nor mine nowmy lord you played once inthe university you saythat did I my lord and was accounted a good actorand what did you enactI did enact Julius Ceasar I was killed inthe capitol Brutus killed meit was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the playcrs readyay my lord they stay upon your patiencecome hither my good Hamlet sit by meno good mother heres metal more attractiveO ho do you mark thatlady shall I lie in your lapno my lordI mean my head upon your lapay my lorddo you think I meant country mattersI think nothing my lordthats a fair thought to lie between maids legswhat is my lordnothingyou are merry my lordwho Iay my lordO God your only jig-maker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died withins two hoursnay itis twice two months my lordso long nay then let the devil wear black for iull have a suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then theres hope a great mans memory may outlive his life half a year but byr lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby-horse whose epitaph is for O for O the hobby-horse is forgot what means this my lordmarry this is miching mallecho it means mischiefbelike this show imports the argument of the playwe shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel theyll tell allwill he tell us what this show meantay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamed to show hell not shame to tell you what it meansyou are naught you are naught iull mark the playfor us and for our tragedyhere stooping to your clemencywe beg your hearing patientlyis this a prologue or the posy of a ringitis brief my lordas womans lovefull thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone roundneptunes salt wash and Tellus orbed groundand thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheenabout the world have times twelve thirties beensince love our hearts and Hymen did our handsunite commutual in most sacred bandsso many journeys may the sun and moonmake us again count oer ere love be donebut woe is me you are so sick of lateso far from cheer and from your former statethat I distrust you yet though I distrustdiscomfort you my lord it nothing mustfor womens fear and love holds quantityin neither aught or in extremitynow what my love is proof hath made you knowand as my love is sized my fear is sowhere love is great the littlest doubts are fearwhere little fears grow great great love grows therefaith I must leave thee love and shortly toomy operant powers their functions leave to doand thou shall live in this fair world behindhonoured beloved and haply one as kindfor husband shalt thouO confound the restsuch love must needs be treason in my breastin second husband let me be accurstnone wed the second but who killed the firstwormwood wormwoodthe instances that second marriage moveare base respects of thrift but none of lovea second time I kill my husband deadwhen second husband kisses me in bedI do believe you think what now you speakbut what we do determine oft we breakpurpose is but the slave to memoryof violent birth but poor validitywhich now like fruit unripe sticks on the treebut fall unshaken when they mellow bemost necessary itis that we forgetto pay ourselves what to ourselves is debtwhat to ourselves in passion we proposethe passion ending doth the purpose losethe violence of either grief or joytheir own enactures with themselves destroywhere joy most revels grief doth most lamentgrief joys joy grieves on slender acdentthis world is not for aye nor itis not strangethat even our love should with our fortunes changefor itis a question left us yet to provewher love lead fortune or else fortune lovethe great man down you mark his favourite fliesthe poor advanced makes friends of enemiesand hitherto doth love on fortune tendfor who not needs shall never lack a friendand who in want a hollow friend doth trydirectly seasons him his enemybut orderly to end where I begunour wills and fates do so contrary runthat our devices still are overthrownour thoughts are ours their ends none of our ownso think thou wilt no second husband wedbut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is deadnor earth to me give food nor heaven lightsport and repose lock from me day and nightto desperation turn my trust and hopean anchors cheer in prison be my scopeeach opposite that blanks the face of joymeet what I would have well and it destroyboth here and hence pursue me lasting strifeif once a widow ever I be wifeif she should break it nowitis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhilemy spirits grow dull and fain I would beguilethe tedious day with sleepsleep rock thy brainand never come mischance between us twainmadam how like you this playthe lady doth protest too much methinksO but shell keep her wordhave you heard the argument is there no offence initno no they do but jest poison in jest no offence inthe worldwhat do you call the playthe Mouse-trap Marry how Tropically this play is the image of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is the dukes name his wife Baptista you shall see anon itis a knavish piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince our withers are unwrungthis is one Luanus nephew to the kingyou are a good chorus my lordI could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallyingyou are keen my lord you are keenit would cost you a groaning to take off my edgestill better and worseso you must take your husbands Begin murderer pox leave thy damnable faces and begin come the croaking raven doth bellow for revengethoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeingconfederate season else no creature seeingthou mixture rank of midnight weeds collectedwith Hecates ban thrice blasted thrice infectedthy natural magic and dire propertyon wholesome life usurp immediatelyhe poisons him inthe garden fors estate hisnames Gonzago the story is extant and writ in very choice Italian you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzagos wifethe king riseswhat frighted with false firehow fares my lordgive oer the playgive me some light awaylights lights lightswhy let the stricken deer go weepthe hart ungalled playfor some must watch while some must sleepso runs the world awaywould not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provinal roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sirhalf a sharea whole one Ifor thou dost know O Damon dearthis realm dismantled wasof Jove himself and now reigns herea very very pajockyou might have rimedO good Horatio iull take the ghosts word for a thousand pound didst perceivevery well my lordupon the talk of the poisoningI did very well note himah ha come some music come the recordersfor if the king like not the comedywhy then belike he likes it not perdycome some musicgood my lord vouchsafe me a word with yousir a whole historythe king siray sir what of himis in his retirement marvellous distemperedwith drink sirno my lord rather with choleryour wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor for for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more cholergood my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affairI am tame sir pronouncethe queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to youyou are welcomenay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do your mothers commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my businesssir I cannotwhat my lordmake you a wholesome answer my wits diseased but sir such answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother therefore no more but to the matter my mother you saythen thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into amasement and admirationO wonderful son that can so astonish a mother but is there no sequel at the heels of this mothers admiration Impartshe desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bedwe shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with usmy lord you once did love meso I do still by these pickers and stealersgood my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friendsir I lack advancementhow can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmarkay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something mustyO the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toilO my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerlyI do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipemy lord I cannotI pray youbelieve me I cannotI do beseech youI know no touch of it my lorditis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stopsbut these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony I have not the skillwhy look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak Sblood do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon megod bless you sirmy lord the queen would speak with you and presentlydo you see yonder cloud thats almost in shape of a camelby the mass and itis like a camel indeedmethinks it is like a weaselit is backed like a weaselor like a whalevery like a whalethen I will come to my mother by and bythey fool me to the top of my bent [aloud ] I will come by and byI will say soby and by is easily said Leave me friendsitis now the very witching time of nightwhen churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes outcontagion to this world now could I drink hot bloodand do such bitter business as the daywould quake to look on Soft now to my motherO heart lose not thy nature let not everthe soul of Nero enter this firm bosomlet me be cruel not unnaturalI will speak daggers to her but use nonemy tongue and soul in this be hypocriteshow in my words soever she be shentto give them seals never my soul consentI like him not nor stands it safe with usto let his madness range therefore prepare youI your commission will forth with dispatchand he to England shall along with youthe terms of our estate may not endurehazard so dangerous as doth hourly growout of his lunaeswe will ourselves providemost holy and religious fear it isto keep those many many bodies safethat live and feed upon your majestythe single and peculiar life is boundwith all the strength and armour of the mindto keep itself from noyance but much morethat spirit upon whose weal depend and restthe lives of many the cease of majestydies not alone but like a gulf doth drawwhats near it with it it is a massy wheelfixed on the summit of the highest mountto whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsare mortised and adjoined which when it fallseach small annexment petty consequenceattends the boisterous ruin never alonedid the king sigh but with a general groanarm you I pray you to this speedy voyagefor we will fetters put upon this fearwhich now goes too free-footedwe will haste uswe will haste usmy lord hes going to his mothers closetbehind the arras iull convey myselfto hear the process iull warrant shell tax him homeand as you said and wisely was it saiditis meet that some more audience than a mothersince nature makes them partial should oerhearthe speech of vantage fare you well my liegeiull call upon you ere you go to bedand tell you what I knowthanks dear my lordO my offence is rank it smells to heavenit hath the primal eldest curse uponita brothers murder pray can I notthough inclination be as sharp as willmy stronger guilt defeats my strong intentand like a man to double business boundI stand in pause where I shall first beginand both neglect what if this cursed handwere thicker than itself with brothers bloodis there not rain enough in the sweet heavensto wash it white as snow whereto serves mercybut to confront the visage of offenceand whats in prayer but this two-fold forceto be forestalled ere we come to fallor pardoned being down then iull look upmy fault is past but O what form of prayercan serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since I am still possessedof those effects for which I did the murdermy crown mine own ambition and my queenmay one be pardoned and retain the offencein the corrupted currents of this worldoffences gilded hand may shove by justiceand oft itis seen the wicked prise itselfbuys out the law but itis not so abovethere is no shuffling there the action liesin his true nature and we ourselves compelledeven to the teeth and forehead of our faultsto give in evidence what then what reststry what repentance can what can it notyet what can it when one can not repentO wretched state O bosom black as deathO limed soul that struggling to be freeart more engaged help angels make assaybow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steelbe soft as sinews of the new-born babeall may be wellnow might I do it pat now he is prayingand now iull doit and so he goes to heavenand so am I revenged that would be scanneda villain kills my father and for thatI his sole son do this same villain sendto heavenwhy this is hire and salary not revengehe took my father grossly full of breadwith all his crimes broad blown as flush as Mayand how his audit stands who knows save heavenbut in our rcumstance and course of thoughtitis heavy with him and am I then revengedto take him in the purging of his soulwhen he is fit and seasoned for his passagenoup sword and know thou a more horrid hentwhen he is drunk asleep or in his rageor in the incestuous pleasure of his bedat gaming swearing or about some actthat has no relish of salvation initthen trip him that his heels may kick at heavenand that his soul may be as damned and blackas hell whereto it goes my mother staysthis physic but prolongs thy sickly daysmy words fly up my thoughts remain belowwords without thoughts never to heaven gohe will come straight look you lay home to himtell him his pranks have been too broad to bear withand that your grace hath screened and stood betweenmuch heat and him iull silence me een herepray you be round with himmother mother motheriull warrant youfear me not Withdraw I hear him comingnow mother whats the matterhamlet thou hast thy father much offendedmother you have my father much offendedcome come you answer with an idle tonguego go you question with a wicked tonguewhy how now Hamletwhats the matter nowhave you forgot meno by the rood not soyou are the queen your husbands brothers wifeand would it were not so you are my mothernay then iull set those to you that can speakcome come and sit you down you shall not budgeyou go not till I set you up a glasswhere you may see the inmost part of youwhat wilt thou do thou wilt not murder mehelp help howhat ho help help helphow now a rat dead for a ducat deadO I am slainO me what hast thou donenay I know not is it the kingO what a rash and bloody deed is thisa bloody deed almost as bad good motheras kill a king and marry with his brotheras kill a kingay lady itwas my wordthou wretched rash intruding fool farewellI took thee for thy better take thy fortunethou findest to be too busy is some dangerleave wringing of your hands peace sit you downand let me wring your heart for so I shallif it be made of penetrable stuffif damned custom have not brassed it sothat it is proof and bulwark against sensewhat have I done that thou darest wag thy tonguein noise so rude against mesuch an actthat blurs the grace and blush of modestycalls virtue hypocrite takes off the rosefrom the fair forehead of an innocent loveand sets a blister there makes marriage vowsas false as dicers oaths O such a deedas from the body of contraction plucksthe very soul and sweet religion makesa rhapsody of words heavens face doth glowyea this solidity and compound masswith tristful visage as against the doomis thought-sick at the actay me what actthat roars so loud and thunders in the indexlook here upon this picture and on thisthe counterfeit presentment of two brotherssee what a grace was seated on this browhyperions curls the front of Jove himselfan eye like Mars to threaten and commanda station like the herald Mercurynew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hilla combination and a form indeedwhere every god did seem to set his sealto give the world assurance of a manthis was your husband look you now what followshere is your husband like a mildewed earblasting his wholesome brother have you eyescould you on this fair mountain leave to feedand batten on this moor Ha have you eyesyou cannot call it love for at your agethe hey-day in the blood is tame its humbleand waits upon the judgment and what judgmentwould step from this to this Sense sure you haveelse could you not have motion but sure that senseis apoplexed for madness would not errnor sense to ecstasy was neer so thralledbut it reserved some quantity of choiceto serve in such a difference what devil was tthat thus hath comened you at hoodman-blindeyes without feeling feeling without sightears without hands or eyes smelling sans allor but a sickly part of one true sensecould not so mopeO shame where is thy blush Rebellious hellif thou canst mutine in a matrons bonesto flaming youth let virtue be as waxand melt in her own fire proclaim no shamewhen the compulsive ardour gives the chargesince first itself as actively doth burnand reason panders willO Hamlet speak no morethou turnest mine eyes into my very souland there I see such black and grained spotsas will not leave their tinctnay but to livein the rank sweat of an enseamed bedstewed in corruption honeying and making loveover the nasty styO speak to me no morethese words like daggers enter in mine earsno more sweet Hamleta murderer and a villaina slave that is not twentieth part the titheof your precedent lord a vice of kingsa cut-purse of the empire and the rulethat from a shelf the precious diadem stoleand put it in his pocketno morea king of shreds and patchessave me and hover oer me with your wingsyou heavenly guards what would your gracious figurealas hes maddo you not come your tardy son to chidethat lapsed in time and passion lets go bythe important acting of your dread commandO saydo not forget this visitationis but to whet thy almost blunted purposebut look amazement on thy mother sitsO step between her and her fighting soulconceit in weakest bodies strongest worksspeak to her Hamlethow is it with you ladyalas how isit with youthat you do bend your eye on vacancyand with the incorporal air do hold discourseforth at your eyes your spirits wildly peepand as the sleeping soldiers in the alarmyour bedded hair like life in excrementsstarts up and stands an end O gentle sonupon the heat and flame of thy distempersprinkle cool patience whereon do you lookon him on him look you how pale he glareshis form and cause conjoined preaching to stoneswould make them capable do not look upon melest with this piteous action you convertmy stern effects then what I have to dowill want true colour tears perchance for bloodto whom do you speak thisdo you see nothing therenothing at all yet all that is I seenor did you nothing hearno nothing but ourselveswhy look you there look how it steals awaymy father in his habit as he livedlook where he goes even now out at the portalthis is the very coinage of your brainthis bodiless creation ecstasyis very cunning inecstasymy pulse as yours doth temperately keep timeand makes as healthful music it is not madnessthat I have uttered bring me to the testand I the matter will re-word which madnesswould gambol from Mother for love of gracelay not that flattering unction to your soulthat not your trespass but my madness speaksit will but skin and film the ulcerous placewhiles rank corruption mining all withininfects unseen confess yourself to heavenrepent whats past avoid what is to comeand do not spread the compost on the weedsto make them ranker forgive me this my virtuefor in the fatness of these pursy timesvirtue itself of vice must pardon begyea curb and woo for leave to do him goodO Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twainO throw away the worser part of itand live the purer with the other halfgood night but go not to mine uncles bedassume a virtue if you have it notthat monster custom who all sense doth eatof habits devil is angel yet in thisthat to the use of actions fair and goodhe likewise gives a frock or liverythat aptly is put on Refrain to-nightand that shall lend a kind of easinessto the next abstinence the next more easyfor use almost can change the stamp of natureand master evn the devil or throw him outwith wondrous potency Once more goodnightand when you are desirous to be blessediull blessing beg of you for this same lordI do repent but heaven hath pleased it soto punish me with this and this with methat I must be their scourge and ministerI will bestow him and will answer wellthe death I gave him so again good-nightI must be cruel only to be kindthus bad begins and worse remains behindone word more good ladywhat shall I donot this by no means that I bid you dolet the bloat king tempt you again to bedpinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouseand let him for a pair of reechy kissesor paddling in your neck with his damned fingersmake you to ravel all this matter outthat I essentially am not in madnessbut mad in craft itwere good you let him knowfor who thats but a queen fair sober wisewould from a paddock from a bat a gibsuch dear concernings hide who would do sono in despite of sense and secrecyunpeg the basket on the houses toplet the birds fly and like the famous apeto try conclusions in the basket creepand break your own neck downbe thou assured if words be made of breathand breath of life I have no life to breathewhat thou hast said to meI must to England you know thatalackI had forgot itis so concluded ontheres letters sealed and my two schoolfellowswhom I will trust as I will adders fangedthey bear the mandate they must sweep my wayand marshal me to knavery let it workfor itis the sport to have the enginerhoist with his own petar and it shall go hardbut I will delve one yard below their minesand blow them at the moon O itis most sweetwhen in one line two crafts directly meetthis man shall set me packingiull lug the guts into the neighbour roommother good-night indeed this counselloris now most still most secret and most gravewho was in life a foolish prating knavecome sir to draw toward an end with yougood-night mothertheres matter in these sighs these profound heavesyou must translate itis fit we understand themwhere is your sonbestow this place on us a little whileah my good lord what have I seen to-nightwhat Gertrude how does Hamletmad as the sea and wind when both contendwhich is the mightier in his lawless fitbehind the arras hearing something stirwhips out his rapier cries a rat a rat and in his brainish apprehension killsthe unseen good old manO heavy deedit had been so with us had we been therehis liberty is full of threats to allto you yourself to us to every onealas how shall this bloody deed be answeredit will be laid to us whose providenceshould have kept short restrained and out of hauntthis mad young man but so much was our lovewe would not understand what was most fitbut like the owner of a foul diseaseto keep it from divulging let it feedeven on the pith of life where is he goneto draw apart the body he hath killedoer whom his very madness like some oreamong a mineral of metals baseshows itself pure he weeps for what is doneO Gertrude come awaythe sun no sooner shall the mountains touchbut we will ship him hence and this vile deedwe must with all our majesty and skillboth countenance and excuse Ho guildensternfriends both go join you with some further aidhamlet in madness hath Polonius slainand from his mothers closet hath he dragged himgo seek him out speak fair and bring the bodyinto the chapel I pray you haste in thiscome Gertrude well call up our wisest friendsand let them know both what we mean to doand whats untimely done so haply slanderwhose whisper oer the worlds diameteras level as the cannon to his blanktransports his poisoned shot may miss our nameand hit the woundless air O come awaymy soul is full of discord and dismaysafely stowedhamlet lord Hamlethamlet lord Hamletwhat noise who calls on HamletO here they comewhat have you done my lord with the dead bodycompounded it with dust whereto itis kintell us where itis that we may take it thenceand bear it to the chapeldo not believe itbelieve whatthat I can keep your counsel and not mine own besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a kingtake you me for a sponge my lorday sir that soaks up the kings countenance his rewards his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry againI understand you not my lordI am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish earmy lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the kingthe body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thinga thing my lordof nothing bring me to him hide fox and all afterI have sent to seek him and to find the bodyhow dangerous is it that this man goes looseyet must not we put the strong law on himhes loved of the distracted multitudewho like not in their judgment but their eyesand where itis so the offenders scourge is weighedbut never the offence to bear all smooth and eventhis sudden sending him away must seemdeliberate pause diseases desperate grownby desperate appliance are relievedor not at allhow now what hath befallnwhere the dead body is bestowed my lordwe cannot get from himbut where

fortinbrasgoes it against the main of Poland siror for some frontiertruly to speak and with no additionwe go to gain a little patch of groundthat hath in it no profit but the nameto pay five ducats five I would not farm itnor will it yield to norway or the Polea ranker rate should it be sold in feewhy then the Polack never will defend ityes itis already garrisonedtwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatswill not debate the question of this strawthis is the imposthume of much wealth and peacethat inward breaks and shows no cause withoutwhy the man dies I humbly thank you

market of his timebe but to sleep and feed a beast no moresure he that made us with such large discourselooking before and after gave us notthat capability and god-like reasonto fust in us unused now wher it bebestial oblivion or some craven scrupleof thinking too presely on the eventa thought which quartered hath but one part wisdomand ever three parts coward I do not knowwhy yet I live to say this things to do sith I have cause and will and strength and meansto doit Examples gross as earth exhort mewitness this army of such mass and chargeled by a delicate and tender princewhose spirit with divine ambition puffedmakes mouths at the invisible eventexposing what is mortal and unsureto all that fortune death and danger dareeven for an egg-shell Rightly to be greatis not to stir without great argumentbut greatly to find quarrel in a strawwhen honours at the stake how stand I thenthat have a father killed a mother stainedextements of my reason and my bloodand let all sleep while to my shame I seethe imminent death of twenty thousand menthat for a fantasy and trick of famego to their graves like beds fight for a plotwhereon the numbers cannot try the causewhich is not tomb enough and continentto hide the slaim O from this time forthmy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worthI will not speak with hershe is importunate indeed distracther mood will needs be pitiedwhat would she haveshe speaks much of her father says she hearstheres tricks inthe world and hems and beats her heartspurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubtthat carry but half sense her speech is nothingyet the unshaped use of it doth movethe hearers to collection they aim at itand botch the words up fit to their own thoughtswhich as her winks and nods and gestures yield themindeed would make one think there might be thoughtthough nothing sure yet much unhappilyitwere good she were spoken with for she may strewdangerous conjectures in ill-breeding mindslet her come into my sick soul as sins true nature iseach toy seems prologue to some great amissso full of artless jealousy is guiltit spills itself in fearing to be spiltwhere

I am let to know it ishoratio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very war-like appointment gave us chase finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour in the grapple I boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for them let the king have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter these good fellows will bring thee where I am Rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for England of them I have much to tell thee farewellhe that thou knowest thinecome I will give you way for these your lettersand doit the speedier that you may direct meto him from whom you brought themnow must your consence my acquittance sealand you must put me in your heart for friendsith you have heard and with a knowing earthat he which hath your noble father slainpursued my lifeit well appears but tell mewhy you proceeded not against these featsso crimeful and so capital in natureas by your safety wisdom all things elseyou mainly were stirred upO for two speal reasonswhich may to you perhaps seem much unsinewedbut yet to me they are strong the queen his motherlives almost by his looks and for myselfmy virtue or my plague be it either whichshes so conjunctive to my life and soulthat as the star moves not but in his sphereI could not but by her the other motivewhy to a public count I might not gois the great love the general gender bear himwho dipping all his faults in their affectionwould like the spring that turneth wood to stoneconvert his gyves to graces so that my arrowstoo slightly timbered for so loud a windwould have reverted to my bow againand not where I had aimed themand so have I a noble father losta sister driven into desperate termswhose worth if praises may go back againstood challenger on mount of all the agefor her perfections but my revenge will comebreak not your sleeps for that you must not thinkthat we are made of stuff so flat and dullthat we can let our beard be shook with dangerand think it pastime you shortly shall hear moreI loved your father and we love ourselfand that I hope will teach you to imaginehow now what newsletters my lord from Hamletthis to your majesty this to the queenfrom Hamlet who brought themsailors my lord they say I saw them notthey were given me by Claudio he received themof him that brought themlaertes you shall hear themleave ushigh and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom to-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange returnwhat should this mean are all the rest come backor is it some abuse and no such thingknow you the handitis Hamlets character Naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise meim lost in it my lord but let him comeit warms the very sickness in my heartthat I shall live and tell him to his teeththus diddest thou if it be so Laertesas how should it be so how otherwisewill you be ruled by meay my lordso you will not oer-rule me to a peaceto thine own peace if he be now returnedas checking at his voyage and that he meansno more to undertake it I will work himto an exploit now ripe in my deviceunder the which he shall not choose but falland for his death no wind of blame shall breathebut even his mother shall uncharge the practiceand call it acdentmy lord I will be ruledthe rather if you could devise it sothat I might be the organit falls rightyou have been talked of since your travel muchand that in Hamlets hearing for a qualitywherein they say you shine your sum of partsdid not together pluck such envy from himas did that one and that in my regardof the unworthiest siegewhat part is that my lorda very riband in the cap of youthyet needful too for youth no less becomesthe light and careless livery that it wearsthan settled age his sables and his weedsimporting health and graveness Two months sincehere was a gentleman of normandyive seen myself and served against the Frenchand they can well on horseback but this gallanthad witchcraft init he grew unto his seatand to such wondrous doing brought his horseas he had been incorpsed and demi-naturedwith the brave beast so far he topped my thoughtthat I in forgery of shapes and trickscome short of what he dida norman was ta normanupon my life Lamordthe very sameI know him well he is the brooch indeedand gem of all the nationhe made confession of youand gave you such a masterly reportfor art and exerse in your defenceand for your rapier most espeallythat he cried out twould be a sight indeedif one could match you the scrimers of their nationhe swore had neither motion guard nor eyeif you opposed them sir this report of hisdid Hamlet so envenom with his envythat he could nothing do but wish and begyour sudden coming oer to play with himnow out of thiswhat out of this my lordlaertes was your father dear to youor are you like the painting of a sorrowa face without a heartwhy ask you thisnot that I think you did not love your fatherbut that I know love is begun by timeand that I see in passages of prooftime qualifies the spark and fire of itthere lives within the very flame of lovea kind of wick or snuff that will abate itand nothing is at a like goodness stillfor goodness growing to a plurisydies in his own too-much that we would dowe should do when we would for this would changesand hath abatements and delays as manyas there are tongues are hands are acdentsand then this should is like a spendthrift sighthat hurts by easing but to the quick ofthe ulcerhamlet comes back what would you undertaketo show yourself your fathers son in deedmore than in wordsto cut his throat inthe churchno place indeed should murder sanctuarizerevenge should have no bounds but good Laerteswill you do this keep close within your chamberhamlet returned shall know you are come homewell put on those shall praise your excellenceand set a double varnish on the famethe Frenchman gave you bring you in fine togetherand wager on your heads he being remisemost generous and free from all contrivingwill not peruse the foils so that with easeor with a little shuffling you may choosea sword unbated and in a pass of practicerequite him for your fatherI will doitand for that purpose iull anoint my swordI bought an unction of a mountebankso mortal that but dip a knife in itwhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rarecollected from all simples that have virtueunder the moon can save the thing from deaththat is but scratched withal iull touch my pointwith this contagion that if I gall him slightlyit may be deathlets further think of thisweigh what convenience both of time and meansmay fit us to our shape if this should failand that our drift look through our bad performanceitwere better not assayed therefore this projectshould have a back or second that might holdif this should blast in proof Soft let me seewell make a solemn wager on your cunningsI hatwhen in your motion you are hot and dryas make your bouts more violent to that endand that he calls for drink iull have prepared hima chalice for the nonce whereon but sippingif he by chance escape your venomed stuckour purpose may hold there but stay what noisehow now sweet queenone woe doth tread upon anothers heelso fast they follow your sisters drowned Laertesdrowned O wherethere is a willow grows aslant a brookthat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy streamthere with fantastic garlands did she comeof crow-flowers nettles daisies and long purplesthat liberal shepherds give a grosser namebut our cold maids do dead mens fingers call themthere on the pendent boughs her coronet weedsclambering to hang an envious sliver brokewhen down her weedy trophies and herselffell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wideand mermaid-like awhile they bore her upwhich time she chanted snatches of old tunesas one incapable of her own distressor like a creature native and induedunto that element but long it could not betill that her garments heavy with their drinkpulled the poor wretch from her melodious layto muddy deathalas then she is drowneddrowned drownedtoo much of water hast thou poor Ophelisand therefore I forbid my tears but yetit is our trick nature her custom holdslet shame say what it will when these are gonethe woman will be out Adieu my lordI have a speech of fire that fain would blazebut that this folly douts itlets follow Gertrudehow much I had to do to calm his ragenow fear I this will give it start againtherefore lets followis she to be buried in christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvationI tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burialhow can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defencewhy itis found soit must be se offendendo it cannot be else for here lies the point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches it is to act to do and to perform argal she drowned herself wittinglynay but hear you goodman delvergive me leave here lies the water good here stands the man good if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own lifebut is this laway marry is it crowners quest lawwill you ha the truth onit if this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o christian burialwhy there thou sayest and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian come my spade there is no anent gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and grave-makers they hold up Adams professionwas he a gentlemana was the first that ever bore armswhy he had nonewhat art a heathen how dost thou understand the Scripture the Scripture says Adam digged could be dig without armsiull put another question to thee if thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyselfgo towhat is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenterthe gallows-maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenantsI like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well but how does it well it does well to those that do ill now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal the gallows may do well to theeto'tagain comewho builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenteray tell me that and unyokemarry now I can tellto tmass I cannot tellcudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question next say a grave-maker the houses that he makes last till doomsday go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquorin youth when I did love did lovemethought it was very sweetto contract O the time for-a my behoveO methought there was nothing meethas this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave-makingcustom hath made it in him a property of easinessitis een so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sensebut age with his stealing stepshath clawed me in his clutchand hath shipped me intil the landas if I had never been suchthat skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were Cains jaw-bone that did the first murder this might be the pate of a politian which this ass now oer-offices one that would rcumvent God might it notit might my lordor of a courtier which could say Good morrow sweet lord how dost thou good lord this might be my lord such-a-one that praised my lord such-a-ones horse when he meant to beg it might it notay my lordwhy een so and now my Lady Worms chapless and knocked about the mazzard with a sextons spade heres fine revolution an we had the trick to seeit did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with em mine ache to think onita pick-axe and a spade a spadefor and a shrouding sheetO a pit of clay for to be madefor such a guest is meettheres another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be in s time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyance of his lands will hardly lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more hanot a jot more my lordis not parchment made of sheep-skinsay my lord and of calf-skins toothey are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I will speak to this fellow whose graves this sirmine sirO a pit of clay for to be madefor such a guest is meetI think it be thine indeed for thou liest inityou lie out onit sir and therefore it is not yours for my part I do not lie init and yet it is minethou dost lie init to be init and say it is thine itis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liestitis a quick lie sir itwill away again from me to youwhat man dost thou dig it forfor no man sirwhat woman thenfor none neitherwho is to be buried initone that was a woman sir but rest her soul shes deadhow absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord Horatio these three years I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe how long hast thou been a grave-makerof all the days inthe year I came to'tthat day that our last king Hamlet overcame fortinbrashow long is that sincecannot you tell that every fool can tell that it was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into Englanday marry why was he sent into Englandwhy because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not itis no great matter therewhyitwill not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as hehow came he madvery strangely they sayhow strangelyfaith een with losing his witsupon what groundwhy here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and boy thirty yearshow long will a man lie inthe earth ere he rotfaith if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year a tanner will last you nine yearwhy he more than anotherwhy sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body heres a skull now this skull hath lain you inthe earth three-and-twenty yearswhose was ita whoreson mad fellows it was whose do you think it wasnay I know nota pestilence on him for a mad rogue a poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once this same skull sir was Yoricks skull the kings jesterthiseen thatlet me seealas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rises at it here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell me one thingwhats that my lorddost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion inthe eartheen soand smelt so paheen so my lordto what base uses we may return Horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-holeitwere to consider too curiously to consider sono faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died Alexander was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrelimperious Ceasar dead and turned to claymight stop a hole to keep the wind awayO that that earth which kept the world in aweshould patch a wall to expal the winters flawbut soft but soft aside here comes the kingthe queen the courtiers who is that they followand with such maimed rites this doth betokenthe corse they follow did with desperate handfordo its own life itwas of some estatecouch we awhile and markwhat ceremony elsethat is Laertesa very noble youth markwhat ceremony elseher obsequies have been as far enlargedas we have warrantise her death was doubtfuland but that great command oersways the ordershe should in ground unsanctified have lodgedtill the last trumpet for charitable prayersshards flints and pebbles should be thrown on heryet here she is allowed her virgin crantsher maiden strewments and the bringing homeof bell and burialmust there no more be doneno more be donewe should profane the service of the deadto sing a requiem and such rest to heras to peace-parted soulslay her inthe earthand from her fair and unpolluted fleshmay violets spring I tell thee churlish priesta ministering angel shall my sister bewhen thou liest howlingwhat the fair Opheliasweets to the sweet farewellI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlets wifeI thought thy bride-bed to have decked sweet maidand not have strewed thy graveO treble woefall ten times treble on that cursed headwhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sensedeprived thee of hold off the earth awhiletill I have caught her once more in mine armsnow pile your dust upon the quick and deadtill of this flat a mountain you have madeto oer-top old Pelion or the skyish headof blue Olympuswhat is he whose griefbears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrowconjures the wandering stars and makes them standlike wonder-wounded hearers this is Ihamlet the Danethe devil take thy soulthou prayest not wellI prithee take thy fingers from my throatfor though I am not splenetive and rashyet have I in me something dangerouswhich let thy wisdom fear away thy handpluck them asunderhamlet Hamletgentlemengood my lord be quietwhy I will fight with him upon this themeuntil my eyelids will no longer wagO my son what themeI loved Ophelia forty thousand brotherscould not with all their quantity of lovemake up my sum what wilt thou do for herO he is mad Laertesfor love of God forbear himswounds show me what thoult dowoot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyselfwoot drink up eisel eat a crocodileiull doit dost thou come here to whineto outface me with leaping in her gravebe buried quick with her and so will Iand if thou prate of mountains let them throwmillions of acres on us till our groundsingeing his pate against the burning zonemake Ossa like a wart nay an thoult mouthiull rant as well as thouthis is mere madnessand thus a while the fit will work on himanon as patient as the female dovewhen that her golden couplets are disclosedhis silence will sit droopinghear you sirwhat is the reason that you use me thusI loved you ever but it is no matterlet Hercules himself do what he maythe cat will mew and dog will have his dayI pray you good Horatio wait upon himstrengthen your patience in our last nights speechwell put the matter to the present pushgood Gertrude set some watch over your sonthis grave shall have a living monumentan hour of quiet shortly shall we seetill then in patience our proceeding beso much for this sir now shall you see the otheryou do remember all the rcumstanceremember it my lordsir in my heart there was a kind of fightingthat would not let me sleep methought I layworse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashlyand praised be rashness for it let us knowour indiscretion sometimes serves us wellwhen our deep plots do pall and that should teach ustheres a divinity that shapes our endsrough-hew them how we willthat is most certainup from my cabinmy sea-gown scarfed about me in the darkgroped I to find out them had my desirefingered their packet and in fine withdrewto mine own room again making so boldmy fears forgetting manners to unsealtheir grand commission where I found HoratioO royal knavery an exact commandlarded with many several sorts of reasonsimporting Denmarks health and Englands toowith ho such bugs and goblins in my lifethat on the supervise no leisure batedno not to stay the grinding of the axemy head should be struck offis it possibleheres the commission read it at more leisurebut wilt thou hear me how I did proceedI beseech youbeing thus be-netted round with villaniesere I could make a prologue to my brainsthey had begun the play I sat me downdevised a new commission wrote it fairI once did hold it as our statists doa baseness to write fair and laboured muchhow to forget that learning but sir nowit did me yeomans service wilt thou knowthe effect of what I wroteay good my lordan earnest conjuration from the kingas England was his faithful tributaryas love between them like the palm should flourishas peace should still her wheaten garland wearand stand a comma btween their amitiesand many such-like Ases of great chargethat on the view and knowing of these contentswithout debatement further more or lesshe should the bearers put to sudden deathnot shriving-time allowedhow was this sealedwhy even in that was heaven ordinantI had my fathers signet in my pursewhich was the model of that Danish sealfolded the writ up in form of the othersubscribed it gavet th impression placed it safelythe changeling never known now the next daywas our sea-fight and what to this was sequentthou knowest alreadyso guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to twhy man they did make love to this employmentthey are not near my consence their defeatdoes by their own insinuation growitis dangerous when the baser nature comesbetween the pass and fell-incensed pointsof mighty oppositeswhy what a king is thisdoes it not thinkst thee stand me now uponhe that hath killed my king and whored my motherpopped in between the election and my hopesthrown out his angle for my proper lifeand with such cozenage is it not perfect consenceto quit him with this arm and is it not to be damnedto let this canker of our nature comein further evilit must be shortly known to him from Englandwhat is the issue of the business thereit will be short the interim is mineand a mans lifes no more than to say one but I am very sorry good Horatiothat to Laertes I forgot myselffor by the image of my cause I seethe portraiture of his iull count his favoursbut sure the bravery of his grief did put meinto a towering passionpeace who comes hereyour lordship is right welcome back to DenmarkI humbly thank you sirdost know this water-flyno my good lordthy state is the more gracious for itis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess itis a chough but as I say spaous in the possession of dirtsweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his majestyI will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit your bonnet to his right use itis for the headI thank your lordship itis very hotno believe me itis very cold the wind is northerlyit is indifferent cold my lord indeedbut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexionexceedingly my lord it is very sultry as itwere I cannot tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matterI beseech you remembernay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would seesir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing moreyour lordship speaks most infallibly of himthe concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breathsiris it not possible to understand in another tongue you will doit sir reallywhat imports the nomination of this gentlemanof Laerteshis purse is empty already all s golden words are spentof him sirI know you are not ignorantI would you did sir in faith if you did it would not much approve me well siryou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes isI dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himselfI mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowedwhats his weaponrapier and daggerthats two of his weapons but wellthe king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary horses against the which he has imponed as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceitwhat call you the carriagesI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had donethe carriages sir are the hangersthe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then but on six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberal-conceited carriages thats the French bet against the Danish why is this imponed as you call itthe king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answerhow if I answer noI mean my lord the opposition of your person in trialsir I will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty itis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hitsshall I re-deliver you soto this effect sir after what flourish your nature willI commend my duty to your lordshipyours yourshe does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for s turnthis lapwing runs away with the shell on his headhe did comply with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are outmy lord his majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer timeI am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as nowthe king and queen and all are coming downin happy timethe queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to playshe well instructs meyou will lose this wager my lordI do not think so since he went into France I have been in continual practice I shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all s here about my heart but it is no matternay good my lordit is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain-giving as

givesthis war-like volleyO I die Horatiothe potent poison quite oer-crows my spiritI cannot live to hear the news from Englandbut I do prophesy the election lightson fortinbras he has my dying voiceso tell him with the occurrents more and lesswhich have solited the rest is silencenow cracks a noble heart Good-night sweet princeand flights of angels sing thee to thy restwhy does the drum come hitherwhere is this sightwhat is it ye would seeif aught of woe or wonder cease your searchthis quarry cries on havoc O proud deathwhat feast is toward in thine eternal cellthat thou so many princes at a shotso bloodily hast struckthe sight is dismaland our affairs from England come too latethe ears are senseless that should give us hearingto tell him his commandment is fulfilledthat Rosencrantz and guildenstern are deadwhere should we have our thanksnot from his mouthhad it the ability of life to thank youhe never gave commandment for their deathbut since so jump upon this bloody questionyou from the Polack wars and you from Englandare here arrived give order that these bodieshigh on a stage be placed to the viewand let me speak to the yet unknowing worldhow these things came about so shall you hearof carnal bloody and unnatural actsof acdental judgments casual slaughtersof deaths put on by cunning and forced causeand in this upshot purposes mistookfalln on the inventors heads all this can Itruly deliverlet us haste to hear itand call the noblest to the audiencefor me with sorrow I embrace my fortuneI have some rights of memory in this kingdomwhich now to claim my vantage doth invite meof that I shall have also cause to speakand from his mouth whose voice will draw on morebut let this same be presently performedeven while mens minds are wild lest more mischanceon plots and errors happenlet four captainsbear Hamlet like a soldier to the stagefor he was likely had he been put onto have proved most royally and for his passagethe soldiers music and the rites of warspeak loudly for himtake up the bodies such a sight as thisbecomes the field but here shows much amissgo bid the soldiers shoothence home you idle creatures get you homeis this a holiday what know you notbeing mechanical you ought not walkupon a labouring day without the signof your profession speak what trade art thouwhy sir a carpenterwhere is thy leather apron and thy rulewhat dost thou with thy best apparel onyou sir what trade are youtruly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobblerbut what trade art thou Answer me directlya trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe consence which is indeed sir a mender of bad soleswhat trade thou knave thou naughty knave what tradenay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir I can mend youwhat meanest thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellowwhy sir cobble youthou art a cobbler art thoutruly sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger I recover them as proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiworkbut wherefore art not in thy shop to-daywhy dost thou lead these men about the streetstruly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see Ceasar and to rejoice in his triumphwherefore rejoice what conquest brings he homewhat tributaries follow him to Rometo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheelsyou blocks you stones you worse than senseless thingsO you hard hearts you cruel men of Romeknew you not Pompey many a time and ofthave you climbed up to walls and battlementsto towers and windows yea to chimney-topsyour infants in your arms and there have satthe livelong day with patient expectationto see great Pompey pass the streets of Romeand when you saw his chariot but appearhave you not made a universal shoutthat Tiber trembled underneath her banksto hear the replication of your soundsmade in her concave shoresand do you now put on your best attireand do you now cull out a holidayand do you now strew flowers in his waythat comes in triumph over Pompeys bloodbe gonerun to your houses fall upon your kneespray to the gods to intermit the plaguethat needs must light on this ingratitudego go good countrymen and for this faultassemble all the poor men of your sortdraw them to Tiber banks and weep your tearsinto the channel till the lowest streamdo kiss the most exalted shores of allsee wher their basest metal be not movedthey vanish tongue-tied in their guiltinessgo you down that way towards the capitolthis way will I Disrobe the imagesif you do find them decked with ceremoniesmay we do soyou know it is the feast of Lupercalit is no matter let no imagesbe hung with Ceasars trophies iull aboutand drive away the vulgar from the streetsso do you too where you perceive them thickthese growing feathers plucked from Ceasars wingwill make him fly an ordinary pitchwho else would soar above the view of menand keep us all in servile fearfulnesscalphurniapeace ho Ceasar speakscalphurniahere my lordstand you directly in Antonius waywhen he doth run his course AntoniusCeasar my lordforget not in your speed Antoniusto touch Calphurnia for our elders saythe barren touched in this holy chaseshake off their sterile curseI shall rememberwhen Ceasar says edo this it is performedset on and leave no ceremony outCeasarha who callsbid every noise be still peace yet againwho is it in the press that calls on meI hear a tongue shriller than all the musiccry Ceasar speak Ceasar is turned to hearbeware the ides of marchwhat man is thata soothsayer bids you beware the ides of marchset him before me let me see his facefellow come from the throng look upon Ceasarwhat sayst thou to me now speak once againbeware the ides of marchhe is a dreamer let us leave him passwill you go see the order of the coursenot II pray you doI am not gamesome I do lack some partof that quick spirit that is in Antonylet me not hinder Cassius your desiresiull leave youBrutus I do observe you now of lateI have not from your eyes that gentlenessand show of love as I was wont to haveyou bear too stubborn and too strange a handover your friend that loves youcassiusbe not deceived if I have veiled my lookI turn the trouble of my countenancemerely upon myself Vexed I amof late with passions of some differenceconceptions only proper to myselfwhich give some soil perhaps to my behavioursbut let not therefore my good friends be grievedamong which number Cassius be you onenor construe any further my neglectthan that poor Brutus with himself at warforgets the shows of love to other menthen Brutus I have much mistook your passionby means whereof this breast of mine hath buriedthoughts of great value worthy cogitationstell me good Brutus can you see your faceno Cassius for the eye sees not itselfbut by reflection by some other thingsitis justand it is very much lamented Brutusthat you have no such mirrors as will turnyour hidden worthiness into your eyethat you might see your shadow I have heardwhere many of the best respect in Romeexcept immortal Ceasar speaking of Brutusand groaning underneath this ages yokehave wished that noble Brutus had his eyesinto what dangers would you lead me Cassiusthat you would have me seek into myselffor that which is not in metherefore good Brutus be prepared to hearand since you know you cannot see yourselfso well as by reflection I your glasswill modestly discover to yourselfthat of yourself which you yet know not ofand be not jealous on me gentle Brutuswere I a common laugher or did useto stale with ordinary oaths my loveto every new protester if you knowthat I do fawn on men and hug them hardand after scandal them or if you knowthat I profess myself in banquetingto all the rout then hold me dangerouswhat means this shouting I do fear the peoplechoose Ceasar for their kingay do you fear itthen must I think you would not have it soI would not Cassius yet I love him wellbut wherefore do you hold me here so longwhat is it that you would impart to meif it be aught toward the general goodset honour in one eye and death inthe otherand I will look on both indifferentlyfor let the gods so speed me as I lovethe name of honour more than I fear deathI know that virtue to be in you Brutusas well as I do know your outward favourwell honour is the subject of my storyI cannot tell what you and other menthink of this life but for my single selfI had as lief not be as live to bein awe of such a thing as I myselfI was born free as Ceasar so were youwe both have fed as well and we can bothendure the winters cold as well as hefor once upon a raw and gusty daythe troubled Tiber chafing with her shoresCeasar said to me edarest thou Cassius nowleap in with me into this angry floodand swim to yonder point upon the wordaccoutred as I was I plunged inand bade him follow so indeed he didthe torrent roared and we did buffet itwith lusty sinews throwing it asideand stemming it with hearts of controversybut ere we could arrive the point proposedCeasar cried help me Cassius or I sink I asneas our great ancestordid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulderthe old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiberdid I the tired Ceasar and this manis now become a god and Cassius isa wretched creature and must bend his bodyif Ceasar carelessly but nod on himhe had a fever when he was in Spainand when the fit was on him I did markhow he did shake itis true this god did shakehis coward lips did from their colour flyand that same eye whose bend doth awe the worlddid lose his lustre I did hear him groanay and that tongue of his that bade the Romansmark him and write his speeches in their booksalas it cried give me some drink Titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze mea man of such a feeble temper shouldso get the start of the majestic worldand bear the palm aloneanother general shoutI do believe that these applauses arefor some new honours that are heaped on Ceasarwhy man he doth bestride the narrow worldlike a Colossus and we petty menwalk under his huge legs and peep aboutto find ourselves dishonourable gravesmen at some time are masters of their fatesthe fault dear Brutus is not in our starsbut in ourselves that we are underlingsBrutus and Ceasar what should be in that Ceasar why should that name be sounded more than yourswrite them together yours is as fair a namesound them it doth become the mouth as wellweigh them it is as heavy conjure with emBrutus will start a spirit as soon as Ceasar now in the names of all the gods at onceupon what meat doth this our Ceasar feedthat he is grown so great Age thou art shamedRome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloodswhen went there by an age since the great floodbut it was famed with more than with one manwhen could they say till now that talked of Romethat her wide walls encompassed but one mannow is it Rome indeed and room enoughwhen there is in it but one only manO you and I have heard our fathers saythere was a Brutus once that would have brookedth eternal devil to keep his state in Romeas easily as a kingthat you do love me I am nothing jealouswhat you would work me to I have some aimhow I have thought of this and of these timesI shall recount hereafter for this presentI would not so with love I might entreat yoube any further moved what you have saidI will consider what you have to sayI will with patience hear and find a timeboth meet to hear and answer such high thingstill then my noble friend chew upon thisBrutus had rather be a villagerthan to repute himself a son of Romeunder these hard conditions as this timeis like to lay upon usI am gladthat my weak words have struck but thus much showof fire from Brutusthe games are done and Ceasar is returningas they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeveand he will after his sour fashion tell youwhat hath proceeded worthy note to-dayI will do so but look you Cassiusthe angry spot doth glow on Ceasars browand all the rest look like a chidden traincalphurnias cheek is pale and cerolooks with such ferret and such fiery eyesas we have seen him in the capitolbeing crossed in conference by some senatorscasca will tell us what the matter isantoniusCeasarlet me have men about me that are fatsleek-headed men and such as sleep o nightsyond Cassius has a lean and hungry lookhe thinks too much such men are dangerousfear him not Ceasar hes not dangeroushe is a noble Roman and well givenwould he were fatter but I fear him notyet if my name were liable to fearI do not know the man I should avoidso soon as that spare Cassius he reads muchhe is a great observer and he looksquite through the deeds of men he loves no playsas thou dost Antony he hears no musicseldom he smiles and smiles in such a sortas if he mocked himself and scorned his spiritthat could be moved to smile at any thingsuch men as he be never at hearts easewhiles they behold a greater than themselvesand therefore are they very dangerousI rather tell thee what is to be fearedthan what I fear for always I am Ceasarcome on my right hand for this ear is deafand tell me truly what thou thinkest of himyou pulled me by the cloak would you speak with meay Casca tell us what hath chanced to-daythat Ceasar looks so sadwhy you were with him were you notI should not then ask Casca what had chancedwhy there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a-shoutingwhat was the second noise forwhy for that toothey shouted thrice what was the last cry forwhy for that toowas the crown offered him thriceay marry was'tand he put it by thrice everytime gentler than other and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shoutedwho offered him the crownwhy Antonytell us the manner of it gentle CascaI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw mark Antony offer him a crown yet itwas not a crown neither itwas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement shouted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Ceasar refused the crown that it had almost choked Ceasar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad airbut soft I pray you what did Ceasar swoundhe fell down in the market-place and foamed at mouth and was speechlessitis very like he hath the falling-sicknessno Ceasar hath it not but you and I and honest Casca we have the falling-sicknessI know not what you mean by that but I am sure Ceasar fell down if the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true manwhat said he when he came unto himselfmarry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut An I had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but theres no head to be taken of them if Ceasar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no lessand after that he came thus sad awayaydid cero say any thingay he spoke Greekto what effectnay an I tell you that iull neer look you inthe face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off Ceasars images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if I could remember itwill you sup with me to-night Cascano I am promised forthwill you dine with me to-morroway if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eatinggood I will expect youdo so farewell bothwhat a blunt fellow is this grown to behe was quick mettle when he went to schoolso is he now in executionof any bold or noble enterprisehowever he puts on this tardy formthis rudeness is a sauce to his good witwhich gives men stomach to digest his wordswith better appetiteand so it is for this time I will leave youto-morrow if you please to speak with meI will come home to you or if you willcome home to me and I will wait for youI will do so till then think of the worldwell Brutus thou art noble yet I seethy honourable metal may be wroughtfrom that it is disposed therefore itis meetthat noble minds keep ever with their likesfor who so firm that cannot be seducedCeasar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutusif I were Brutus now and he were Cassiushe should not humour me I will this nightin several hands in at his windows throwas if they came from several tizenswritings all tending to the great opinionthat Rome holds of his name wherein obscurelyCeasars ambition shall be glanced atand after this let Ceasar seat him surefor we will shake him or worse days enduregood even Casca brought you Ceasar homewhy are you breathless and why stare you soare not you moved when all the sway of earthshakes like a thing unfirm O ceroI have seen tempests when the scolding windshave rived the knotty oaks and I have seenthe ambitious ocean swell and rage and foamto be exalted with the threatning cloudsbut never till to-night never till nowdid I go through a tempest dropping fireeither there is a vile strife in heavenor else the world too saucy with the godsincenses them to send destructionwhy saw you any thing more wonderfula common slave you know him well by sightheld up his left hand which did flame and burnlike twenty torches joined and yet his handnot sensible of fire remained unscorchedbesides I have not since put up my swordagainst the capitol I met a honwho glared upon me and went surly bywithout annoying me and there were drawnupon a heap a hundred ghastly womentransformed with their fear who swore they sawmen all in fire walk up and down the streetsand yesterday the bird of night did siteven at noon-day upon the market-placehooting and shrieking when these prodigiesdo so conjointly meet let not men saythese are their reasons they are natural for I believe they are portentous thingsunto the climate that they point uponindeed it is a strange-disposed timebut men may construe things after their fashionclean from the purpose of the things themselvescomes Ceasar to the capitol to-morrowhe doth for he did bid Antoniussend word to you he would be there to-morrowgood-night then Casca this disturbed skyis not to walk infarewell cerowhos therea Romancasca by your voiceyour ear is good Cassius what night is thisa very pleasing night to honest menwho ever knew the heavens menace sothose that have known the earth so full of faultsfor my part I have walked about the streetssubmitting me unto the perilous nightand thus unbraced Casca as you seehave bared my bosom to the thunder-stoneand when the cross blue lightning seemed to openthe breast of heaven I did present myselfeven in the aim and very flash of itbut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavensit is the part of men to fear and tremblewhen the most mighty gods by tokens sendsuch dreadful heralds to astonish usyou are dull Casca and those sparks of lifethat should be in a Roman you do wantor else you use not you look pale and gazeand put on fear and cast yourself in wonderto see the strange impatience of the heavensbut if you would consider the true causewhy all these fires why all these gliding ghostswhy birds and beasts from quality and kindwhy old men fools and children calculatewhy all these things change from their ordinancetheir natures and pre-formed facultiesto monstrous quality why you shall findthat heaven hath infused them with these spiritsto make them instruments of fear and warningunto some monstrous statenow could I Casca name to thee a manmost like this dreadful nightthat thunders lightens opens graves and roarsas doth the lion in the capitola man no mightier than thyself or mein personal action yet prodigious grownand fearful as these strange eruptions areitis Ceasar that you mean is it not Cassiuslet it be who it is for Romans nowhave thews and limbs like to their ancestorsbut woe the while our fathers minds are deadand we are governed with our mothers spiritsour yoke and sufferance show us womanishindeed they say the senators to-morrowmean to establish Ceasar as a kingand he shall wear his crown by sea and landin every place save here in ItalyI know where I will wear this dagger thencassius from bondage will deliver Cassiustherein ye gods you make the weak most strongtherein ye gods you tyrants do defeatnor stony tower nor walls of beaten brassnor airless dungeon nor strong links of ironcan be retentive to the strength of spiritbut life being weary of those worldly barsnever lacks power to dismiss itselfif I know this know all the world besidesthat part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake off at pleasureso can Iso every bondman in his own hand bearsthe power to cancel his captivityand why should Ceasar be a tyrant thenpoor man I know he would not be a wolfbut that he sees the Romans are but sheephe were no lion were not Romans hindsthose that with haste will make a mighty firebegin it with weak straws what trash is Romewhat rubbish and what offal when it servesfor the base matter to illuminateso vile a thing as Ceasar but O griefwhere hast thou led me I perhaps speak thisbefore a willing bondman then I knowmy answer must be made but I am armedand dangers are to me indifferentyou speak to Casca and to such a manthat is no fleering tell-tale hold my handbe factious for redress of all these griefsand I will set this foot of mine as faras who goes furthesttheres a bargain madenow know you Casca I have moved alreadysome certain of the noblest-minded Romansto undergo with me an enterpriseof honourable-dangerous consequenceand I do know by this they stay for mein Pompeys porch for now this fearful nightthere is no stir or walking in the streetsand the complexion of the elementin favours like the work we have in handmost bloody fiery and most terriblestand close awhile for here comes one in hasteitis nna I do know him by his gaithe is a friendnna where haste you soto find out you whos that Metellus mberno it is Casca one incorporateto our attempts Am I not stayed for nnaI am glad onit what a fearful night is thistheres two or three of us have seen strange sightsam I not stayed for Tell meyes you areO Cassius if you couldbut win the noble Brutus to our partybe you content Good nna take this paperand look you lay it in the pr tors chairwhere Brutus may but find it and throw thisin at his window set this up with waxupon old Brutus statue all this donerepair to Pompeys porch where you shall find usis Deus Brutus and Trebonius thereall but Metellus mber and hes goneto seek you at your house well I will hieand so bestow these papers as you bade methat done repair to Pompeys theatrecome Casca you and I will yet ere daysee Brutus at his house three parts of himis ours already and the man entireupon the next encounter yields him oursO he sits high in all the peoples heartsand that which would appear offence in ushis countenance like richest alchemywill change to virtue and to worthinesshim and his worth and our great need of himyou have right well conceited let us gofor it is after midnight and ere daywe will awake him and be sure of himwhat Luus hoI cannot by the progress of the starsgive guess how near to day Luus I sayI would it were my fault to sleep so soundlywhen Luus when Awake I say what Luuscalled you my lordget me a taper in my study Luuswhen it is lighted come and call me hereI will my lordit must be by his death and for my partI know no personal cause to spurn at himbut for the general he would be crownedhow that might change his nature theres the questionit is the bright day that brings forth the adderand that craves wary walking crown him thatand then I grant we put a sting in himthat at his will he may do danger withthe abuse of greatness is when it disjoinsremorse from power and to speak truth of CeasarI have not known when his affections swayedmore than his reason but itis a common proofthat lowliness is young ambitions ladderwhereto the climber-upward turns his facebut when he once attains the upmost roundhe then unto the ladder turns his backlooks in the clouds scorning the base degreesby which he did ascend so Ceasar maythen lest he may prevent and since the quarrelwill bear no colour for the thing he isfashion it thus that what he is augmentedwould run to these and these extremitiesand therefore think him as a serpents eggwhich hatched would as his kind grow mischievousand kill him in the shellthe taper burneth in your closet sirsearching the window for a flint I foundthis paper thus sealed up and I am sureit did not lie there when I went to bedget you to bed again it is not dayis not to-morrow boy the ides of marchI know not sirlook in the calendar and bring me wordI will sirthe exhalations whizzing in the airgive so much light that I may read by themBrutus thou sleepest awake and see thyselfshall Rome &c speak strike redressBrutus thou sleepest awakesuch instigations have been often droppedwhere I have took them upshall Rome &c thus must I piece it outshall Rome stand under one mans awe what Romemy ancestors did from the streets of Romethe Tarquin drive when he was called a kingspeak strike redress Am I entreatedto speak and strike O Rome I make thee promiseif the redress will follow thou receivestthy full petition at the hand of Brutussir march is wasted fourteen daysitis good go to the gate somebody knockssince Cassius first did whet me against CeasarI have not sleptbetween the acting of a dreadful thingand the first motion all the interim islike a phantasma or a hideous dreamthe genius and the mortal instrumentsare then in counseland the state of manlike to a little kingdom suffers thenthe nature of an insurrectionsir itis your brother Cassius at the doorwho doth desire to see youis he aloneno sir there are more with himdo you know themno sir their hats are plucked about their earsand half their faces buried in their cloaksthat by no means I may discover themby any mark of favourlet em enterthey are the faction O conspiracyshamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by nightwhen evils are most free O then by daywhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enoughto mask thy monstrous visage Seek none conspiracyhide it in smiles and affabilityfor if thou path thy native semblance onnot erebus itself were dim enoughto hide thee from preventionI think we are too bold upon your restgood morrow Brutus do we trouble youI have been up this hour awake all nightknow I these men that come along with youyes every man of them and no man herebut honours you and every one doth wishyou had but that opinion of yourselfwhich every noble Roman bears of youthis is Treboniushe is welcome hitherthis Deus Brutushe is welcome toothis Casca this nnaand this Metellus mberthey are all welcomewhat watchful cares do interpose themselvesbetwixt your eyes and nightshall I entreat a wordhere lies the east doth not the day break herenoO pardon sir it doth and yon grey linesthat fret the clouds are messengers of dayyou shall confess that you are both deceivedhere as I point my sword the sun ariseswhich is a great way growing on the southweighing the youthful season of the yearsome two months hence up higher toward the northhe first presents his fire and the high eaststands as the capitol directly heregive me your hands all over one by oneand let us swear our resolutionno not an oath if not the face of menthe sufferance of our souls the times abuseif these be motives weak break off betimesand every man hence to his idle bedso let high-sighted tyranny range ontill each man-drop by lottery but if theseas I am sure they do bear fire enoughto kindle cowards and to steel with valourthe melting spirits of women then countrymenwhat need we any spur but our own causeto prick us to redress what other bondthan secret Romans that have spoke the wordand will not palter and what other oaththan honesty to honesty engagedthat this shall be or we will fall for itswear priests and cowards and men cautelousold feeble carrions and such suffering soulsthat welcome wrongs unto bad causes swearsuch creatures as men doubt but do not stainthe even virtue of our enterprisenor th insuppressive mettle of our spiritsto think that or our cause or our performancedid need an oath when every drop of bloodthat every Roman bears and nobly bearsis guilty of a several bastardyif he do break the smallest particleof any promise that hath passed from himbut what of cero Shall we sound himI think he will stand very strong with uslet us not leave him outno by no meansO let us have him for his silver hairswill purchase us a good opinionand buy mens voices to commend our deedsit shall be said his judgment ruled our handsour youths and wildness shall no whit appearbut all be buried in his gravityO name him not let us not break with himfor he will never follow any thingthat other men beginthen leave him outindeed he is not fitshall no man else be touched but only Ceasardeus well urged I think it is not meetmark Antony so well beloved of Ceasarshould outlive Ceasar we shall find of hima shrewd contriver and you know his meansif he improve them may well stretch so faras to annoy us all which to preventlet Antony and Ceasar fall togetherour course will seem too bloody Caius Cassiusto cut the head off and then hack the limbslike wrath in death and envy afterwardsfor Antony is but a limb of Ceasarlet us be sacrificers but not butchers Caiuswe all stand up against the spirit of Ceasarand in the spirit of men there is no bloodO then that we could come by Ceasars spiritand not dismember Ceasar but alasCeasar must bleed for it and gentle friendslets kill him boldly but not wrathfullylets carve him as a dish fit for the godsnot hew him as a carcass fit for houndsand let our hearts as subtle masters dostir up their servants to an act of rageand after seem to chide em this shall makeour purpose necessary and not enviouswhich so appearing to the common eyeswe shall be called purgers not murderersand for mark Antony think not of himfor he can do no more than Ceasars armwhen Ceasars head is offyet I fear himfor in the engrafted love he bears to Ceasaralas good Cassius do not think of himif he love Ceasar all that he can dois to himself take thought and die for Ceasarand that were much he should for he is givento sports to wildness and much companythere is no fear in him let him not diefor he will live and laugh at this hereafterpeace count the clockthe clock hath stricken threeitis time to partbut it is doubtful yetwhether Ceasar will come forth to-day or nofor he is superstitious grown of latequite from the main opinion he held onceof fantasy of dreams and ceremoniesit may be these apparent prodigiesthe unaccustomed terror of this nightand the persuasion of his augurersmay hold him from the capitol to-daynever fear that if he be so resolvedI can oersway him for he loves to hearthat unicorns may be betrayed with treesand bears with glasses elephants with holeslions with toils and men with flatterersbut when I tell him he hates flatterershe says he does being then most flatteredlet me workfor I can give his humour the true bentand I will bring him to the capitolnay we will all of us be there to fetch himby the eighth hour is that the uttermostbe that the uttermost and fail not thencaius Ligarius doth bear Ceasar hardwho rated him for speaking well of PompeyI wonder none of you have thought of himnow good Metellus go along by himhe loves me well and I have given him reasonssend him but hither and iull fashion himthe morning comes upon s well leave you Brutusand friends disperse yourselves but all rememberwhat you have said and show yourselves true Romansgood gentlemen look fresh and merrilylet not our looks put on our purposesbut bear it as our Roman actors dowith untired spirits and formal constancyand so good morrow to you every oneboy Luus fast asleep it is no matterenjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumberthou hast no figures nor no fantasieswhich busy care draws in the brains of mentherefore thou sleepest so soundBrutus my lordportia what mean you wherefore rise you nowit is not for your health thus to commityour weak condition to the raw cold morningnor for yours neither youve ungently Brutusstole from my bed and yesternight at supperyou suddenly arose and walked aboutmusing and sighing with your arms acrossand when I asked you what the matter wasyou stared upon me with ungentle looksI urged you further then you scratched your headand too impatiently stamped with your footyet I insisted yet you answered notbut with an angry wafture of your handgave sign for me to leave you so I didfearing to strengthen that impatiencewhich seemed too much enkindled and withalhoping it was but an effect of humourwhich sometime hath his hour with every manit will not let you eat nor talk nor sleepand could it work so much upon your shapeas it hath much prevailed on your conditionI should not know you Brutus dear my lordmake me acquainted with your cause of griefI am not well in health and that is allBrutus is wise and were he not in healthhe would embrace the means to come by itwhy so I do Good Portia go to bedis Brutus sick and is it physicalto walk unbraced and suck up the humoursof the dank morning what is Brutus sickand will he steal out of his wholesome bedto dare the vile contagion of the nightand tempt the rheumy and unpurged airto add unto his sickness no my Brutusyou have some sick offence within your mindwhich by the right and virtue of my placeI ought to know of and upon my kneesI charm you by my once-commended beautyby all your vows of love and that great vowwhich did incorporate and make us onethat you unfold to me your self your halfwhy are you heavy and what men to-nighthave had resort to you for here have beensome six or seven who did hide their faceseven from darknesskneel not gentle PortiaI should not need if you were gentle Brutuswithin the bond of marriage tell me Brutusis it excepted I should know no secretsthat appertain to you Am I yourselfbut as it were in sort of limitationto keep with you at meals comfort your bedand talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbsof your good pleasure if it be no moreportia is Brutus harlot not his wifeyou are my true and honourable wifeas dear to me as are the ruddy dropsthat visit my sad heartif this were true then should I know this secretI grant I am a woman but withala woman that lord Brutus took to wifeI grant I am a woman but withala woman well-reputed Catos daughterthink you I am no stronger than my sexbeing so fathered and so husbandedtell me your counsels I will not disclose emI have made strong proof of my constancygiving myself a voluntary woundhere in the thigh can I bear that with patienceand not my husbands secretsO ye godsrender me worthy of this noble wifehark hark one knocks Portia go in awhileand by and by thy bosom shall partakethe secrets of my heartall my engagements I will construe to theeall the charactery of my sad browsleave me with hasteLuus whos that knockshere is a sick man that would speak with youcaius Ligarius that Metellus spoke ofboy stand aside Caius Ligarius howvouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongueO what a time have you chose out brave Caiusto wear a kerchief would you were not sickI am not sick if Brutus have in handany exploit worthy the name of honoursuch an exploit have I in hand Ligariushad you a healthful ear to hear of itby all the gods that Romans bow beforeI here discard my sickness Soul of Romebrave son derived from honourable loinsthou like an exorst hast conjured upmy mortified spirit now bid me runand I will strive with things impossibleyea get the better of them whats to doa piece of work that will make sick men wholebut are not some whole that we must make sickthat must we also what it is my CaiusI shall unfold to thee as we are goingto whom it must be doneset on your footand with a heart new-fired I follow youto do I know not what but it sufficeththat Brutus leads me onfollow me thennor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-nightthrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried outhelp ho they murder Ceasar whos withinmy lordgo bid the priests do present sacrificeand bring me their opinions of successI will my lordwhat mean you Ceasar think you to walk forthyou shall not stir out of your house to-dayCeasar shall forth the things that threatened meneer looked but on my back when they shall seethe face of Ceasar they are vanishedCeasar I never stood on ceremoniesyet now they fright me there is one withinbesides the things that we have heard and seenrecounts most horrid sights seen by the watcha lioness hath whelped in the streetsand graves have yawned and yielded up their deadfierce fiery warriors fought upon the cloudsin ranks and squadrons and right form of warwhich drizzled blood upon the capitolthe noise of battle hurtled in the airhorses did neigh and dying men did groanand ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streetsO Ceasar these things are beyond all useand I do fear themwhat can be avoidedwhose end is purposed by the mighty godsyet Ceasar shall go forth for these predictionsare to the world in general as to Ceasarwhen beggars die there are no comets seenthe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princescowards die many times before their deathsthe valiant never taste of death but onceof all the wonders that I yet have heardit seems to me most strange that men should fearseeing that death a necessary endwill come when it will comewhat say the augurersthey would not have you to stir forth to-dayplucking the entrails of an offering forththey could not find a heart within the beastthe gods do this in shame of cowardiceCeasar should be a beast without a heartif he should stay at home to-day for fearno Ceasar shall not danger knows full wellthat Ceasar is more dangerous than hewe are two lions littered in one dayand I the elder and more terribleand Ceasar shall go forthalas my lordyour wisdom is consumed in confidencedo not go forth to-day call it my fearthat keeps you in the house and not your ownwell send mark Antony to the senate-houseand he shall say you are not well to-daylet me upon my knee prevail in thismark Antony shall say I am not welland for thy humour I will stay at homeheres Deus Brutus he shall tell them soCeasar all hail Good morrow worthy CeasarI come to fetch you to the senate-houseand you are come in very happy timeto bear my greeting to the senatorsand tell them that I will not come to-daycannot is false and that I dare not falserI will not come to-day tell them so Deussay he is sickshall Ceasar send a liehave I in conquest stretched mine arm so farto be afeard to tell greybeards the truthdeus go tell them Ceasar will not comemost mighty Ceasar let me know some causelest I be laughed at when I tell them sothe cause is in my will I will not comethat is enough to satisfy the senatebut for your private satisfactionbecause I love you I will let you knowcalphurnia here my wife stays me at homeshe dreamt to-night she saw my statuawhich like a fountain with a hundred spoutsdid run pure blood and many lusty Romanscame smiling and did bathe their hands in itand these does she apply for warnings and portentsand evils imminent and on her kneehath begged that I will stay at home to-daythis dream is all amiss interpretedit was a vision fair and fortunateyour statue spouting blood in many pipesin which so many smiling Romans bathedsignifies that from you great Rome shall suckreviving blood and that great men shall pressfor tinctures stains relics and cognizancethis by Calphurnias dream is signifiedand this way have you well expounded itI have when you have heard what I can sayand know it now the senate have concludedto give this day a crown to mighty Ceasarif you shall send them word you will not cometheir minds may change besides it were a mockapt to be rendered for some one to saybreak up the senate till another timewhen Ceasars wife shall meet with better dreams if Ceasar hide himself shall they not whisperlo Ceasar is afraid pardon me Ceasar for my dear dear loveto your proceeding bids me tell you thisand reason to my love is liablehow foolish do your fears seem now CalphurniaI am ashamed I did yield to themgive me my robe for I will goand look where Publius is come to fetch megood morrow Ceasarwelcome Publiuswhat Brutus are you stirred so early toogood morrow Casca Caius LigariusCeasar was neer so much your enemyas that same ague which hath made you leanwhat isit oclockCeasar itis strucken eightI thank you for your pains and courtesysee Antony that revels long o nightsis notwithstanding up Good morrow Antonyso to most noble Ceasarbid them prepare withinI am to blame to be thus waited fornow nna now Metellus what TreboniusI have an hours talk in store for youremember that you call on me to-daybe near me that I may remember youCeasar I willand so near will I bethat your best friends shall wish I had been furthergood friends go in and taste some wine with meand we like friends will straightway go togetherthat every like is not the same O Ceasarthe heart of Brutus yearns to think uponCeasar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to nna trust not Trebonius mark well Metellus mber Deus Brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius there is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Ceasar if thou beest not immortal look about you security gives way to conspiracy the mighty gods defend thee thy loverhere will I stand till Ceasar pass alongand as a suitor will I give him thismy heart laments that virtue cannot liveout of the teeth of emulationif thou read this O Ceasar thou mayst liveif not the fates with traitors do contriveI prithee boy run to the senate-housestay not to answer me but get thee gonewhy dost thou stayto know my errand madamI would have had thee there and here againere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do thereO constancy be strong upon my sideset a huge mountainitween my heart and tongueI have a

word boy if thy lord look wellfor he went sickly forth and take good notewhat Ceasar doth what suitors press to himhark boy what noise is thatI hear none madamprithee listen wellI heard a bustling rumour like a frayand the wind brings it from the capitolsooth madam I hear nothingcome hither fellow which way hast thou beenat mine own house good ladywhat is it oclockabout the ninth hour ladyis Ceasar yet gone to the capitolmadam not yet I go to take my standto see him pass on to the capitolthou hast some suit to Ceasar hast thou notthat I have lady if it will please Ceasarto be so good to Ceasar as to hear meI shall beseech him to befriend himselfwhy knowest thou any harms intended towards himnone that I know will be much that I fear may chancegood morrow to you here the street is narrowthe throng that follows Ceasar at the heelsof senators of pr tors common suitorswill crowd a feeble man almost to deathiull get me to a place more void and therespeak to great Ceasar as he comes alongI must go in Ay me how weak a thingthe heart of woman is O Brutusthe heavens speed thee in thine enterprisesure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suitthat Ceasar will not grant O I grow faintrun Luus and commend me to my lordsay I am merry come to me againand bring me word what he doth say to theethe idea of march are comeay Ceasar but not gonehail Ceasar read this scheduletrebonius doth desire you to oer-readat your best leisure this his humble suitO Ceasar read mine first for mines a suitthat touches Ceasar nearer read it great Ceasarwhat touches us ourself shall be last serveddelay not Ceasar read it instantlywhat is the fellow madsirrah give placewhat urge you your petitions in the streetcome to the capitolI wish your enterprise to-day may thrivewhat enterprise Popiliusfare you wellwhat said Popilius Lenahe wished to-day our enterprise might thriveI fear our purpose is discoveredlook how he makes to Ceasar mark himcasca be sudden for we fear preventionBrutus what shall be done if this be knowncassius or Ceasar never shall turn backfor I will slay myselfcassius be constantpopilius Lena speaks not of our purposesfor look he smiles and Ceasar doth not changetrebonius knows his time for look you Brutushe draws mark Antony out of the waywhere is Metellus mber let him goand presently prefer his suit to Ceasarhe is addressed press near and second himcasca you are the first that rears your handare we all ready what is now amissthat Ceasar and his senate must redressmost high most mighty and most puissant Ceasarmetellus mber throws before thy seata humble heartI must prevent thee mberthese couchings and these lowly courtesiesmight fire the blood of ordinary menand turn pre-ordinance and first decreeinto the law of children be not fondto think that Ceasar bears such rebel bloodthat will be thawed from the true qualitywith that which melteth fools I mean sweet wordslow-crooked curtsies and base spaniel fawningthy brother by decree is banishedif thou dost bend and pray and fawn for himI spurn thee like a cur out of my wayknow Ceasar doth not wrong nor without causewill he be satisfiedis there no voice more worthy than my ownto sound more sweetly in great Ceasars earfor the repealing of my banished brotherI kiss thy hand but not in flattery Ceasardesiring thee that Publius mber mayhave an immediate freedom of repealwhat Brutuspardon Ceasar Ceasar pardonas low as to thy foot doth Cassius fallto beg enfranchisement for Publius mberI could be well moved if I were as youif I could pray to move prayers would move mebut I am constant as the northern starof whose true-fixed and resting qualitythere is no fellow in the firmamentthe skies are painted with unnumbered sparksthey are all fire and every one doth shinebut theres but one in all doth hold his placeso in the world itis furnished well with menand men are flesh and blood and apprehensiveyet in the number I do know but onethat unassailable holds on his rankunshaked of motion and that I am helet me a little show it even in thisthat I was constant mber should be banishedand constant do remain to keep him soO Ceasarhence wilt thou lift up Olympusgreat Ceasardoth not Brutus bootless kneelspeak hands for meet tu Brute then fall Ceasarliberty Freedom tyra<nny is deadrun hence proclaim cry it about the streetssome to the common pulpits and cry outliberty freedom and enfranchisement people and senators be not affrightedfly not stand still ambitions debt is paidgo to the pulpit Brutusand Cassius toowheres Publiushere quite confounded with this mutinystand fast together lest some friend of Ceasarsshould chancetalk not of standing Publius good cheerthere is no harm intended to your personnor to no Roman else so tell them Publiusand leave us Publius lest that the peoplerushing on us should do your age some mischiefdo so and let no man abide this deedbut we the doerswheres Antonyfled to his house amazedmen wives and children stare cry out and runas it were doomsdayfates we will know your pleasuresthat we shall die we know itis but the timeand drawing days out that men stand uponwhy he that cuts off twenty years of lifecuts off so many years of fearing deathgrant that and then is death a benefitso are we Ceasars friends that have abridgedhis time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoopand let us bathe our hands in Ceasars bloodup to the elbows and besmear our swordsthen walk we forth even to the market-placeand waving our red weapons oer our headslets all cry peace freedom and liberty stoop then and wash how many ages henceshall this our lofty scene be acted oerin states unborn and accents yet unknownhow many times shall Ceasar bleed in sportthat now on Pompeys basis lies alongno worthier than the dustso oft as that shall beso often shall the knot of us be calledthe men that gave their country libertywhat shall we forthay every man awayBrutus shall lead and we will grace his heelswith the most boldest and best hearts of Romesoft who comes here a friend of Antonysthus Brutus did my master bid me kneelthus did mark Antony bid me fall downand being prostrate thus he bade me sayBrutus is noble wise valiant and honestCeasar was mighty bold royal and lovingsay I love Brutus and I honour himsay I feared Ceasar honoured him and loved himif Brutus will vouchsafe that Antonymay safely come to him and be resolvedhow Ceasar hath deserved to lie in deathmark Antony shall not love Ceasar deadso well as Brutus living but will followthe fortunes and affairs of noble Brutusthorough the hazards of this untrod statewith all true faith so says my master Antonythy master is a wise and valiant RomanI never thought him worsetell him so please him come unto this placehe shall be satisfied and by my honourdepart untouchediull fetch him presentlyI know that we shall have him well to friendI wish we may but yet have I a mindthat fears him much and my misgiving stillfalls shrewdly to the purposebut here comes Antony welcome mark AntonyO mighty Ceasar dost thou lie so loware all thy conquests glories triumphs spoilsshrunk to this little measure fare thee wellI know not gentlemen what you intendwho else must be let blood who else is rankif I myself there is no hour so fitas Ceasars deaths hour nor no instrumentof half that worth as those your swords made richwith the most noble blood of all this worldI do beseech ye if ye bear me hardnow whilst your purpled hands do reek and smokefulfil your pleasure Live a thousand yearsI shall not find myself so apt to dieno place will please me so no mean of deathas here by Ceasar and by you cut offthe choice and master spirits of this ageO Antony beg not your death of usthough now we must appear bloody and cruelas by our hands and this our present actyou see we do yet see you but our handsand this the bleeding business they have doneour hearts you see not they are pitifuland pity to the general wrong of Romeas fire drives out fire so pity pityhath done this deed on Ceasar for your partto you our swords have leaden points mark Antonyour arms in strength of malice and our heartsof brothers temper do receive you inwith all kind love good thoughts and reverenceyour voice shall be as strong as any mansin the disposing of new dignitiesonly be patient till we have appeasedthe multitude beside themselves with fearand then we will deliver you the causewhy I that did love Ceasar when I struck himhave thus proceededI doubt not of your wisdomlet each man render me his bloody handfirst Marcus Brutus will I shake with younext Caius Cassius do I take your handnow Deus Brutus yours now yours Metellusyours nna and my valiant Casca yoursthough last not least in love yours good Treboniusgentlemen all alas what shall I saymy credit now stands on such slippery groundthat one of two bad ways you must conceit meeither a coward or a flattererthat I did love thee Ceasar O itis trueif then thy spirit look upon us nowshall it not grieve thee dearer than thy deathto see thy Antony making his peaceshaking the bloody fingers of thy foesmost noble in the presence of thy corsehad I as many eyes as thou hast woundsweeping as fast as they stream forth thy bloodit would become me better than to closein terms of friendship with thine enemiespardon me Julius here wast thou bayed brave harthere didst thou fall and here thy hunters standsigned in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy lethO world thou wast the forest to this hartand this indeed O world the heart of theehow like a deer strucken by many princesdost thou here liemark Antonypardon me Caius Cassiusthe enemies of Ceasar shall say thisthen in a friend it is cold modestyI blame you not for praising Ceasar sobut what compact mean you to have with uswill you be pricked in number of our friendsor shall we on and not depend on youtherefore I took your hands but was indeedswayed from the point by looking down on Ceasarfriends am I with you all and love you allupon this hope that you shall give me reasonswhy and wherein Ceasar was dangerousor else were this a savage spectacleour reasons are so full of good regardthat were you Antony the son of Ceasaryou should be satisfiedthats all I seekand am moreover suitor that I mayproduce his body to the market placeand in the pulpit as becomes a friendspeak in the order of his funeralyou shall mark AntonyBrutus a word with youyou know not what you do do not consentthat Antony speak in his funeralknow you how much the people may be movedby that which he will utterby your pardonI will myself into the pulpit firstand show the reason of our Ceasars deathwhat Antony shall speak I will protesthe speaks by leave and by permissionand that we are contented Ceasar shallhave all true rites and lawful ceremoniesit shall advantage more than do us wrongI know not what may fall I like it notmark Antony here take you Ceasars bodyyou shall not in your funeral speech blame usbut speak all good you can devise of Ceasarand say you doit by our permissionelse shall you not have any hand at allabout his funeral and you shall speakin the same pulpit whereto I am goingafter my speech is endedbe it soI do desire no moreprepare the body then and follow usO pardon me thou bleeding piece of earththat I am meek and gentle with these butchersthou art the ruins of the noblest manthat ever lived in the tide of timeswoe to the hand that shed this costly bloodover thy wounds now do I prophesywhich like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lipsto beg the voice and utterance of my tonguea curse shall light upon the limbs of mendomestic fury and fierce civil strifeshall cumber all the parts of Italyblood and destruction shall be so in useand dreadful objects so familiarthat mothers shall but smile when they beholdtheir infants quartered with the hands of warall pity choked with custom of fell deedsand Ceasars spirit ranging for revengewith Ate by his side come hot from hellshall in these confines with a monarchs voicecry Havoc and let slip the dogs of warthat this foul deed shall smell above the earthwith carrion men groaning for burialyou serve Octavius Ceasar do you notI do mark AntonyCeasar did write for him to come to Romehe did receive his letters and is comingand bid me say to you by word of mouthO Ceasarthy heart is big get thee apart and weeppassion I see is catching for mine eyesseeing those beads of sorrow stand in thinebegan to water is thy master cominghe lies to-night within seven leagues of Romepost back with speed and tell him what hath chancedhare is a mourning Rome a dangerous Romeno Rome of safety for Octavius yethie hence and tell him so yet stay awhilethou shalt not back till I have borne this corpseinto the market-place there shall I tryin my oration how the people takethe cruel issue of these bloody menaccording to the which thou shalt discourseto young Octavius of the state of thingslead me your handwe will be satisfied let us be satisfiedthen follow me and give me audience friendscassius go you into the other streetand part the numbersthose that will hear me speak let em stay herethose that will follow Cassius go with himand public reasons shall be renderedof Ceasars deathI will hear Brutus speakI will hear Cassius and compare their reasonswhen severally we hear them renderedthe noble Brutus is ascended silencebe patient till the lastRomans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Ceasars to him I say that Brutus love to Ceasar was no less than his if then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Ceasar this is my answer not that I loved Ceasar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Ceasar were living and die all slaves than that Ceasar were dead to live all free men as Ceasar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honour him but as he was ambitious I slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have I offended who is here so rude that would not be a Roman if any speak for him have I offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have I offended I pause for a replynone Brutus nonethen none have I offended I have done no more to Ceasar than you shall do to Brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered deathhere comes his body mourned by mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my deathlive Brutus live livebring him with triumph home unto his housegive him a statue with his ancestorslet him be CeasarCeasars better partsshall be crowned in Brutuswell bring him to his house with shouts and clamoursmy countrymenpeace silence Brutus speakspeace hogood countrymen let me depart aloneand for my sake stay here with Antonydo grace to Ceasars corpse and grace his speechtending to Ceasars glories which mark Antonyby our permission is allowed to makeI do entreat you not a man departsave I alone till Antony have spokestay ho and let us hear mark Antonylet him go up into the public chairwell hear him noble Antony go upfor Brutus sake I am beholding to youwhat does he say of Brutushe says for Brutus sakehe finds himself beholding to us allitwere best he speak no harm of Brutus herethis Ceasar was a tyrantnay thats certainwe are blessed that Rome is rid of himpeace let us hear what Antony can sayyou gentle Romanspeace ho let us hear himfriends Romans countrymen lend me your earsI come to bury Ceasar not to praise himthe evil that men do lives after themthe good is oft interred with their bonesso let it be with Ceasar the noble Brutushath told you Ceasar was ambitiousif it were so it was a grievous faultand grievously hath Ceasar answered ithere under leave of Brutus and the restfor Brutus is an honourable manso are they all all honourable mencome I to speak in Ceasars funeralhe was my friend faithful and just to mebut Brutus says he was ambitiousand Brutus is an honourable manhe hath brought many captives home to Romewhose ransoms did the general coffers filldid this in Ceasar seem ambitiouswhen that the poor have cried Ceasar hath weptambition should be made of sterner stuffyet Brutus says he was ambitiousand Brutus is an honourable manyou all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crownwhich he did thrice refuse was this ambitionyet Brutus says he was ambitiousand sure he is an honourable manI speak not to disprove what Brutus spokebut here I am to speak what I do knowyou all did love him once not without causewhat cause withholds you then to mourn for himO judgment thou art fled to brutish beastsand men have lost their reason bear with memy heart is in the coffin there with Ceasarand I must pause till it come back to memethinks there is much reason in his sayingsif thou consider rightly of the matterCeasar has had great wronghas he mastersI fear there will a worse come in his placemarked ye his words he would not take the crowntherefore itis certain he was not ambitiousif it be found so some will dear abide itpoor soul his eyes are red as fire with weepingtheres not a nobler man in Rome than Antonynow mark him he begins again to speakbut yesterday the word of Ceasar mighthave stood against the world now lies he thereand none so poor to do him reverenceO masters if I were disposed to stiryour hearts and minds to mutiny and rageI should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrongwho you all know are honourable menI will not do them wrong I rather chooseto wrong the dead to wrong myself and youthan I will wrong such honourable menbut heres a parchment with the seal of CeasarI found it in his closet itis his willlet but the commons hear this testamentwhich pardon me I do not mean to readand they would go and kiss dead Ceasars woundsand dip their napkins in his sacred bloodyea beg a hair of him for memoryand dying mention it within their willsbequeathing it as a rich legacyunto their issuewell hear the will read it mark Antonythe will the will we will hear Ceasars willhave patience gentle friends I must not read itit is not meet you know how Ceasar loved youyou are not wood you are not stones but menand being men hearing the will of Ceasarit will inflame you it will make you maditis good you know not that you are his heirsfor if you should O what would come of itread the will well hear it Antonyyou shall read us the will Ceasars willwill you be patient Will you stay awhileI have oershot myself to tell you of itI fear I wrong the honourable menwhose daggers have stabbed Ceasar I do fear itthey were traitors honourable menthe will the testamentthey were villains murderers the will read the willyou will compel me then to read the willthen make a ring about the corpse of Ceasarand let me show you him that made the willshall I descend and will you give me leavecome downdescendyou shall have leavea ring stand roundstand from the hearse stand from the bodyroom for Antony most noble Antonynay press not so upon me stand far offstand back room bear backif you have tears prepare to shed them nowyou all do know this mantle I rememberthe first time ever Ceasar put it onitwas on a summers evening in his tentthat day he overcame the NerviIlook in this place ran Cassius dagger throughsee what a rent the envious Casca madethrough this the well-beloved Brutus stabbedand as he plucked his cursed steel awaymark how the blood of Ceasar followed itas rushing out of doors to be resolvedif Brutus so unkindly knocked or nofor Brutus as you know was Ceasars angeljudge O you gods how dearly Ceasar loved himthis was the most unkindest cut of allfor when the noble Ceasar saw him stabingratitude more strong than traitors armsquite vanquished him then burst his mighty heartand in his mantle muffling up his faceeven at the base of Pompeys statuswhich all the while ran blood great Ceasar fellO what a fall was there my countrymenthen I and you and all of us fell downwhilst bloody treason flourished over usO now you weep and I perceive you feelthe dint of pity these are gracious dropskind souls what weep you when you but beholdour Ceasars vesture wounded look you herehere is himself marred as you see with traitorsO piteous spectacleO noble CeasarO woeful dayO traitors villainsO most bloody sightwe will be revengedrevenge About Seek Burnfire kill Slay let not a traitor livestay countrymenpeace there Hear the noble Antonywell hear him well follow him well die with himgood friends sweet friends let me not stir you upto such a sudden flood of mutinythey that have done this deed are honourablewhat private griefs they have alas I know notthat made them do it they are wise and honourableand will no doubt with reasons answer youI come not friends to steal away your heartsI am no orator as Brutus isbut as you know me all a plain blunt manthat love my friend and that they know full wellthat gave me public leave to speak of himfor I have neither wit nor words nor worthaction nor utterance nor the power of speechto stir mens blood I only speak right onI tell you that which you yourselves do knowshow you sweet Ceasars wounds poor poor dumb mouthsand bid them speak for me but were I Brutusand Brutus Antony there were an Antonywould ruffle up your spirits and put a tonguein every wound of Ceasar that should movethe stones of Rome to rise and mutinywell mutinywell burn the house of Brutusaway then come seek the conspiratorsyet hear me countrymen yet hear me speakpeace ho Hear Antony most noble Antonywhy friends you go to do you know not whatwherein hath Ceasar thus deserved your lovesalas you know not I must tell you thenyou have forgot the will I told you ofmost true the will lets stay and hear the willhere is the will and under Ceasars sealto every Roman tizen he givesto every several man seventy-five drachmasmost noble Ceasar well revenge his deathO royal Ceasarhear me with patiencepeace homoreover he hath left you all his walkshis private arbours and new-planted orchardson this side Tiber he hath left them youand to your heirs for ever common pleasuresto walk abroad and recreate yourselveshere was a Ceasar when comes such anothernever never come away awaywell burn his body in the holy placeand with the brands fire the traitors housestake up the bodygo fetch firepluck down benchespluck down forms windows any thingnow let it work mischief thou art afoottake thou what course thou wilthow now fellowsir Octavius is already come to Romewhere is hehe and Lepidus are at Ceasars houseand thither will I straight to visit himhe comes upon a wish fortune is merryand in this mood will give us any thingI heard him say Brutus and Cassiusare rid like madmen through the gates of Romebelike they had some notice of the peoplehow I had moved them bring me to OctaviusI dreamt to-night that I did feast with Ceasarand things unlucky charge my fantasyI have no will to wander forth of doorsyet something leads me forthwhat is your namewhither are you goingwhere do you dwellare you a married man or a bacheloranswer every man directlyay and brieflyay and wiselyay and truly you were bestwhat is my name whither am I going where do I dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly wisely I say I am a bachelorthats as much as to say they are fools that marry youll bear me a bang for that I fear proceed directlydirectly I am going to Ceasars funeralas a friend or an enemyas a friendthat matter is answered directlyfor your dwelling brieflybriefly I dwell by the capitolyour name sir trulytruly my name is nnatear him to pieces hes a conspiratorI am nna the poet I am nna the poettear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad versesI am not nna the conspiratorit is no matter his names nna pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him goingtear him tear him come brands ho firebrands to Brutus to Cassius burn all Some to Deus house and some to Cascas some to Ligarius away gothese many then shall die their names are prickedyour brother too must die consent you LepidusI do consentprick him down Antonyupon condition Publius shall not livewho is your sisters son mark Antonyhe shall not live look with a spot I damn himbut Lepidus go you to Ceasars housefetch the will hither and we shall determinehow to cut off some charge in legaeswhat shall I find you hereor here or at the capitolthis is a slight unmeritable manmeet to be sent on errands is it fitthe three-fold world divided he should standone of the three to share itso you thought himand took his voice who should be pricked to diein our black sentence and proscriptionoctavius I have seen more days than youand though we lay these honours on this manto ease ourselves of divers slanderous loadshe shall but bear them as the ass bears goldto groan and sweat under the businesseither led or driven as we point the wayand having brought our treasure where we willthen take we down his load and turn him offlike to the empty ass to shake his earsand graze in commonsyou may do your willbut hes a tried and valiant soldierso is my horse Octavius and for thatI do appoint him store of provenderit is a creature that I teach to fightto wind to stop to run directly onhis corporal motion governed by my spiritand in some taste is Lepidus but sohe must be taught and trained and bid go fortha barren-spirited fellow one that feedson abject orts and imitationswhich out of use and staled by other menbegin his fashion do not talk of himbut as a property and now Octaviuslisten great things Brutus and Cassiusare levying powers we must straight make headtherefore let our alliance be combinedour best friends made and our best means stretched outand let us presently go sit in counselhow covert matters may be best disclosedand open perils surest answeredlet us do so for we are at the stakeand bayed about with many enemiesand some that smile have in their hearts I fearmillions of mischiefsstand hogive the word ho and standwhat now Lulius is Cassius nearhe is at hand and Pindarus is cometo do you salutation from his masterhe greets me well your master Pindarusin his own change or by ill officershath given me some worthy cause to wishthings done undone but if he be at handI shall be satisfiedI do not doubtbut that my noble master will appearsuch as he is full of regard and honourhe is not doubted a word Luliushow he received you let me be resolvedwith courtesy and with respect enoughbut not with such familiar instancesnor with such free and friendly conferenceas he hath used of oldthou hast describeda hot friend cooling Ever note Luliuswhen love begins to sicken and decayit useth an enforced ceremonythere are no tricks in plain and simple faithbut hollow men like horses hot at handmake gallant show and promise of their mettlebut when they should endure the bloody spurthey fall their crests and like deceitful jadessink in the trial comes his army onthey mean this night in Sardis to be quarteredthe greater part the horse in generalare come with Cassiushark he is arrivedmarch gently on to meet himstand hostand ho speak the word alongstandstandstandmost noble brother you have done me wrongjudge me you gods Wrong I mine enemiesand if not so how should I wrong a brotherBrutus this sober form of yours hides wrongsand when you do themcassius be contentspeak your griefs softly I do know you wellbefore the eyes of both our armies herewhich should perceive nothing but love from uslet us not wrangle bid them move awaythen in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefsand I will give you audiencepindarusbid our commanders lead their charges offa little from this groundlulius do you the like and let no mancome to our tent till we have done our conferencelet Luus and Titinius guard our doorthat you have wronged me doth appear in thisyou have condemned and noted Luus Pellafor taking bribes here of the Sardianswherein my letters praying on his sidebecause I knew the man were slighted offyou wronged yourself to write in such a casein such a time as this it is not meetthat every nice offence should bear his commentlet me tell you Cassius you yourselfare much condemned to have an itching palmto sell and mart your offices for goldto undeserveraI an itching palmyou know that you are Brutus that speak thisor by the gods this speech were else your lastthe name of Cassius honours this corruptionand chastisement doth therefore hide his headchastisementremember march the ides of march rememberdid not great Julius bleed for justice sakewhat villain touched his body that did staband not for justice what shall one of usthat struck the foremost man of all this worldbut for supporting robbers shall we nowcontaminate our fingers with base bribesand sell the mighty space of our large honoursfor so much trash as may be grasped thusI had rather be a dog and bay the moonthan such a RomanBrutus bay not meiull not endure it you forget yourselfto hedge me in I am a soldier Iolder in practice abler than yourselfto make conditionsgo to you are not CassiusI amI say you are noturge me no more I shall forget myselfhave mind upon your health tempt me no furtheraway slight manis it possiblehear me for I will speakmust I give way and room to your rash cholershall I be frighted when a madman staresO ye gods ye gods Must I endure all thisall this ay more fret till your proud heart breakgo show your slaves how choleric you areand make your bondmen tremble Must I budgemust I observe you Must I stand and crouchunder your testy humour by the godsyou shall digest the venom of your spleenthough it do split you for from this day forthiull use you for my mirth yea for my laughterwhen you are waspishis it come to thisyou say you are a better soldierlet it appear so make your vaunting trueand it shall please me well for mine own partI shall be glad to learn of noble menyou wrong me every way you wrong me BrutusI said an elder soldier not a betterdid I say better if you did I care notwhen Ceasar lived he durst not thus have moved mepeace peace you durst not so have tempted himI durst notnowhat durst not tempt himfor your life you durst notdo not presume too much upon my loveI may do that I shall be sorry foryou have done that you should be sorry forthere is no terror Cassius in your threatsfor I am armed so strong in honestythat they pass by me as the idle windwhich I respect not I did send to youfor certain sums of gold which you denied mefor I can raise no money by vile meansby heaven I had rather coin my heartand drop my blood for drachmas than to wringfrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trashby any indirection I did sendto you for gold to pay my legionswhich you denied me was that done like Cassiusshould I have answered Caius Cassius sowhen Marcus Brutus grows so covetousto lock such rascal counters from his friendsbe ready gods with all your thunderboltsdash him to piecesI denied you notyou didI did not he was but a foolthat brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my hearta friend should bear his friends infirmitiesbut Brutus makes mine greater than they areI do not till you practise them on meyou love me notI do not like your faultsa friendly eye could never see such faultsa flatterers would not though they do appearas huge as high Olympuscome Antony and young Octavius comerevenge yourselves alone on Cassiusfor Cassius is aweary of the worldhated by one he loves braved by his brotherchecked like a bondman all his faults observedset in a note-book learned and conned by roteto cast into my teeth O I could weepmy spirit from mine eyes there is my daggerand here my naked breast within a heartdearer than Plutus mine richer than goldif that thou beest a Roman take it forthI that denied thee gold will give my heartstrike as thou didst at Ceasar for I knowwhen thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him betterthan ever thou lovedst Cassiussheathe your daggerbe angry when you will it shall have scopedo what you will dishonour shall be humourO Cassius you are yoked with a lambthat carries anger as the flint bears firewho much enforced shows a hasty sparkand straight is cold againhath Cassius livedto be but mirth and laughter to his Brutuswhen grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth himwhen I spoke that I was ill-tempered toodo you confess so much give me your handand my heart tooO Brutuswhats the matterhave not you love enough to bear with mewhen that rash humour which my mother gave memakes me forgetfulyes Cassius and from henceforthwhen you are over-earnest with your Brutushell think your mother chides and leave you solet me go in to see the generalsthere is some grudge between em itis not meetthey be aloneyou shall not come to themnothing but death shall stay mehow now whats the matterfor shame you generals what do you meanlove and be friends as two such men should befor I have seen more years im sure than yeha ha how vilely doth this cynic rimeget you hence sirrah saucy fellow hencebear with him Brutus itis his fashioniull know his humour when he knows his timewhat should the wars do with these jigging foolscompanion henceaway away be gonelulius and Titinius bid the commandersprepare to lodge their companies to-nightand come yourselves and bring Messala with youimmediately to usLuus a bowl of wineI did not think you could have been so angryO Cassius I am sick of many griefsof your philosophy you make no useif you give place to acdental evilsno man bears sorrow better Portia is deadha Portiashe is deadhow scaped I killing when I crossed you soO insupportable and touching lossupon what sicknessimpatient of my absenceand grief that young Octavius with mark Antonyhave made themselves so strong for with her deaththat tidings came with this she fell distractand her attendants absent swallowed fireand died soeven soO ye immortal godsspeak no more of her give me a bowl of winein this I bury all unkindness Cassiusmy heart is thirsty for that noble pledgefill Luus till the wine oerswell the cupI cannot drink too much of Brutus lovecome in Titiniuswelcome good Messalanow sit we close about this taper hereand call in question our necessitiesportia art thou goneno more I pray youmessala I have here received lettersthat young Octavius and mark Antonycome down upon us with a mighty powerbending their expedition towards PhilippImyself have letters of the self-same tenourwith what additionthat by proscription and bills of outlawryoctavius Antony and Lepidushave put to death an hundred senatorstherein our letters do not well agreemine speak of seventy senators that diedby their proscriptions cero being onecero onecero is deadand by that order of proscriptionhad you your letters from your wife my lordno Messalanor nothing in your letters writ of hernothing Messalathat methinks is strangewhy ask you Hear you aught of her in yoursno my lordnow as you are a Roman tell me truethen like a Roman bear the truth I tellfor certain she is dead and by strange mannerwhy farewell Portia we must die Messalawith meditating that she must die onceI have the patience to endure it noweven so great men great losses should endureI have as much of this in art as youbut yet my nature could not bear it sowell to our work alive what do you thinkof marching to PhilippI presentlyI do not think it goodyour reasonthis is ititis better that the enemy seek usso shall he waste his means weary his soldiersdoing himself offence whilst we lying stillare full of rest defence and nimblenessgood reasons must of force give place to betterthe people btwixt PhilippI and this grounddo stand but in a forced affectionfor they have grudged us contributionthe enemy marching along by themby them shall make a fuller number upcome on refreshed new-added and encouragedfrom which advantage shall we cut him offif at PhilippI we do face him therethese people at our backhear me good brotherunder your pardon you must note besidethat we have tried the utmost of our friendsour legions are brim-full our cause is ripethe enemy increaseth every daywe at the height are ready to declinethere is a tide in the affairs of menwhich taken at the flood leads on to fortuneomitted all the voyage of their lifeis bound in shallows and in miserieson such a full sea are we now afloatand we must take the current when it servesor lose our venturesthen with your will go onwell along ourselves and meet them at PhilippIthe deep of night is crept upon our talkand nature must obey necessitywhich we will niggard with a little restthere is no more to sayno more Good-nightearly to-morrow will we rise and henceLuusmy gownfarewell good Messalagood-night Titinius noble noble Cassiusgood-night and good reposeO my dear brotherthis was an ill

saw you any thingno my lord I saw nothingnor I my lordgo and commend me to my brother Cassiusbid him set on his powers betimes beforeand we will followit shall be done my lordit shall be done my lordnow Antony our hopes are answeredyou said the enemy would not come downbut keep the hills and upper regionsit proves not so their battles are at handthey mean to warn us at PhilippI hereanswering before we do demand of themtut I am in their bosoms and I knowwherefore they do it they could be contentto visit other places and come downwith fearful bravery thinking by this faceto fasten in our thoughts that they have couragebut itis not soprepare you generalsthe enemy comes on in gallant showtheir bloody sign of battle is hung outand something to be done immediatelyoctavius lead your battle softly onupon the left hand of the even fieldupon the right hand I keep thou the leftwhy do you cross me in this exigentI do not cross you but I will do sothey stand and would have parleystand fast Titinius we must out and talkmark Antony shall we give sign of battleno Ceasar we will answer on their chargemake forth the generals would have some wordsstir not until the signalwords before blows is it so countrymennot that we love words better as you dogood words are better than bad strokes Octaviusin your bad strokes Brutus you give good wordswitness the hole you made in Ceasars heartcrying long live hail Ceasar antonythe posture of your blows are yet unknownbut for your words they rob the Hybla beesand leave them honeylessnot stingless tooO yes and soundless toofor you have stoln their buzzing Antonyand very wisely threat before you stingvillains you did not so when your vile daggershacked one another in the sides of Ceasarhow showed your teeth like apes and fawned like houndsand bowed like bondmen kissing Ceasars feetwhilst damned Casca like a cur behindstruck Ceasar on the neck O you flatterersflatterers now Brutus thank yourselfthis tongue had not offended so to-dayif Cassius might have ruledcome come the cause if arguing make us sweatthe proof of it will turn to redder dropslookI draw a sword against conspiratorswhen think you that the sword goes up againnever till Ceasars three-and-thirty woundsbe well avenged or till another Ceasarhave added slaughter to the sword of traitorsCeasar thou canst not die by traitors handsunless thou bringest them with theeso I hopeI was not born to die on Brutus swordO if thou wert the noblest of thy strainyoung man thou couldst not die more honourablea peevish schoolboy worthless of such honourjoined with a masquer and a revellerold Cassius stillcome Antony awaydefiance traitors hurl we in your teethif you dare fight to-day come to the fieldif not when you have stomachswhy now blow wind swell billow and swim barkthe storm is up and all is on the hazardholulius hark a word with youmy lordmessalawhat says my generalmessalathis is my birth-day as this very daywas Cassius born give me thy hand Messalabe thou my witness that against my willas Pompey was am I compelled to setupon one battle all our libertiesyou know that I held Epicurus strongand his opinion now I change my mindand partly credit things that do presagecoming from Sardis on our former ensigntwo mighty eagles fell and there they perchedgorging and feeding from our soldiers handswho to PhilippI here consorted usthis morning are they fled away and goneand in their stead do ravens crows and kitesfly oer our heads and downward look on usas we were sickly prey their shadows seema canopy most fatal under whichour army lies ready to give up the ghostbelieve not soI but believe it partlyfor I am fresh of spirit and resolvedto meet all perils very constantlyeven so Luliusnow most noble Brutusthe gods to-day stand friendly that we maylovers in peace lead on our days to agebut since the affairs of men rest still incertainlets reason with the worst that may befallif we do lose this battle then is thisthe very last time we shall speak togetherwhat are you then determined to doeven by the rule of that philosophyby which I did blame Cato for the deathwhich he did give himself I know not howbut I do find it cowardly and vilefor fear of what might fall so to preventthe time of life arming myself with patienceto stay the providence of some high powersthat govern us belowthen if we lose this battleyou are contented to be led in triumphthorough the streets of Romeno Cassius no think not thou noble Romanthat ever Brutus will go bound to Romehe bears too great a mind but this same daymust end that work the ides of march begunand whether we shall meet again I know nottherefore our everlasting farewell takefor ever and for ever farewell Cassiusif we do meet again why we shall smileif not why then this parting was well madefor ever and for ever farewell Brutusif we do meet again well smile indeedif not itis true this parting was well madewhy then lead on O that a man might knowthe end of this days business ere it comebut it sufficeth that the day will endand then the end is known come ho awayride ride Messala ride and give these billsunto the legions on the other sidelet them set on at once for I perceivebut cold demeanour in Octavius wingand sudden push gives them the overthrowride ride Messala let them all come downO look Titinius look the villains flymyself have to mine own turned enemythis ensign here of mine was turning backI slew the coward and did take it from himO Cassius Brutus gave the word too earlywho having some advantage on Octaviustook it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoilwhilst we by Antony are all enclosedfly further off my lord fly further offmark Antony is in your tents my lordfly therefore noble Cassius fly far offthis hill is far enough look look Titiniusare those my tents where I perceive the firethey are my lordTitinius if thou lovest memount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in himtill he have brought thee up to yonder troopsand here again that I may rest assuredwhether yond troops are friend or enemyI will be here again even with a thoughtgo Pindarus get higher on that hillmy sight was ever thick regard Titiniusand tell me what thou notest about the fieldthis day I breathed first time is come roundand where I did begin there shall I endmy life is run his compass Sirrah what newsO my lordwhat newsTitinius is enclosed round aboutwith horsemen that make to him on the spuryet he spurs on now they are almost on himnow Titinius now some light O he lights toohes taenand hark they shout for joycome down behold no moreO coward that I am to live so longto see my best friend taen before my facecome hither sirrahin Parthia did I take thee prisonerand then I swore thee saving of thy lifethat whatsoever I did bid thee dothou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oathnow be a freeman and with this good swordthat ran through Ceasars bowels search this bosomstand not to answer here take thou the hiltsand when my face is covered as itis nowguide thou the sword Ceasar thou art revengedeven with the sword that killed theeso I am free yet would not so have beendurst I have done my will O Cassiusfar from this country Pindarus shall runwhere never Roman shall take note of himit is but change Titinius for Octaviusis overthrown by noble Brutus poweras Cassius legions are by Antonythese tidings will well comfort Cassiuswhere

their fury and make nothing ofstrives in his little world of man to out-scornthe to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rainthis night wherein the cub-drawn bear would couchthe lion and the belly-pinched wolfkeep their fur dry unbonneted he runsand bids what will take allbut who is with himnone but the fool who labours to out-jesthis heart-struck injuriessir I do know youand dare upon the warrant of my notecommend a dear thing to you there is divisionalthough as yet the face of it be coveredwith mutual cunning btwixt Albany and Cornwallwho have as who have not that their great starsthroned and set high servants who seem no lesswhich are to France the spies and speculationsintelligent of our state what hath been seeneither in snuffs and packings of the dukesor the hard rein which both of them have borneagainst the old kind king or something deeperwhereof perchance these are but furnishingsbut true it is from France there comes a powerinto this scattered kingdom who alreadywise in our negligence have secret feetin some of our best ports and are at pointto show their open banner now to youif on my credit you dare build so farto make your speed to Dover

their heelsbut the norweyan lord surveying vantagewith furbished arms and new supplies of menbegan a fresh assaultdismayed not thisour captains Macbeth and Banquoyesas sparrows eagles or the hare the lionif I say sooth I must report they wereas cannons overcharged with double cracksso theydoubly redoubled strokes upon the foeexcept they meant to bathe in reeking woundsor memorize another GolgothaI cannot tellbut I am faint my gashes cry for helpso well thy words become thee as thy woundsthey smack of honour both go get him surgeonswho comes herethe worthy thane of Rosswhat a haste looks through his eyes so should he lookthat seems to speak things strangegod save the kingwhence camest thou worthy thanefrom fife great kingwhere the norweyan banners flout the skyand fan our people cold norway himselfwith terrible numbersassisted by that most disloyal traitorthe thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflicttill that Bellonas bridegroom lapped in proofconfronted him with self-comparisonspoint against point rebellious arm gainst armcurbing his lavish spirit and to concludethe victory fell on usgreat happinessthat nowsweno the norways king craves compositionnor would we deign him burial of his mentill he disbursed at Saint Colmes Inchten thousand dollars to our general useno more that thane of Cawdor shall deceiveour bosom interest go pronounce his present deathand with his former title greet Macbethiull see it donewhat he hath lost noble Macbeth hath wonwhere hast thou been sisterkilling swinesister where thoua sailors wife had chestnuts in her lapand munched and munched and munched give me quoth Iaroint thee witch the rump-fed ronyon criesher husbands to Aleppo gone master ofthe Tigerbut in a sieve iull thither sailand like a rat without a tailiull do iull do and iull doiull give thee a windthourt kindand I anotherI myself have all the otherand the very ports they blowall the quarters that they knowinthe shipmans cardiull drain him dry as haysleep shall neither night nor dayhang upon his pent-house lidhe shall live a man forbidweary sennights nine times nineshall he dwindle peak and pinethough his bark cannot be lostyet it shall be tempest-tostlook what I haveshow me show mehere I have a pilots thumbwracked as homeward he did comea drum a drummacbeth doth comethe weird sisters hand in handposters of the sea and landthus do go about aboutthrice to thine and thrice to mineand thrice again to make up ninepeace the charms wound upso foul and fair a day I have not seenhow far is it called to forres what are theseso withered and so wild in their attirethat look not like th inhabitants ofthe earthand yet are onit Live you or are you aughtthat man may question you seem to understand meby each at once her choppy finger layingupon her skinny lips you should be womenand yet your beards forbid me to interpretthat you are sospeak if you can what are youall hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Glamisall hail Macbeth hail to thee thane of Cawdorall hail Macbeth that shalt be king hereaftergood sir why do you start and seem to fearthings that do sound so fair inthe name of truthare ye fantastical or that indeedwhich outwardly ye show my noble partneryou greet with present grace and great predictionof noble having and of royal hopethat he seems rapt withal to me you speak notif you can look into the seeds of timeand say which grain will grow and which will notspeak then to me who neither beg nor fearyour favours nor your hatelesser than Macbeth and greaternot so happy yet much happierthou shalt get kings though thou be noneso all hail Macbeth and Banquobanquo and Macbeth all hailstay you imperfect speakers tell me moreby Sinels death I know I am thane of Glamisbut how of Cawdor the thane of Cawdor livesa prosperous gentleman and to be kingstands not within the prospect of beliefno more than to be Cawdor Say from whenceyou owe this strange intelligence or whyupon this blasted heath you stop our waywith such prophetic greeting speak I charge youthe earth hath bubbles as the water hasand these are of them whither are they vanishedinto the air and what seemed corporal meltedas breath into the wind would they had stayedwere such things here as we do speak aboutor have we eaten on the insane rootthat takes the reason prisoneryour children shall be kingsyou shall be kingand thane of Cawdor too went it not soto the self-same tune and words whos herethe king hath happily received Macbeththe news of thy success and when he readsthy personal venture in the rebels fighthis wonders and his praises do contendwhich should be thine or his Silenced with thatin viewing oer the rest ofthe self-same dayhe finds thee in the stout norweyan ranksnothing afeard of what thyself didst makestrange images of death as thick as hailcame post with post and every one did bearthy praises in his kingdoms great defenceand poured them down before himwe are sentto give thee from our royal master thanksonly to herald thee into his sightnot pay theeand for an earnest of a greater honourhe bade me from him call thee thane of Cawdorin which addition hail most worthy thanefor it is thinewhat can the devil speak truethe thane of Cawdor lives why do you dress mein borrowed robeswho was the thane lives yetbut under heavy judgment bears that lifewhich he deserves to lose whether he was combinedwith those of norway or did line the rebelwith hidden help or vantage or that with bothhe laboured in his countrys wrack I know notbut treasons capital confessed and provedhave overthrown himglamis and thane of Cawdorthe greatest is behindthanks for your painsdo you not hope your children shall be kingswhen those that gave the thane of Cawdor to mepromised no less to themthat trusted homemight yet enkindle you unto the crownbesides the thane of Cawdor but itis strangeand oftentimes to win us to our harmthe instruments of darkness tell us truthswin us with honest trifles to betraysin deepest consequencecousins a word I pray youtwo truths are toldas happy prologues to the swelling actof the imperial theme I thank you gentlementhis supernatural solitingcannot be ill cannot be good if illwhy hath it given me earnest of successcommenng in a truth I am thane of Cawdorif good why do I yield to that suggestionwhose horrid image doth unfix my hairand make my seated heart knock at my ribsagainst the use of nature present fearsare less than horrible imaginingsmy thought whose murder yet is but fantasticalshakes so my single state of man that functionis smothered in surmise and nothing isbut what is notlook how our partners raptif chance will have me king why chance may crown mewithout my stirnew honours come upon himlike our strange garments cleave not to their mouldbut with the aid of usecome what come maytime and the hour runs through the roughest dayworthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisuregive me your favour my dull brain was wroughtwith things forgotten kind gentlemen your painsare registered where every day I turnthe leaf to read them let us toward the kingthink upon what hath chanced and at more timethe interim having weighed it let us speakour free hearts each to othervery gladlytill then enough come friendsis execution done on Cawdor are notthose in commission yet returnedmy liegethey are not yet come back but I have spokewith one that saw him die who did reportthat very frankly he confessed his treasonsimplored your highness pardon and set fortha deep repentance nothing in his lifebecame him like the leaving it he diedas one that had been studied in his deathto throw away the dearest thing he owedas itwere a careless trifletheres no artto find the minds construction in the facehe was a gentleman on whom I builtan absolute trustO worthiest cousinthe sin of my ingratitude even nowwas heavy on me thou art so far beforethat swiftest wing of recompense is slowto overtake thee would thou hadst less deservedthat the proportion both of thanks and paymentmight have been mine only I have left to saymore is thy due than more than all can paythe service and the loyalty I owein doing it pays itself your highness partis to receive our duties and our dutiesare to your throne and state children and servantswhich do but what they should by doing everythingsafe toward your love and honourwelcome hitherI have begun to plant thee and will labourto make thee full of growing noble Banquothat hast no less deserved nor must be knownno less to have done so let me infold theeand hold thee to my heartthere if I growthe harvest is your ownmy plenteous joyswanton in fulness seek to hide themselvesin drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanesand you whose places are the nearest knowwe will establish our estate uponour eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafterthe prince of Cumberland which honour mustnot unaccompanied invest him onlybut signs of nobleness like stars shall shineon all deservers From hence to Invernessand bind us further to youthe rest is labour which is not used for youiull be myself the harbinger and make joyfulthe hearing of my wife with your approachso humbly take my leavemy worthy Cawdorthe prince of Cumberland that is a stepon which I must fall down or else oer-leapfor in my way it lies Stars hide your fireslet not light see my black and deep desiresthe eye wink at the hand yet let that bewhich the eye fears when it is done to seetrue worthy Banquo he is full so valiantand in his commendations I am fedit is a banquet to me lets after himwhose care is gone before to bid us welcomeit is a peerless kinsmanthey met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge when I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who all-hailed me thane of Cawdor by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with Hail king that shall be this have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightest not lose the dues of rejoing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart and farewellglamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt bewhat thou art promised yet do I fear thy natureit is too full ofthe milk of human kindnessto catch the nearest way thou wouldst be greatart not without ambition but withoutthe illness should attend it what thou wouldst highlythat thou wouldst holily wouldst not play falseand yet wouldst wrongly win thouedst have great Glamisthat which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to dothan wishest should be undone chide thee hitherthat I may pour my spirits in thine earand chastise with the valour of my tongueall that impedes thee from the golden roundwhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seemto have thee crowned withalwhat is your tidingsthe king comes here to-nightthourt mad to say itis not thy master with him who wereit sowould have informed for preparationso please you it is true our thane is comingone of my fellows had the speed of himwho almost dead for breath had scarcely morethan would make up his messagegive him tendinghe brings great newsthe raven himself is hoarsethat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncanunder my battlements come you spiritsthat tend on mortal thoughts unsex me hereand fill me from the crown to the toe top fullof direst cruelty make thick my bloodstop up the access and passage to remorsethat no compunctious visitings of natureshake my fell purpose nor keep peace betweenthe effect and it come to my womans breastsand take my milk for gall you murdering ministerswherever in your sightless substancesyou wait on natures mischief come thick nightand pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hellthat my keen knife see not the wound it makesnor heaven peep through the blanket of the darkto cry hold hold great Glamis worthy Cawdorgreater than both by the all-hail hereafterthy letters have transported me beyondthis ignorant present and I feel nowthe future in the instantmy dearest loveduncan comes here to-nightand when goes henceto-morrow as he purposesO nevershall sun that morrow seeyour face my thane is as a book where menmay read strange matters to beguile the timelook like the time bear welcome in your eyeyour hand your tongue look like the innocent flowerbut be the serpent undert he thats comingmust be provided for and you shall putthis nights great business into my dispatchwhich shall to all our nights and days to comegive solely sovereign sway and masterdomwe will speak furtheronly look up clearto alter favour ever is to fearleave all the rest to methis castle hath a pleasant seat the airnimbly and sweetly recommends itselfunto our gentle sensesthis guest of summerthe temple-haunting martlet does approveby his loved mansionry that the heavens breathsmells wooingly here no jutty friezebuttress nor coign of vantage but this birdhath made his pendent bed and procreant cradlewhere they most breed and haunt I have observedthe air is delicatesee see our honoured hostessthe love that follows us sometime is our troublewhich still we thank as love Herein I teach youhow you shall bid God eyld us for your painsand thank us for your troubleall our servicein every point twice done and then done doublewere poor and single business to contendagainst those honours deep and broad wherewithyour majesty loads our house for those of oldand the late dignities heaped up to themwe rest your hermitswheres the thane of Cawdorwe coursed him at the heels and had a purposeto be his purveyor but he rides welland his great love sharp as his spur hath holp himto his home before us fair and noble hostesswe are your guest to-nightyour servants everhave theirs themselves and what is theirs in comptto make their audit at your highness pleasurestill to return your owngive me your handconduct me to mine host we love him highlyand shall continue our graces towards himby your leave hostessif it were done when itis done then itwere wellit were done quickly if the assassinationcould trammel up the consequence and catchwith his surcease success that but this blowmight be the be-all and the end-all herebut here upon this bank and shoal of timeweed jump the life to come but in these caseswe still have judgment here that we but teachbloody instructions which being taught returnto plague the inventor this even-handed justicecommends the ingredients of our poisoned chaliceto our own lips Hes here in double trustfirst as I am his kinsman and his subjectstrong both against the deed then as his hostwho should against his murderer shut the doornot bear the knife myself besides this Duncanhath borne his faculties so meek hath beenso clear in his great office that his virtueswill plead like angels trumpet-tongued againstthe deep damnation of his taking-offand pity like a naked new-born babestriding the blast or heavens cherubin horsedupon the sightless couriers of the airshall blow the horrid deed in every eyethat tears shall drown the wind I have no spurto prick the sides of my intent but onlyvaulting ambition which oer-leaps itselfand falls on the otherhow now what newshe has almost supped why have you left the chamberhath he asked for meknow you not he haswe will proceed no further in this businesshe hath honoured me of late and I have boughtgolden opinions from all sorts of peoplewhich would be worn now in their newest glossnot cast aside so soonwas the hope drunkwherein you dressed yourself hath it slept sinceand wakes it now to look so green and paleat what it did so freely From this timesuch I account thy love art thou afeardto be the same in thine own act and valouras thou art in desire wouldst thou have thatwhich thou esteemest the ornament of lifeand live a coward in thine own esteemletting I dare not wait upon I would like the poor cat inthe adageprithee peaceI dare do all that may become a manwho dares do more is nonewhat beast wast thenthat made you break this enterprise to mewhen you durst do it then you were a manand to be more than what you were you wouldbe so much more the man nor time nor placedid then adhere and yet you would make boththey have made themselves and that their fitness nowdoes unmake you I have given suck and knowhow tender itis to love the babe that milks meI would while it was smiling in my facehave plucked my nipple from his boneless gumsand dashed the brains out had I so sworn as youhave done to thisif we should failwe failbut screw your courage to the sticking-placeand well not fail when Duncan is asleepwhereto the rather shall his days hard journeysoundly invite him his two chamberlainswill I with wine and wassail so convincethat memory the warder of the brainshall be a fume and the receipt of reasona limbeck only when in swinish sleeptheir drenched natures lie as in a deathwhat cannot you and I perform uponthe unguarded Duncan what not put uponhis spongy officers who shall bear the guiltof our great quellbring forth men-children onlyfor thy undaunted mettle should composenothing but males Will it not be receivedwhen we have marked with blood those sleepy twoof his own chamber and used their very daggersthat they have donetwho dares receive it otheras we shall make our griefs and clamour roarupon his deathI am settled and bend upeach corporal agent to this terrible feataway and mock the time with fairest showfalse face must hide what the false heart doth knowhow goes the night boythe moon is down I have not heard the clockand she goes down at twelveI taket itis later sirhold take my sword theres husbandry in heaventheir candles are all out take thee that tooa heavy summons lies like lead upon meand yet I would not sleep merful powersrestrain in me the cursed thoughts that naturegives way to in reposegive me my swordwhos therea friendwhat sir not yet at rest the kings a-bedhe hath been in unusual pleasure andsent forth great largess to your officesthis diamond he greets your wife withalby the name of most kind hostess and shut upin measureless contentbeing unpreparedour will became the servant to defectwhich else should free have wroughtalls wellI dreamt last night of the three weird sistersto you they have showed some truthI think not of themyet when we can entreat an hour to servewe would spend it in some words upon that businessif you would grant the timeat your kindest leisureif you shall cleave to my consent when itisit shall make honour for youso I lose nonein seeking to augment it but still keepmy bosom franchised and allegiance clearI shall be counselledgood repose the whilethanks sir the like to yougo bid thy mistress when my drink is readyshe strike upon the bell get thee to bedis this a dagger which I see before methe handle toward my hand come let me clutch theeI have thee not and yet I see thee stillart thou not fatal vision sensibleto feeling as to sight or art thou buta dagger of the mind a false creationproceeding from the heat-oppressed brainI see thee yet in form as palpableas this which now I drawthou marshallest me the way that I was goingand such an instrument I was to usemine eyes are made the fools ofthe other sensesor else worth all the rest I see thee stilland on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of bloodwhich was not so before theres no such thingit is the bloody business which informsthus to mine eyes now oer the one half-worldnature seems dead and wicked dreams abusethe curtained sleep witchcraft celebratespale Hecates offerings and withered murderalarmed by his sentinel the wolfwhose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pacewith Tarquins ravishing strides toward his designmoves like a ghost thou sure and firm-set earthhear not my steps which way they walk for fearthy very stones prate of my whereaboutand take the present horror from the timewhich now suits with it whiles I threat he liveswords to the heat of deeds too cold breath givesI go and it is done the bell invites mehear it not Duncan for it is a knellthat summons thee to heaven or to hellthat which hath made them drunk hath made me boldwhat hath quenched them hath given me fire harkpeaceit was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellmanwhich gives the sternest good-night he is about itthe doors are open and the surfeited groomsdo mock their charge with snores I have drugged their possetsthat death and nature do contend about themwhether they live or diewhos there what hoalack I am afraid they have awakedand itis not done the attempt and not the deedconfounds us hark I laid their daggers readyhe could not miss them Had he not resembledmy father as he slept I had done'tmy husbandI have done the deed didst thou not hear a noiseI heard the owl scream and the crickets crydid not you speakwhennowas I descendedayharkwho lies inthe second chamberdonalbainthis is a sorry sighta foolish thought to say a sorry sighttheres one did laugh in s sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other I stood and heard thembut they did say their prayers and addressed themagain to sleepthere are two lodged togetherone cried God bless us and amen the otheras they had seen me with these hangmans handslistening their fear I could not say amen when they did say God bless us consider it not so deeplybut wherefore could not I pronounce amen I had most need of blessing and amenstuck in my throatthese deeds must not be thoughtafter these ways so it will make us madmethought I heard a voice cry Sleep no moremacbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleepsleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of carethe death of each days life sore labours bathbalm of hurt minds great natures second coursechief nourisher in lifes feastwhat do you meanstill it cried Sleep no more to all the houseglamis hath murdered sleep and therefore Cawdorshall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more who was it that thus cried why worthy thaneyou do unbend your noble strength to thinkso brainsickly of things go get some waterand wash this filthy witness from your handwhy did you bring these daggers from the placethey must lie there go carry them and smearthe sleepy grooms with bloodiull go no moreI am afraid to think what I have donelook onit again I dare notinfirm of purposegive me the daggers the sleeping and the deadare but as pictures itis the eye of childhoodthat fears a painted devil if he do bleediull gild the faces of the grooms withalfor it must seem their guiltwhence is that knockinghow isit with me when every noise appals mewhat hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyeswill all great Neptunes ocean wash this bloodclean from my hand no this my hand will ratherthe multitudinous seas incarnadinemaking the green one redmy hands are of your colour but I shameto wear a heart so whiteI hear a knockingat the south entry retire we to our chambera little water clears us of this deedhow easy is it then your constancyhath left you unattendedhark more knockingget on your night-gown lest occasion call usand show us to be watchers be not lostso poorly in your thoughtsto

sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves himI believe drink gave thee the lie last nightthat it did sir inthe very throat o me but I requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast

thus our fears in Banquostick deep and in his royalty of naturereigns that which would be feared itis much he daresand to that dauntless temper of his mindhe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valourto act in safety there is none but hewhose being I do fear and under himmy genius is rebuked as it is saidmark Antonys was by Ceasar he chid the sisterswhen first they put the name of king upon meand bade them speak to him then prophet-likethey hailed him father to a line of kingsupon my head they placed a fruitless crownand put a barren sceptre in my gripethence to be wrenched with an unlineal handno son of mine succeeding if'tbe sofor Banquos issue have I filed my mindfor them the gracious Duncan have I murderedput rancours in the vessel of my peaceonly for them and mine eternal jewelgiven to the common enemy of manto make them kings the seed of Banquo kingsrather than so come fate into the listand champion me to the utterance whos therenow go to the door and stay there till we callwas it not yesterday we spoke togetherit was so please your highnesswell then nowhave you considered of my speeches knowthat it was he in the times past which held

wrought with them and all things else that mightto half a soul and to a notion crazedsay thus did Banquo you made it known to usI did so and went further which is nowour point of second meeting do you findyour patience so predominant in your naturethat you can let this go are you so gospelledto pray for this good man and for his issuewhose heavy hand hath bowed you to the graveand beggared yours for everwe are men my liegeay in the catalogue ye go for menas hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels cursshoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are cleptall by the name of dogs the valued filedistinguishes the swift the slow the subtlethe housekeeper the hunter every oneaccording to the gift which bounteous naturehath in him closed whereby he does receiveparticular addition from the billthat writes them all alike and so of mennow if you have a station in the filenot inthe worst rank of manhood say itand I will put that business in your bosomswhose execution takes your enemy offgrapples you to the heart and love of uswho wear our health but sickly in his lifewhich in his death were perfectI am one my liegewhom the vile blows and buffets of the worldhave so incensed that I am reckless whatI do to spite the worldand I anotherso weary with disasters tugged with fortunethat I would set my life on any chanceto mend it or be rid onitboth of youknow Banquo was your enemytrue my lordso is he mine and in such bloody distancethat every minute of his being thrustsagainst my nearest of life and though I couldwith bare-faced power sweep him from my sightand bid my will avouch it yet I must notfor certain friends that are both his and minewhose loves I may not drop but wail his fallwhom I myself struck down and thence it isthat I to your assistance do make lovemasking the business from the common eyefor sundry weighty reasonswe shall my lordperform what you command usthough our livesyour spirits shine through you Within this hour at mostI will advise you where to plant yourselvesacquaint you with the perfect spy ofthe timethe moment onit forit must be done to-nightand something from the palace always thoughtthat I

without contentitis safer to be that which we destroythan by destruction dwell in doubtful joyhow now my lord why do you keep aloneof sorriest fanes your companions makingusing those thoughts which should indeed have diedwith them they think on Things without all remedyshould be without regard whats done is donewe have scotched the snake not killed itshell close and be herself whilst our poor maliceremains in danger of her former toothbut let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds sufferere we will eat our meal in fear and sleepin the affliction of these terrible dreamsthat shake us nightly better be with the deadwhom we to gain our peace have sent to peacethan on the torture of the mind to liein restless ecstasy Duncan is in his graveafter lifes fitful fever he sleeps welltreason has done his worst nor steel nor poisonmalice domestic foreign levy nothingcan touch him furthercome ongentle my lord sleek oer your rugged looksbe bright and jovial among your guests to-nightso shall I love and so I pray be youlet your remembrance apply to Banquopresent him eminence both with eye and tongueunsafe the while that wemust lave our honours in

thing besideI am for the air this night iull spendunto a dismal and a fatal endgreat business must be wrought ere noonupon the corner of the moonthere hangs a vaporous drop profoundiull catch it ere it come to groundand that distilled by magic sleightsshall raise such artifial spritesas by the strength of their illusionshall draw him on to his confusionhe shall spurn fate scorn death and bearhis hopes bove wisdom grace and fearand you all know securityis mortals chiefest enemyhark I am called my little spirit seesits in a foggy cloud and stays for mecome lets make haste shell soon be back againmy former speeches have but hit your thoughtswhich can interpret further only I saythings have been strangely borne the gracious Duncanwas pitied of Macbeth marry he was deadand the right-valiant Banquo walked too latewhom you may say if'tplease you Fleance killedfor Fleance fled men must not walk too latewho cannot want the thought how monstrousit was for Malcolm and for Donalbainto kill their gracious father damned facthow it did grieve Macbeth did he not straightin pious rage the two delinquents tearthat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleepwas not that nobly done Ay and wisely tooforitwould have angered any heart aliveto hear the men deny'tSo that I sayhe has borne all things well and I do thinkthat had he Duncans sons under his keyas an'tplease heaven he shall not they should findwhat itwere to kill a father so should Fleancebut peace for from broad words and cause he failedhis presence at the tyrants feast I hearmacduff lives in disgrace sir can you tellwhere he bestows himselfthe son of Duncanfrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birthlives in the English court and is receivedof the most pious Edward with such gracethat the malevolence of fortune nothingtakes from his high respect Thither Macduffis gone to pray the holy king upon his aidto wake northumberland and war-like Siwardthat by the help of these with him aboveto ratify the work we may againgive to our tables meat sleep to our nightsfree from our feasts and banquets bloody knivesdo faithful homage and receive free honoursall which we pine for now and this reporthath so exasperate the king that heprepares for some attempt at warsent he to Macduffhe did and with an absolute sir not I the cloudy messenger turns me his backand hums as who should say youll rue the timethat clogs me with this answer and that well mightadvise him to a caution to hold what distancehis wisdom can provide Some holy angelfly to the court of England and unfoldhis message ere he come that a swift blessingmay soon return to this our suffering countryunder a hand accursediull send my prayers with himthrice the brinded cat hath

madamhe had nonehis flight was madness when our actions do notour fears do make us traitorsyou know notwhether it was his wisdom or his fearwisdom to leave his wife to leave his babeshis mansion and his titles in a placefrom whence himself does fly he loves us nothe wants the natural touch for the poor wrenthe most diminutive of birds will fighther young ones in her nest against the owlall is the fear and nothing is the loveas little is the wisdom where the flightso runs against all reasonmy dearest cozI pray you school yourself but for your husbandhe is noble wise judious and best knowsthe fits ofthe season I dare not speak much furtherbut cruel are the times when we are traitorsand do not know ourselves when we hold rumourfrom what we fear yet know not what we fearbut float upon a wild and violent seaeach way and move I take my leave of youshall not be long but iull be here againthings at the worst will cease or else climb upwardto what they were before my pretty cousinblessing upon youfathered he is and yet hes fatherlessI am so much a fool should I stay longerit would be my disgrace and your discomfortI take my leave at oncesirrah your fathers deadand what will you do now how will you liveas birds do motherwhat with worms and flieswith what I get I mean and so do theypoor bird thouedst never fear the net nor limethe pit-fall nor the ginwhy should I mother poor birds they are not set formy father is not dead for all your sayingyes he is dead how wilt thou do for a fathernay how will you do for a husbandwhy I can buy me twenty at any marketthen youll buy em to sell againthou speakest with all thy wit and yet infaithwith wit enough for theewas my father a traitor motheray that he waswhat is a traitorwhy one that swears and liesand be all traitors that do soevery one that does so is a traitor and must be hangedand must they all be hanged that swear and lieevery onewho must hang themwhy the honest menthen the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up themnow God help thee poor monkeybut how wilt thou do for a fatherif he were dead youed weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new fatherpoor prattler how thou talkestbless you fair dame I am not to you knownthough in your state of honour I am perfectI doubt some danger does approach you nearlyif you will take a homely mans advicebe not found here hence with your little onesto fright you thus methinks I am too savageto do worse to you were fell crueltywhich is too nigh your person Heaven preserve youI dare abide no longerwhither should I flyI have done no harm but I remember nowI am in this earthly world where to do harmis often laudable to do good sometimeaccounted dangerous folly why then alasdo I put up that womanly defenceto say I have done no harmwhat are these faceswhere is your husbandI hope in no place so unsanctifiedwhere such as thou mayst find himhes a traitorthou liest thou shag-haired villainwhat you eggyoung fry of treacheryhe has killed me motherrun away I pray youlet us seek out some desolate shade and thereweep our sad bosoms emptylet us ratherhold fast the mortal sword and like good menbestride our down-falln birthdom each new mornnew widowshowl new orphans cry new sorrowsstrike heaven on the face that it resoundsas if it felt with Scotland and yelled outlike syllable of dolourwhat I believe iull wailwhat know believe and what I can redressas I shall find the time to friend I willwhat you have spoke it may be so perchancethis tyrant whosesole name blisters our tongueswas once thought honest you have loved him wellhe hath not touched you yet I am young but somethingyou may deserve of him through me and wisdomto offer up a weak poor innocent lambto appease an angry godI am not treacherousbut Macbeth isa good and virtuous nature may recoilin an imperial charge but I shall crave your pardonthat which you are my thoughts cannot transposeangels are bright still though the brightest fellthough all things foul would wear the brows of graceyet grace must still look soI have lost my hopesperchance even there where I did find my doubtswhy in that rawness left you wife and childthose precious motives those strong knots of lovewithout leave-taking I pray youlet not my jealousies be your dishonoursbut mine own safeties you may be rightly justwhatever I shall thinkbleed bleed poor countrygreat tyranny lay thou thy basis surefor goodness dares not check thee wear thou thy wrongsthe title is affeered fare thee well lordI would not be the villain that thou thinkestfor the whole space thats in the tyrants graspand the rich East to bootbe not offendedI speak not as in absolute fear of youI think our country sinks beneath the yokeit weeps it bleeds and each new day a gashis added to her wounds I think withalthere would be hands uplifted in my rightand here from gracious England have I offerof goodly thousands but for all thiswhen I shall tread upon the tyrants heador wear it on my sword yet my poor countryshall have more vices than it had beforemore suffer and more sundry ways than everby him that shall succeedwhat should he beit is myself I mean in whom I knowall the particulars of vice so graftedthat when they shall be opened black Macbethwill seem as pure as snow and the poor stateesteem him as a lamb being comparedwith my confineless harmsnot in the legionsof horrid hell can come a devil more damnedin evils to top MacbethI grant him bloodyluxurious avarious false deceitfulsudden malious smacking of every sinthat has a name but theres no bottom nonein my voluptuousness your wives your daughtersyour matrons and your maids could not fill upthe stern of my lust and my desireall continent impediments would oerbearthat did oppose my will better Macbeththan such an one to reignboundless intemperancein nature is a tyranny it hath beenth untimely emptying of the happy throneand fall of many kings but fear not yetto take upon you what is yours you mayconvey your pleasures in a spaous plentyand yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwinkwe have willing dames enough there cannot bethat vulture in you to devour so manyas will to greatness dedicate themselvesfinding it so inclinedwith this there growsin my most ill-composed affection sucha stanchless avarice that were I kingI should cut off the nobles for their landsdesire his jewels and this others houseand my more-having would be as a sauceto make me hunger more that I should forgequarrels unjust against the good and loyaldestroying them for wealththis avaricesticks deeper grows with more pernious rootthan summer-seeming lust and it hath beenthe sword of our slain kings yet do not fearscotland hath foisons to fill up your willof your mere own all these are portablewith other graces weighedbut I have none the king-becomingracesas justice verity temperance stablenessbounty perseverance mercy lowlinessdevotion patience courage fortitudeI have no relish of them but aboundin the division of each several crimeacting it many ways nay had I power I shouldpour the sweet milk of concord into helluproar the universal peace confoundall unity on earthO Scotland Scotlandif such a one be fit to govern speakI am as I have spokenfit to governno not to live O nation miserablewith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepteredwhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days againsince that the truest issue of thy throneby his own interdiction stands accursedand does blaspheme his breed thy royal fatherwas a most sainted king the queen that bore theeoftner upon her knees than on her feetdied every day she lived fare thee wellthese evils thou repeatest upon thyselfhave banished me from Scotland O my breastthy hope ends heremacduff this noble passionchild of integrity hath from my soulwiped the black scruples reconled my thoughtsto thy good truth and honour Devilish Macbethby many of these trains hath sought to win meinto his power and modest wisdom plucks mefrom over-credulous haste but God abovedeal between thee and me for even nowI put myself to thy direction andunspeak mine own detraction here abjurethe taints and blames I laid upon myselffor strangers to my nature I am yetunknown to woman never was forswornscarcely have coveted what was mine ownat no time broke my faith would not betraythe devil to his fellow and delightno less in truth than life my first false speakingwas this upon myself what I am trulyis thine and my poor countrys to commandwhither indeed before thy here-approachold Siward with ten thousand war-like menalready at a point was setting forthnow well together and the chance of goodnessbe like our warranted quarrel why are you silentsuch welcome and unwelcome things at onceitis hard to reconlewell more anon comes the king forth I pray youay sir there are a crew of wretched soulsthat stay his cure their malady convincesthe great assay of art but at his touchsuch sanctity hath heaven given his handthey presently amendI thank you doctorwhats the disease he meansitis called the evila most miraculous work in this good kingwhich often since my here-remain in EnglandI have seen him do how he solits heavenhimself best knows but strangely-visited peopleall swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eyethe mere despair of surgery he cureshanging a golden stamp about their necksput on with holy prayers and itis spokento the succeeding royalty he leavesthe healing benediction With this strange

throw her night-gown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write uponit read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleepa great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching in this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her saythat

way of lifeis falln into the sear the yellow leafand that which should accompany old ageas honour love obedience troops of friendsI must not look to have but in their steadcurses not loud but

bones my flesh be hackedgive me my armouritis not needed yetiull put it onsend out more horses skirr the country roundhang those that talk of fear give me mine armourhow does your patient doctornot so sick my lordas she is troubled with thick-coming fanesthat keep her from her restcure her of thatcanst thou not minister to a mind diseasedpluck from the memory a rooted sorrowraze out the written troubles of the brainand with some sweet oblivious antidotecleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuffwhich weighs upon the hearttherein the patientmust minister to himselfthrow physic to the dogs iull none of itcome put mine armour on give me my staffseyton send out Doctor the thanes fly from mecome sir dispatch if thou couldst doctor castthe water of my land find her diseaseand purge it to a sound and pristine healthI would applaud thee to the very echothat should applaud againpull'toff I saywhat rhubarb senna or what purgative drugwould scour these English hence Hearest thou of themay my good lord your royal preparationmakes us hear somethingbring it after meI will not be afraid of death and banetill Birnam forest come to Dunsinanewere I from Dunsinane away and clearprofit again should hardly draw me herecousins I hope the days are near at handthat chambers will be safewe doubt it nothingwhat wood is this before usthe wood of Birnamlet every soldier hew him down a boughand bear'tbefore him thereby shall we shadowthe numbers of our host and make discoveryerr in report of usit shall be donewe learn no other but the confident tyrantkeeps still in Dunsinane and will endureour setting down before titis his main hopefor where there is advantage to be givenboth more and less have given him the revoltand none serve with him but constrained thingswhose hearts are absent toolet our just censuresattend the true event and put we onindustrious soldiershipthe time approachesthat will with due desion make us knowwhat we shall say we have and what we owethoughts speculative their unsure hopes relatebut certain issue strokes must arbitratetowards which advance the warhang out our banners on the outward wallsthe cry is still they come our castles strengthwill laugh a siege to scorn here let them lietill famine and the ague eat them upwere they not forced with those that should be ourswe might have met them dareful beard to beardand beat them backward homewhat is that noiseit is the cry of women my good lordI have almost forgot the taste of fearsthe time has been my senses would have cooledto hear a night-shriek and my fell of hairwould at a dismal treatise rouse and stiras life were init I have supped full with horrorsdireness familiar to my slaughterous thoughtscannot once start mewherefore was that crythe queen my lord is deadshe should have died hereafterthere would have been a time for such a wordto-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrowcreeps in this petty pace from day to dayto the last syllable of recorded timeand all our yesterdays have lighted foolsthe way to dusty death out out brief candlelifes but a walking shadow a poor playerthat struts and frets his hour upon the stageand then is heard no more it is a taletold by an idiot full of sound and furysignifying nothingthou comest to use thy tongue thy story quicklygracious my lordI should report that which I say I sawbut know not how to do itwell say siras I did stand my watch upon the hillI looked towards Birnam and anon methoughtthe wood began to moveliar and slavelet me endure your wrath ift be not sowithin this three mile may you see it comingI say a moving groveif thou speakest falseupon the next tree shalt thou hang alivetill famine cling thee if thy speech be soothI care not if thou dost for me as muchI pull in resolution and beginto doubt the equivocation of the fiendthat lies like truth fear not till Birnam wooddo come to Dunsinane and now a woodcomes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and outif this which he avouches does appearthere is nor flying hence nor tarrying hereigrown to be aweary of the sunand wish the estate ofthe world were now undonering the alarum-bell blow wind come wrackat least well die with harness on our backnow near enough your leavy screens throw downand show like those you are you worthy uncleshall with my cousin your right-noble sonlead our first battle worthy Macduff and weshall take upon s what else remains to doaccording to our orderfare you welldo we but find the tyrants power to-nightlet us be beaten if we cannot fightmake all our trumpets speak give them all breaththose clamorous harbingers of blood and deaththey have tied me to a stake I cannot flybut bear-like I must fight the course whats hethat was not born of woman such a oneam I to fear or nonewhat is thy namethoult be afraid to hear itno though thou callest thyself a hotter namethan any is in hellmy names Macbeththe devil himself could not pronounce a titlemore hateful to mine earno nor more fearfulthou liest abhorred tyrant with my swordiull prove the lie thou speakestthou wast born of womanbut swords I smile at weapons laugh to scornbrandished by man thats of a woman bornthat way the noise is tyrant< show thy faceif thou beest slain and with no stroke of minemy wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me stillI cannot strike at wretched kerns whose armsare hired to bear their staves either thou Macbethor else my sword with an unbattered edgeI sheathe again undeeded there thou shouldst beby this great clatter one of greatest noteseems bruited let me find him fortuneand more I beg notthis way my lord the castles gently renderedthe tyrants people on both sides do fightthe noble thanes do bravely in the warthe day almost itself professes yoursand little is to dowe have met with foesthat strike beside usenter sir the castlewhy should I play the Roman fool and dieon mine own sword whiles I see lives the gashesdo better upon themturn hell-hound turnof all men else I have avoided theebut get thee back my soul is too much chargedwith blood of thine alreadyI have no wordsmy voice is in my sword thou bloodier villainthan terms can give thee outthou losest labouras easy mayst thou the intrenchant airwith thy keen sword impress as make me bleedlet fall thy blade on vulnerable crestsI bear a charmed life which must not yieldto one of woman borndespair thy charmand let the angel whom thou still hast servedtell thee Macduff was from his mothers wombuntimely rippedaccursed be that tongue that tells me sofor it hath cowed my better part of manand be these juggling fiends no more believedthat palter with us in a double sensethat keep the word of promise to our earand break it to our hope iull not fight with theethen yield thee cowardand live to be the show and gaze ofthe timewell have thee as our rarer monsters arepainted upon a pole and underwrithere may you see the tyrant I will not yieldto kiss the ground before young Malcolms feetand to be baited with the rabbles cursethough Birnam wood be come to Dunsinaneand thou opposed being of no woman bornyet I will try the last before my bodyI throw my war-like shield Lay on Macduffand damned be him that first cries hold enough I would the friends we miss were safe arrivedsome must go off and yet by these I seeso great a day as this is cheaply boughtmacduff is missing and your noble sonyour son my lord has paid a soldiers debthe only lived but till he was a manthe which no sooner had his prowess confirmedin the unshrinking station where he foughtbut like a man he diedthen he is deaday and brought off the field your cause of sorrowmust not be measured by his worth for thenit hath no endhad he his hurts beforeay on the frontwhy then Gods soldier be hehad I as many sons as I have hairsI would not wish them to a fairer deathand so his knell is knolledhes worth more sorrowand that iull spend for himhes worth no morethey say he parted well and paid his scoreand so God be with him here comes newer comforthail king for so thou art behold where standsthe usurpers cursed head the time is freeI see thee compassed with thy kingdoms pearlthat speak my salutation in their mindswhose voices I desire aloud with minehail king of Scotlandwe shall not spend a large expense of timebefore we reckon with your several lovesand make useven with you my thanes and kinsmenhenceforth be earls the first that ever Scotlandin such an honour named whats more to dowhich would be planted newly with the timeas calling home our exiled friends abroadthat fled the snares of watchful tyrannyprodung forth the cruel ministersof this dead butcher and his fiend-like queenwho as itis thought by self and violent handstook off her life this and what needful elsethat calls upon us by the grace of gracewe will perform in measure time and placeso thanks to all at once and to each onewhom we invite to see us crowned at Sconetush never tell me I take it much unkindlythat thou Iago who hast had my purseas if the strings were thine shouldst know of thissblood but you will not hear meif ever I did dream of such a matterabhor methou toldest me thou didst hold him in thy hatedespise me if I do not Three great ones of the tyin personal suit to make me his lieutenantoff-capped to him and by the faith of manI know my price I am worth no worse a placebut he as loving his own pride and purposesevades them with a bombast rcumstancehorribly stuffed with epithets of warand in conclusionnonsuits my mediators for Certes says heI have already chose my officer and what was heforsooth a great arithmetianone Michael Cassio a Florentinea fellow almost damned in a fair wifethat never set a squadron in the fieldnor the division of a battle knowsmore than a spinster unless the bookish theoricwherein the toged consuls can proposeas masterly as he mere prattle without practiceis all his soldiership but he sir had the electionand I of whom his eyes had seen the proofat Rhodes at Cyprus and on other groundschristian and heathen must be be-leeed and calmedby debitor and creditor this counter casterhe in good time must his lieutenant beand I God bless the mark his Moorships anentby heaven I rather would have been his hangmanwhy theres no remedy itis the curse of the servicepreferment goes by letter and affectionnot by the old gradation where each secondstood heir to the first now sir be judge yourselfwher I in any just term am affinedto love the MoorI would not follow him thenO sir content youI follow him to serve my turn upon himwe cannot all be masters nor all masterscannot be truly followed you shall markmany a duteous and knee-crooking knavethat doting on his own obsequious bondagewears out his time much like his masters assfor nought but provender and when hes old cashieredwhip me such honest knaves others there arewho trimmed in forms and visages of dutykeep yet their hearts attending on themselvesand throwing but shows of service on their lordsdo well thrive by them and when they have lined their coatsdo themselves homage these fellows have some souland such a one do I profess myself for sirit is as sure as you are Roderigowere I the Moor I would not be Iagoin following him I follow but myselfheaven is my judge not I for love and dutybut seeming so for my peculiar endfor when my outward action doth demonstratethe native act and figure of my heartin compliment extern itis not long afterbut I will wear my heart upon my sleevefor daws to peck at I am not what I amwhat a full fortune does the thick-lips oweif he can carry'tthuscall up her fatherrouse him make after him poison his delightproclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmenand though he in a fertile climate dwellplague him with flies though that his joy be joyyet throw such changes of vexation onitas it may lose some colourhere is her fathers house iull call alouddo

thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigosir I will answer any thing but I beseech youif'tbe your pleasure and most wise consentas partly I find it is that your fair daughterat this odd-even and dull-watch ofthe nighttransported with no worse nor better guardbut with a knave of common hire a gondolierto the gross clasps of a lasvious Moorif this be known to you and your allowancewe then

the Moor for I do know the statehowever this may gall him with some checkcannot with safety cast him for hes embarkedwith such loud reason to the Cyprus warswhich even now stand in act that for their soulsanother of his fathom they have noneto lead their business in which regardthough I do hate him as I do hell-painsyet for necessity of present lifeI must show out a flag and sign of lovewhich is indeed but sign that you shall surely find himlead to the Sagittary the raised searchand there will I be with him so farewellit is too true an evil gone she isand whats to come of my despised timeis nought but bitterness now Roderigowhere didst thou see her O unhappy girlwith the Moor sayst thou who would be a fatherhow didst thou know itwas she O she deceives mepast thought what said she to you get more tapersraise all my kindred are they married think youtruly I think they areO heaven how got she out O treason of the bloodfathers from hence trust not your daughters

very stuff ofthe consenceto do no contrived murder I lack iniquitysometimes to do me service nine or ten timesI had thought to have yerked him here under the ribsitis better as it isnay but he pratedand spoke such scurvy and provoking termsagainst your honourthat with the little godliness I haveI did full hard forbear him but I pray sirare you fast married be assured of thisthat the magnifico is much belovedand hath in his effect a voice potentialas double as the dukes he will divorce youor put upon you what restraint and grievancethe law with all his might to enforce it onwill give him cablelet him do his spitemy services which I have done the signioryshall out-tongue his complaints itis yet to knowwhich when I know that boasting is an honourI shall promulgate I fetch my life and beingfrom men of royal siege and my demeritsmay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortuneas this that I have reached for know Iagobut that I love the gentle DesdemonaI would not my unhoused free conditionput into rcumscription and confinefor the seas worth but look what lights come yondthose are the raised father and his friendsyou were best go innot I I must be foundmy parts my title and my perfect soulshall manifest me rightly is it theyby Janus I think nothe servants of the duke and my lieutenantthe goodness of the night upon you friendswhat is the newsthe duke does greet you generaland he requires your haste-post-haste appearanceeven on the instantwhat is the matter think yousomething from Cyprus as I may divineit is a business of some heat the galleyshave sent a dozen sequent messengersthis very night at one anothers heelsand many of the consuls raised and metare at the dukes already you have been hotly called forwhen being not at your lodging to be foundthe senate hath sent about three several queststo search you outitis well I am found by youI will but spend a word here in the houseand go with youanent what makes he herefaith he to-night hath boarded a land carrackif it prove lawful prize hes made for everI do not understandhes marriedto whomarry to come captain will you gohave with youhere comes another

swords for the dew will rust themgood signior you shall more command with yearsthan with your weaponsO thou foul thief where hast thou stowed my daughterdamned as thou art thou hast enchanted herfor iull refer me to all things of senseif she in chains of magic were not boundwhether a maid so tender fair and happyso opposite to marriage that she shunnedthe wealthy curled darlings of our nationwould ever have to incur a general mockrun from her guardage to the sooty bosomof such a thing as thou to fear not to delightjudge me the world if itis not gross in sensethat thou hast practised on her with foul charmsabused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsthat weaken motion iull have'tdisputed onitis probable and palpable to thinkingI therefore apprehend and do attach theefor an abuser of the world a practiserof arts inhibited and out of warrantlay hold upon him if he do resistsubdue him at his perilhold your handsboth you of my inclining and the restwere it my cue to fight I should have known itwithout a prompter where will you that I goto answer this your chargeto prison till fit timeof law and course of direct sessioncall thee to answerwhat if I do obeyhow may the duke be therewith satisfiedwhose messengers are here about my sideupon some present business of the stateto bring me to himitis true most worthy signiorthe dukes in counseland your noble selfI am sure is sent forhow the duke in counselin this time of the night bring him awaymines not an idle cause the duke himselfor any of my brothers of the statecannot but feel this wrong as itwere their ownfor if such actions may have passage freebond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen bethere is no composition in these newsthat gives them creditindeed they are disproportionedmy letters say a hundred and seven galleysand mine a hundred and fortyand mine two hundredbut though they jump not on a just accountas in these cases where the aim reportsitis oft with difference yet do they all confirma Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprusnay it is possible enough to judgmentI do not so secure me in the errorbut the main article I do approvein fearful sensewhat ho what ho what hoa messenger from the galleysnow whats the businessthe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodesso was I bid report here to the stateby Signior Angelohow say you by this changethis cannot beby no assay of reason itis a pageantto keep us in false gaze when we considerthe importancy of Cyprus to the Turkand let ourselves again but understandthat as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodesso may he with more fale question bear itfor that it stands not in such war-like bracebut altogether lacks the abilitiesthat Rhodes is dressed in if we make thought of thiswe must not think the Turk is so unskilfulto leave that latest which concerns him firstneglecting an attempt of ease and gainto wake and wage a danger profitlessnay in all confidence hes not for Rhodeshere is more newsthe Ottomites reverend and gracioussteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodeshave there injointed them with an after fleetay so I thought how many as you guessof thirty sail and now they do re-stemtheir backward course bearing with frank appearancetheir purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montanoyour trusty and most valiant servitorwith his free duty recommends you thusand prays you to believe himitis certain then for CyprusMarcus Luccos is not he in townhes now in Florencewrite from us to him post-post-haste dispatchhere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moorvaliant Othello we must straight employ youagainst the general enemy OttomanI did not see you welcome gentle signiorwe lacked your counsel and your help to-nightso did I yours Good your grace pardon meneither my place nor aught I heard of businesshath raised me from my bed nor doth the general caretake hold of me for my particular griefis of so flood-gate and oerbearing naturethat it engluts and swallows other sorrowsand it is still itselfwhy whats the mattermy daughter O my daughterdeaddeaday to meshe is abused stoln from me and corruptedby spells and medines bought of mounte-banksfor nature so preposterously to errbeing not defient blind or lame of sensesans witchcraft could notwhoeer he be that in this foul proceedinghath thus beguiled your daughter of herselfand you of her the bloody book of lawyou shall yourself read in the bitter letterafter your own sense yea though our proper sonstood in your actionhumbly I thank your gracehere is the man this Moor whom now it seemsyour speal mandate for the state affairshath hither broughtwe are very sorry for itwe are very sorry for itwhat in your own part can you say to thisnothing but this is somost potent grave and reverend signiorsmy very noble and approved good mastersthat I have taen away this old mans daughterit is most true true I have married herthe very head and front of my offendinghath this extent no more rude am I in my speechand little blessed with the soft phrase of peacefor since these arms of mine had seven years pithtill now some nine moons wasted they have usedtheir dearest action in the tented fieldand little of this great world can I speakmore than pertains to feats of broil and battleand therefore little shall I grace my causein speaking for myself yet by your gracious patienceI will a round unvarnished tale deliverof my whole course of love what drugs what charmswhat conjuration and what mighty magicfor such proceeding I am charged withalI won his daughtera maiden never boldof spirit so still and quiet that her motionblushed at herself and she in spite of natureof years of country credit every thingto fall in love with what she feared to look onit is a judgment maimed and most imperfectthat will confess perfection so could erragainst all rules of nature and must be drivento find out practices of cunning hellwhy this should be I therefore vouch againthat with some mixtures powerful oer the bloodor with some dram conjured to this effecthe wrought upon herto vouch this is no proofwithout more certain and more overt testthan these thin habits and poor likelihoodsof modern seeming do prefer against himbut Othello speakdid you by indirect and forced coursessubdue and poison this young maids affectionsor came it by request and such fair questionas soul to soul affordethI do beseech yousend for the lady to the Sagittaryand let her speak of me before her fatherif you do find me foul in her reportthe trust the office I do hold of younot only take away but let your sentenceeven fall upon my lifefetch Desdemona hitheranent conduct them you best know the placeand till she come as truly as to heavenI do confess the vices of my bloodso justly to your grave ears iull presenthow I did thrive in this fair ladys loveand she in minesay it Othelloher father loved me oft invited mestill questioned me the story of my lifefrom year to year the battles sieges fortunesthat I have passedI ran it through even from my boyish daysto the very moment that he bade me tell itwherein I spake of most disastrous chancesof moving acdents by flood and fieldof hair-breadth scapes inthe imminent deadly breachof being taken by the insolent foeand sold to slavery of my redemption thenceand portance in my travels historywherein of antres vast and desarts idlerough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heavenit was my hint to speak such was the processand of the Cannibals that each other eatthe AnthropophagI and men whose headsdo grow beneath their shoulders this to hearwould Desdemona seriously inclinebut still the house-affairs would draw her thencewhich ever as she could with haste dispatchsheed come again and with a greedy eardevour up my discourse Which I observingtook once a pliant hour and found good meansto draw from her a prayer of earnest heartthat I would all my pilgrimage dilatewhereof by parcels she had something heardbut not intentively I did consentand often did beguile her of her tearswhen I did speak of some distressful strokethat my youth suffered my story being doneshe gave me for my pains a world of sighsshe swore in faith itwas strange itwas passing strangeitwas pitiful itwas wondrous pitifulshe wished she had not heard it yet she wishedthat heaven had made her such a man she thanked meand bade me if I had a friend that loved herI should but teach him how to tell my storyand that would woo her upon this hint I spakeshe loved me for the dangers I had passedand I loved her that she did pity themthis only is the witchcraft I have usedhere comes the lady let her witness itI think this tale would win my daughter toogood Brabantiotake up this mangled matter at the bestmen do their broken weapons rather usethan their bare handsI pray you hear her speakif she confess that she was half the wooerdestruction on my head if my bad blamelight on the man come hither gentle mistressdo you perceive in all this noble companywhere most you owe obediencemy noble fatherI do perceive here a divided dutyto you I am bound for life and educationmy life and education both do learn mehow to respect you you are the lord of dutyI am hitherto your daughter but heres my husbandand so much duty as my mother showedto you preferring you before her fatherso much I challenge that I may professdue to the Moor my lordgod be with you I have doneplease it your grace on to the state affairsI had rather to adopt a child than get itcome hither MoorI here do give thee that with all my heartwhich but thou hast already with all my heartI would keep from thee for your sake jewelI am glad at soul I have no other childfor thy escape would teach me tyrannyto hang clogs on them I have done my lordlet me speak like yourself and lay a sentencewhich as a grize or step may help these loversinto your favourwhen remedies are past the griefs are endedby seeing the worst which late on hopes dependedto mourn a mischief that is past and goneis the next way to draw new mischief onwhat cannot be preserved when fortune takespatience her injury a mockery makesthe robbed that smiles steals something from the thiefhe robs himself that spends a bootless griefso let the Turk of Cyprus us beguilewe lose it not so long as we can smilehe bears the sentence well that nothing bearsbut the free comfort which from thence he hearsbut he bears both the sentence and the sorrowthat to pay grief must of poor patience borrowthese sentences to sugar or to gallbeing strong on both sides are equivocalbut words are words I never yet did hearthat the bruised heart was pierced through the earI humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of statethe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed suffiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expeditionthe tyrant custom most grave senatorshath made the flinty and steel couch of warmy thrice-driven bed of down I do agnizea natural and prompt alacrityI find in hardness and do undertakethese present wars against the Ottomitesmost humbly therefore bending to your stateI crave fit disposition for my wifedue reference of place and exhibitionwith such accommodation and besortas levels with her breedingif you pleasebe'tat her fathersiull not have it sonor Inor I I would not there resideto put my father in impatient thoughtsby being in his eye most gracious duketo my unfolding lend your gracious earand let me find a charter in your voiceto assist my simplenesswhat would you Desdemonathat I did love the Moor to live with himmy downright violence and storm of fortunesmay trumpet to the world my hearts subduedeven to the very quality of my lordI saw Othellos visage in his mindand to his honours and his valiant partsdid I my soul and fortunes consecrateso that dear lords if I be left behinda moth of peace and he go to the warthe rites for which I love him are bereft meand I a heavy interim shall supportby his dear absence let me go with himlet her have your voicesvouch with me heaven I therefore beg it notto please the palate of my appetitenor to comply with heat the young affectsin me defunct and proper satisfactionbut to be free and bounteous to her mindand heaven defend your good souls that you thinkI will your serious and great business scantfor she is with me no when light-winged toysof feathered Cupid seel with wanton dulnessmy speculative and officed instrumentsthat my disports corrupt and taint my businesslet housewives make a skillet of my helmand all indign and base adversitiesmake head against my estimationbe it as you shall privately determineeither for her stay or going the affair cries hasteand speed must answer ityou must away to-nightwith all my heartat nine inthe morning here well meet againothello leave some officer behindand he shall our commission bring to youwith such things else of quality and respectas doth import youso please your grace my anenta man he is of honesty and trustto his conveyance I assign my wifewith what else needful your good grace shall thinkto be sent after melet it be sogood night to every oneand noble signiorif virtue no delighted beauty lackyour son-in-law is far more fair than blackadieu brave Moor use Desdemona welllook to her Moor if thou hast eyes to seeshe has deceived her father and may theemy life upon her faith Honest Iagomy Desdemona must I leave to theeI prithee let thy wife attend on herand bring them after in the best advantagecome Desdemona I have but an hourof love of worldly matters and directionto spend with thee we must obey the timeiagowhat sayst thou noble heartwhat will I do thinkest thouwhy go to bed and sleepI will incontinently drown myselfwell if thou dost I shall never love thee after why thou silly gentlemanit is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physianO villanous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen I would change my humanity with a baboonwhat should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend itvirtue a fig itis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and woed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or sonit cannot beit is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man Drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow these wars defeat thy favour with a usurped beard I say put money in thy purse it cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as lusous as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without herwilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issuethou art sure of me go make money I have told thee often and I re-tell thee again and again I hate the Moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to-morrow Adieuwhere shall we meet inthe morningat my lodgingiull be with thee betimesgo to farewell do you hear Roderigowhat say youno more of drowning do you hearI am changed iull sell all my landgo to farewell put money enough in your pursethus do I ever make my fool my pursefor I mine own gained knowledge should profaneif I would time expend with such a snipebut for my sport and profit I hate the Moorand it is thought abroad that btwixt my sheetshe has done my office I know not if'tbe truebut I for mere suspion in that kindwill do as if for surety he holds me wellthe better shall my purpose work on himcassios a proper man let me see nowto get his place and to plume up my willin double knavery how how lets seeafter some time to abuse Othellos earthat he is too familiar with his wifehe hath a person and a smooth disposeto be suspected framed to make women falsethe Moor is of a free and open naturethat thinks men honest that but seem to be soand will as tenderly be led by the noseas asses areI have'tit is engendered hell and nightmust bring this monstrous birth to the worlds lightwhat from the cape can you discern at seanothing at all it is a high-wrought floodI cannot btwixt the heaven and the maindescry a sailmethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at landa fuller blast neer shook our battlementsif it hath ruffianed so upon the seawhat ribs of oak when mountains melt on themcan hold the mortise what shall we hear of thisa segregation of the Turkish fleetfor do but stand upon the foaming shorethe chidden billow seems to pelt the cloudsthe wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous maneseems to cast water on the burning bearand quench the guards of the ever-fixed poleI never did like molestation viewon the enchafed floodif that the Turkish fleetbe not ensheltered and embayed they are drownedit is impossible they bear it outnews lads our wars are donethe desperate tempest hath so banged the Turksthat their designment halts a noble ship of Venicehath seen a grievous wrack and sufferanceon most part of their fleethow is this truethe ship is here put ina Veronesa Michael Cassiolieutenant to the war-like Moor Othellois come on shore the Moor himselfs at seaand is in full commission here for CyprusI am glad onit itis a worthy governorbut this same Cassio though he speak of comforttouching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadlyand prays the Moor be safe for they were partedwith foul and violent tempestpray heaven he befor I have served him and the man commandslike a full soldier lets to the sea-side hoas well to see the vessel thats come inas to throw out our eyes for brave Othelloeven till we make the main and the aerial bluean indistinct regardcome lets do sofor every minute is expectancyof more arrivancethanks you the valiant of this war-like islethat so approve the Moor O let the heavensgive him defence against the elementsfor I have lost him on a dangerous seais he well shippedhis bark is stoutly timbered and his pilotof very expert and approved allowancetherefore my hopes not surfeited to deathstand in bold curewhat noisethe town is empty on the brow ofthe seastand ranks of people and they cry a sail my hopes do shape him for the governorthey do discharge their shot of courtesyour friends at leastI pray you sir go forthand give us truth who itis that is arrivedI shallbut good lieutenant is your general wivedmost fortunately he hath achieved a maidthat paragons description and wild fameone that excels the quirks of blazoning pensand in th essential vesture of creationdoes tire the ingenerhow now who has put initis one Iago anent to the generalhe has had most favourable and happy speedtempests themselves high seas and howling windsthe guttered rocks and congregated sandstraitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keelas having sense of beauty do omittheir mortal natures letting go safely bythe divine Desdemonawhat is sheshe that I spake of our great captains captainleft in the conduct of the bold Iagowhose footing here antipates our thoughtsa sennights speed great Jove Othello guardand swell his sail with thine own powerful breaththat he may bless this bay with his tall shipmake loves quick pants in Desdemonas armsgive renewed fire to our extinced spiritsand bring all Cyprus comfortO beholdthe riches of the ship is come on shoreye men of Cyprus let her have your kneeshail to thee lady and the grace of heavenbefore behind thee and on every handenwheel thee roundI thank you valiant Cassiowhat tidings can you tell me of my lordhe is not yet arrived nor know I aughtbut that hes well and will be shortly hereO but I fear how lost you companythe great contention of the sea and skiesparted our fellowship but hark a sailthey give their greeting to the tadelthis likewise is a friendsee for the newsgood anent you are welcomewelcome mistresslet it not gall your patience good Iagothat I extend my manners itis my breedingthat gives me this bold show of courtesysir would she give you so much of her lipsas of her tongue she oft bestows on meyoued have enoughalas she has no speechin faith too muchI find it still when I have list to sleepmarry before your ladyship I grantshe puts her tongue a little in her heartand chides with thinkingyou have little cause to say socome on come on you are pictures out of doorsbells in your parlours wild cats in your kitchenssaints in your injuries devils being offendedplayers in your housewifery and housewives in your bedsO fie upon thee slanderernay it is true or else I am a Turkyou rise to play and go to bed to workyou shall not write my praiseno let me notwhat wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise meO gentle lady do not put me to tfor I am nothing if not criticalcome on assay theres one gone to the harbouray madamI am not merry but I do beguilethe thing I am by seeming otherwisecome how wouldst thou praise meI am about it but indeed my inventioncomes from my pate as birdlime does from frizeit plucks out brains and all but my muse laboursand thus she is deliveredif she be fair and wise fairness and witthe ones for use the other useth itwell praised how if she be black and wittyif she be black and thereto have a witshell find a white that shall her blackness fitworse and worsehow if fair and foolishshe never yet was foolish that was fairfor even her folly helped her to an heirthese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh inthe alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolishtheres none so foul and foolish thereuntobut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones doO heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itselfshe that was ever fair and never proudhad tongue at will and yet was never loudnever lacked gold and yet went never gayfled from her wish and yet said now I may she that being angered her revenge being nighbade her wrong stay and her displeasure flyshe that in wisdom never was so frailto change the cods head for the salmons tailshe that could think and neer disclose her mindsee suitors following and not look behindshe was a wight if ever such wight wereto do whatto suckle fools and chronicle small beerO most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband how say you Cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellorhe speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholarhe takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true itis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy itis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clyster-pipes for your sake [a trumpet heard ] the Moor I know his trumpetitis truly solets meet him and receive himlo where he comesO my fair warriormy dear Othelloit gives me wonder great as my contentto see you here before me O my souls joyif after every tempest come such calmsmay the winds blow till they have wakened deathand let the labouring bark climb hills of seasolympus-high and duck again as lowas hells from heaven if it were now to dieitwere now to be most happy for I fearmy soul hath her content so absolutethat not another comfort like to thissucceeds in unknown fatethe heavens forbidbut that our loves and comforts should increaseeven as our days do growamen to that sweet powersI cannot speak enough of this contentit stops me here it is too much of joyand this and this the greatest discords bethat eer our hearts shall makeO you are well tuned nowbut iull set down the pegs that make this musicas honest as I amcome let us to the castlenews friends our wars are done the Turks are drownedhow does my old acquaintance of this islehoney you shall be well desired in CyprusI have found great love amongst them O my sweetI prattle out of fashion and I dotein mine own comforts I prithee good Iagogo to the bay and disembark my coffersbring thou the master to the tadelhe is a good one and his worthinessdoes challenge much respect come Desdemonaonce more well met at Cyprusdo thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou beest valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me the lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard first I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with himwith him why itis not possiblelay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does a knave very voluble no further consonable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder-out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him alreadyI cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed conditionblessed figs end the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark thatyes that I did but that was but courtesylechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts Roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exerse the incorporate conclusion Pish but sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you to-night for the command iull lay'tupon you Cassio knows you not iull not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his displine or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably ministerwellsir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperityI will do this if I can bring it to any opportunityI warrant thee meet me by and by at the tadel I must fetch his necessaries ashorefarewelladieuthat Cassio loves her I do well believe itthat she loves him itis apt and of great creditthe Moor howbeit that I endure him notis of a constant loving noble natureand I dare think hell prove to Desdemonaa most dear husband now I do love her toonot out of absolute lust though peradventureI stand accountant for as great a sinbut partly led to diet my revengefor that I do suspect the lusty Moorhath leaped into my seat the thought whereofdoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwardsand nothing can or shall content my soultill I am evened with him wife for wifeor failing so yet that I put the Moorat least into a jealousy so strongthat judgment cannot cure Which thing to doif this poor trash of Venice whom I trashfor his quick hunting stand the putting oniull have our Michael Cassio on the hipabuse him to the Moor in the rank garbfor I fear Cassio with my night-cap toomake the Moor thank me love me and reward mefor making him egregiously an assand practising upon his peace and quieteven to madness itis here but yet confusedknaverys plain face is never seen till usedit is Othellos pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these benefial news it is the celebration of his nuptial so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othellogood Michael look you to the guard to-nightlets teach ourselves that honourable stopnot to outsport discretioniago hath direction what to dobut notwithstanding with my personal eyewill I look to tiago is most honestmichael good night to-morrow with your earliestlet me have speech with youcome my dear lovethe purchase made the fruits are to ensuethat profits yet to come btwixt me and yougood nightwelcome Iago we must to the watchnot this hour lieutenant itis not yet ten ofthe clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for Joveshes a most exquisite ladyand iull warrant her full of gameindeed she is a most fresh and delicate creaturewhat an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocationan inviting eye and yet methinks right modestand when she speaks is it not an alarum to loveshe is indeed perfectionwell happiness to their sheets come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othellonot to-night good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainmentO they are our friends but one cup iull drink for youI have drunk but one cup to-night and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any morewhat man itis a night of revels the gallants desire itwhere are theyhere at the door I pray you call them iniull doit but it dislikes meif I can fasten but one cup upon himwith that which he hath drunk to-night alreadyhell be as full of quarrel and offenceas my young mistress dog now my sick fool Roderigowhom love has turned almost the wrong side outto Desdemona hath to-night carousedpotations pottle deep and hes to watchthree lads of Cyprus noble swelling spiritsthat hold their honours in a wary distancethe very elements of this war-like islehave I to-night flustered with flowing cupsand they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkardsam I to put our Cassio in some actionthat may offend the isle but here they comeif consequence do but approve my dreammy boat sails freely both with wind and streamfore God they have given me a rouse alreadygood faith a little one not past a pint as I am a soldiersome wine hoand let me the canakin clink clinkand let me the canakin clinka soldiers a mana lifes but a spanwhy then let a soldier drinksome wine boysfore God an excellent songI learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting your Dane your German and your swag-bellied Hollander drink ho are nothing to your Englishis your Englishman so expert in his drinkingwhy he drinks you with fality your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filledto the health of our generalI am for it lieutenant and iull do you justiceO sweet Englandking Stephen was a worthy peerhis breeches cost him but a crownhe held them sixpence all too dearwith that he called the tailor lownhe was a wight of high renownand thou art but of low degreeitis pride that pulls the country downthen take thine auld cloak about theesome wine howhy this is a more exquisite song than the otherwill you hear'tagainno for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things well Gods above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be savedits true good lieutenantfor mine own part

gone beforehe is a soldier fit to stand by Ceasarand give direction and do but see his viceitis to his virtue a just equinoxthe one as long as the other itis pity of himI fear the trust Othello puts him inon some odd time of his infirmitywill shake this islandbut is he often thusitis evermore the prologue to his sleephell watch the horologe a double setif drink rock not his cradleit were wellthe general were put in mind of itperhaps he sees it not or his good natureprizes the virtue that appears in Cassioand looks not on his evils is not this truehow now RoderigoI pray you after the lieutenant goand itis great pity that the noble Moorshould hazard such a place as his own secondwith one of an ingraft infirmityit were an honest action to sayso to the Moornot I for this fair islandI do love Cassio well and would do muchto cure him of this evil but hark what noiseyou rogue you rascalwhats the matter lieutenanta knave teach me my dutyiull beat the knave into

what is the matter mastershonest Iago that lookest dead with grievingspeak who began this on thy love I charge theeI do not know friends all but now even nowin quarter and in terms like bride and groomdevesting them for bed and then but nowas if some planet had unwitted menswords out and tilting one at others breastin opposition bloody I cannot speakany beginning to this peevish oddsand would in action glorious I had lostthose legs that brought me to a part of ithow comes it Michael you are thus forgotI pray you pardon me I cannot speakworthy Montano you were wont be vilthe gravity and stillness of your youththe world hath noted and your name is greatin mouths of wisest censure whats the matterthat you unlace your reputation thusand spend your rich opinion for the nameof a night-brawler give me answer to itworthy Othello I am hurt to dangeryour officer Iago can inform youwhile I spare speech which something now offends meof all that I do know nor know I aughtby me thats said or done amiss this nightunless self-charity be sometimes a viceand to defend ourselves it be a sinwhen violence assails usnow by heavenmy blood begins my safer guides to ruleand passion having my best judgment colliedassays to lead the way if I once stiror do but lift this arm the best of youshall sink in my rebuke give me to knowhow this foul rout began who set it onand he that is approved in this offencethough he had twinned with me both at a birthshall lose me what in a town of waryet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fearto manage private and domestic quarrelin night and on the court and guard of safetyitis monstrous Iago who began tif partially affined or leagued in officethou dost deliver more or less than truththou art no soldiertouch me not so nearI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouththan it should do offence to Michael Cassioyet I persuade myself to speak the truthshall nothing wrong him thus it is generalmontano and myself being in speechthere comes a fellow crying out for hepand Cassio following with determined swordto execute upon him sir this gentlemansteps in to Cassio and entreats his pausemyself the crying fellow did pursuelest by his clamour as it so fell outthe town might fall in fright he swift of footoutran my purpose and I returned the ratherfor that I heard the clink and fall of swordsand Cassio high in oath which till to-nightI neer might say before when I came backfor this was brief I found them close togetherat blow and thrust even as again they werewhen you yourself did part themmore of this matter can I not reportbut men are men the best sometimes forgetthough Cassio did some little wrong to himas men in rage strike those that wish them bestyet surely Cassio I believe receivedfrom him that fled some strange indignitywhich patience could not passI know Iagothy honesty and love doth mince this mattermaking it light to Cassio Cassio I love theebut never more be officer of minelook if my gentle love be not raised upiull make thee an examplewhats the matteralls well now sweeting come away to bedsir for your hurts myself will be your surgeonlead him offiago look with care about the townand silence those whom this vile brawl distractedcome Desdemona itis the soldiers lifeto have their balmy slumbers waked with strifewhat are you hurt lieutenantay past all surgerymarry heaven forbidreputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation Iago my reputationas I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more offence in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion Sue to him again and he is yoursI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devilwhat was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to youI know notis it possibleI remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beastswhy but you are now well enough how came you thus recoveredit hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myselfcome you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own goodI will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devilcome come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant I think you think I love youI have well approved it sir I drunkyou or any man living may be drunk at some time man iull tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her shell help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was beforeyou advise me wellI protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindnessI think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me hereyou are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watchgood night honest Iagoand whats he then that says I play the villainwhen this advice is free I give and honestprobal to thinking and indeed the courseto win the Moor again for itis most easythe inclining Desdemona to subduein any honest suit shes framed as fruitfulas the free elements and then for herto win the Moor were'tto renounce his baptismall seals and symbols of redeemed sinhis soul is so enfettered to her lovethat she may make unmake do what she listeven as her appetite shall play the godwith his weak function how am I then a villainto counsel Cassio to this parallel coursedirectly to his good Divinity of hellwhen devils will the blackest sins put onthey do suggest at first with heavenly showsas I do now for while this honest foolplies Desdemona to repair his fortunesand she for him pleads strongly to the Mooriull pour this pestilence into his earthat she repeals him for her bodys lustand by how much she strives to do him goodshe shall undo her credit with the Moorso will I turn her virtue into pitchand out of her own goodness make the netthat shall enmesh them allhow now RoderigoI do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venicehow poor are they that have not patiencewhat wound did ever heal but by degreesthou knowest we work by wit and not by witchcraftand wit depends on dilatory timedoes'tnot go well Cassio hath beaten theeand thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassiothough other things grow fair against the sunyet fruits that blossom first will first be ripecontent thyself awhile by the mass itis morningpleasure and action make the hours seem shortretire thee go where thou art billetedaway I say thou shalt know more hereafternay get thee gonetwo things are to be donemy wife must move for Cassio to her mistressiull set her onmyself the while to draw the Moor apartand bring him jump when he may Cassio findsoliting his wife ay thats the waydull not device by coldness and delaymasters play here I will content your painssomething thats brief and bid Good morrow general why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak inthe nose thushow sir howare these I pray you wind-instrumentsay marry are they sirO thereby hangs a tailwhereby hangs a tale sirmarry sir by many a wind-instrument that I know but masters heres money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for loves sake to make no more noise with itwell sir we will notif you have any music that may not be heard to'tagain but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly carewe have none such sirthen put up your pipes in your bag foriull away go vanish into air awaydost thou hear mine honest friendno I hear not your honest friend I hear youprithee keep up thy quillets theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell her theres one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech wilt thou do thisshe is stirring sir if she will stir hitherI shall seem to notify unto herdo good my friendin happy time Iagoyou have not been a-bed thenwhy no the day had brokebefore we parted I have made bold Iagoto send in to your wife my suit to heris that she will to virtuous Desdemonaprocure me some accessiull send her to you presentlyand iull devise a mean to draw the Moorout of the way that your converse and businessmay be more freeI humbly thank you foritI never knewa Florentine more kind and honestgood morrow good lieutenant I am sorryfor your displeasure but all will soon be wellthe general and his wife are talking of itand she speaks for you stoutly the Moor repliesthat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprusand great affinity and that in wholesome wisdomhe might not but refuse you but he protests he loves youand needs no other suitor but his likingsto take the safest occasion by the frontto bring you in againyet I beseech youif you think fit or that it may be donegive me advantage of some brief discoursewith Desdemona alonepray you come inI will bestow you where you shall have timeto speak your bosom freelyI am much bound to youthese letters give Iago to the pilotand by him do my duties to the senatethat done I will be walking on the worksrepair there to mewell my good lord iull do tthis fortification gentlemen shall we seeitwell wait upon your lordshipbe thou assured good Cassio I will doall my abilities in thy behalfgood madam do I warrant it grieves my husbandas if the case were hisO thats an honest fellow do not doubt Cassiobut I will have my lord and you againas friendly as you werebounteous madamwhatever shall become of Michael Cassiohes never anything but your true servantI know'tI thank you you do love my lordyou have known him long and be you well assuredhe shall in strangeness stand no further offthan in a politic distanceay but ladythat policy may either last so longor feed upon such nice and waterish dietor breed itself so out of rcumstancethat I being absent and my place suppliedmy general will forget my love and servicedo not doubt that before Emilia hereI give thee warrant of thy place Assure theeif I do vow a friendship iull perform itto the last article my lord shall never restiull watch him tame and talk him out of patiencehis bed shall seem a school his board a shriftiull intermingle every thing he doeswith Cassios suit therefore be merry Cassiofor thy solitor shall rather diethan give thy cause awaymadam here comes my lordmadam iull take my leavewhy stay and hear me speakmadam not now I am very ill at easeunfit for mine own purposeswell do your discretionha I like not thatwhat dost thou saynothing my lord or if I know not whatwas not that Cassio parted from my wifecassio my lord no sure I cannot think itthat he would steal away so guilty-likeseeing you comingI do believe itwas hehow now my lordI have been talking with a suitor herea man that languishes in your displeasurewho is it you meanwhy your lieutenant Cassio Good my lordif I have any grace or power to move youhis present reconliation takefor if he be not one that truly loves youthat errs in ignorance and not in cunningI have no judgment in an honest faceI prithee call him backwent he hence noway sooth so humbledthat he hath left part of his grief with meto suffer with him Good love call him backnot now sweet Desdemona some other timebut shall'tbe shortlythe sooner sweet for youshall'tbe to-night at supperno not to-nightto-morrow dinner thenI shall not dine at homeI meet the captains at the tadelwhy then to-morrow night or Tuesday mornon Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday mornI prithee name the time but let it notexceed three days in faith hes penitentand yet his trespass in our common reasonsave that they say the wars must make examplesout of their best is not almost a faultto incur a private check when shall he cometell me Othello I wonder in my soulwhat you could ask me that I should denyor stand so mammering on what Michael Cassiothat came a wooing with you and so many a timewhen I have spoke of you dispraisinglyhath taen your part to have so much to doto bring him in trust me I could do muchprithee no more let him come when he willI will deny thee nothingwhy this is not a boonitis as I should entreat you wear your glovesor feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warmor sue to you to do a peculiar profitto your own person nay when I have a suitwherein I mean to touch your love indeedit shall be full of poise and difficult weightand fearful to be grantedI will deny thee nothingwhereon I do beseech thee grant me thisto leave me but a little to myselfshall I deny you no farewell my lordfarewell my Desdemona iull come to thee straightemilia come be as your fanes teach youwhateer you be I am obedientexcellent wretch Perdition catch my soulbut I do love thee and when I love thee notchaos is come againmy noble lordwhat dost thou say Iagodid Michael Cassio when you wooed my ladyknow of your lovehe did from first to last why dost thou askbut for a satisfaction of my thoughtno further harmwhy of thy thought IagoI did not think he had been acquainted with herO yes and went between us very oftindeedindeed ay indeed discernest thou aught in thatis he not honesthonest my lordhonest ay honestmy lord for aught I knowwhat dost thou thinkthink my lordthink my lordby heaven he echoes meas if there were some monster in his thoughttoo hideous to be shown thou dost mean somethingI heard thee say but now thou likedst not thatwhen Cassio left my wife what didst not likeand when I told thee he was of my counselin my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow togetheras if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainsome horrible conceit if thou dost love meshow me thy thoughtmy lord you know I love youI think thou dostand for I know thou art full of love and honestyand weighest thy words before thou givest them breaththerefore these stops of thine fright me the morefor such things in a false disloyal knaveare tricks of custom but in a man thats justthey are close delations working from the heartthat passion cannot rulefor Michael CassioI dare be sworn I think that he is honestI think so toomen should be what they seemor those that be not would they might seem nonecertain men should be what they seemwhy then I think Cassio s an honest mannay yet theres more in thisI pray thee speak to me as to thy thinkingsas thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughtsthe worst of wordsgood my lord pardon methough I am bound to every act of dutyI am not bound to that all slaves are free toutter my thoughts why say they are vile and falseas wheres that palace whereinto foul thingssometimes intrude not who has a breast so purebut some uncleanly apprehensionskeep leets and law days and in session sitwith meditations lawfulthou dost conspire against thy friend Iagoif thou but thinkest him wronged and makest his eara stranger to thy thoughtsI do beseech youthough I perchance am vious in my guessas I confess it is my natures plagueto spy into abuses and oft my jealousyshapes faults that are not that your wisdom yetfrom one that so imperfectly conceitswould take no notice nor build yourself a troubleout of his scattering and unsure observanceit were not for your quiet nor your goodnor for my manhood honesty or wisdomto let you know my thoughtswhat dost thou meangood name in man and woman dear my lordis the immediate jewel of their soulswho steals my purse steals trash itis something nothingitwas mine itis his and has been slave to thousandsbut he that filches from me my good namerobs me of that which not enriches himand makes me poor indeedby heaven iull know thy thoughtsyou cannot if my heart were in your handnor shall not whilst itis in my custodyhaO beware my lord of jealousyit is the green-eyed monster which doth mockthe meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in blisswho certain of his fate loves not his wrongerbut O what damned minutes tells he oerwho dotes yet doubts suspects yet soundly lovesO miserypoor and content is rich and rich enoughbut riches fineless is as poor as winterto him that ever fears he shall be poorgood heaven the souls of all my tribe defendfrom jealousywhy why is thisthinkest thou id make a life of jealousyto follow still the changes of the moonwith fresh suspions no to be once in doubtis once to be resolved exchange me for a goatwhen I shall turn the business of my soulto such exsufflicate and blown surmisesmatching thy inference itis not to make me jealousto say my wife is fair feeds well loves companyis free of speech sings plays and dances wellwhere virtue is these are more virtuousnor from mine own weak merits will I drawthe smallest fear or doubt of her revoltfor she had eyes and chose me no Iagoiull see before I doubt when I doubt proveand on the proof there is no more but thisaway at once with love or jealousyI am glad of it for now I shall have reasonto show the love and duty that I bear youwith franker spirit therefore as I am boundreceive it from me I speak not yet of prooflook to your wife observe her well with Cassiowear your eye thus not jealous nor secureI would not have your free and noble natureout of self-bounty be abused look to tI know our country disposition wellin Venice they do let heaven see the pranksthey dare not show their husbands their best consenceis not to leave'tundone but keep'tunknowndost thou say soshe did deceive her father marrying youand when she seemed to shake and fear your looksshe loved them mostand so she didwhy go to thenshe that so young could give out such a seemingto seel her fathers eyes up close as oakhe thought itwas witchcraft but I am much to blameI humbly do beseech you of your pardonfor too much loving youI am bound to thee for everI see this hath a little dashed your spiritsnot a jot not a jotinfaith I fear it hasI hope you will consider what is spokecomes from my love but I do see youre movedI am to pray you not to strain my speechto grosser issues nor to larger reachthan to suspionI will notshould you do so my lordmy speech should fall into such vile successas my thoughts aim not at Cassios my worthy friendmy lord I see youre movedno not much movedI do not think but Desdemonas honestlong live she so and long live you to think soand yet how nature erring from itselfay theres the point as to be bold with younot to affect many proposed matchesof her own clime complexion and degreewhereto we see in all things nature tendsfoh one may smell in such a will most rankfoul disproportion thoughts unnaturalbut pardon me I do not in positiondistinctly speak of her though I may fearher will recoiling to her better judgmentmay fail to match you with her country formsand happily repentfarewell farewellif more thou dost perceive let me know moreset on thy wife to observe Leave me Iagomy lord I take my leavewhy did I marry this honest creature doubtlesssees and knows more much more than he unfoldsmy lord I would I might entreat your honourto scan this thing no further leave it to timealthough itis fit that Cassio have his placefor sure he fills it up with great abilityyet if you please to hold him off awhileyou shall by that perceive him and his meansnote if your lady strain his entertainmentwith any strong or vehement importunitymuch will be seen in that in the mean timelet me be thought too busy in my fearsas worthy cause I have to fear I amand hold her free I do beseech your honourfear not my governmentI once more take my leavethis fellows of exceeding honestyand knows all qualities with a learned spiritof human dealings if I do prove her haggardthough that her jesses were my dear heartstringsied whistle her off and let her down the windto prey at fortune Haply for I am blackand have not those soft parts of conversationthat chamberers have or for I am declinedinto the vale of years yet thats not muchshes gone I am abused and my reliefmust be to loathe her O curse of marriagethat we can call these delicate creatures oursand not their appetites I had rather be a toadand live upon the vapour of a dungeonthan keep a corner in the thing I lovefor others uses yet itis the plague of great onesprerogatived are they less than the baseitis destiny unshunnable like deatheven then this forked plague is fated to uswhen we do quickenlook where she comesif she be false O then heaven mocks itselfiull not believe ithow now my dear Othelloyour dinner and the generous islandersby you invited do attend your presenceI am to blamewhy do you speak so faintlyare you not wellI have a pain upon my forehead herefaith thats with watching itwill away againlet me but bind it hard within this hourit will be wellyour napkin is too littlelet it alone come iull go in with youI am very sorry that you are not wellI am glad I have found this napkinthis was her first remembrance from the Moormy wayward husband hath a hundred timeswooed me to steal it but she so loves the tokenfor he conjured her she should ever keep itthat she reserves it evermore about herto kiss and talk to iull have the work taen outand give'tIagowhat he will do with it heaven knows not II nothing but to please his fantasyhow now what do you here alonedo not you chide I have a thing for youa thing for me it is a common thinghato have a foolish wifeO is that all what will you give me nowfor that same handkerchiefwhat handkerchiefwhat handkerchiefwhy that the Moor first gave to Desdemonathat which so often you did bid me stealhast stoln it from herno faith she let it drop by negligenceand to the advantage I being there tookt uplook here it isa good wench give it mewhat will you do with'tthat you have been so earnestto have me filch itwhy whats that to youif it be not for some purpose of importgive'tme again poor lady shell run madwhen she shall lack itbe not acknown onit I have use for itgo leave meI will in Cassios lodging lose this napkinand let him find it trifles light as airare to the jealous confirmations strongas proofs of holy writ this may do somethingthe Moor already changes with my poisondangerous conceits are in their natures poisonswhich at the first are scarce found to distastebut with a little act upon the bloodburn like the mines of sulphur I did say solook where he comesnot poppy nor mandragoranor all the drowsy syrups of the worldshall ever medine thee to that sweet sleepwhich thou owedst yesterdayha ha false to mewhy how now generall no more of thatavaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rackI swear itis better to be much abusedthan but to know'ta littlehow now my lordwhat sense had I of her stoln hours of lustI saw'tnot thought it not it harmed not meI slept the next night well was free and merryI found not Cassios kisses on her lipshe that is robbed not wanting what is stolnlet him not know'tand hes not robbed at allI am sorry to hear thisI had been happy if the general camppioners and all had tasted her sweet bodyso I had nothing known O now for everfarewell the tranquil mind farewell contentfarewell the plumed troop and the big warsthat make ambition virtue O farewellfarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trumpthe spirit-stirring drum the ear-pierng fifethe royal banner and all qualitypride pomp and rcumstance of glorious warand O you mortal engines whose rude throatsthe immortal Joves dread clamours counterfeitfarewell Othellos occupations goneis it possible my lordvillain be sure thou prove my love a whorebe sure of it give me the ocular proofor by the worth of mine eternal soulthou hadst been better have been born a dogthan answer my waked wrathis it come to thismake me to seeit or at the least so prove itthat the probation bear no hinge nor loopto hang a doubt on or woe upon thy lifemy noble lordif thou dost slander her and torture menever pray more abandon all remorseon horrors head horrors accumulatedo deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazedfor nothing canst thou to damnation addgreater than thatO grace O heaven forgive meare you a man have you a soul or sensegod be wityou take mine office O wretched foolthat livest to make thine honesty a viceO monstrous world take note take note O worldto be direct and honest is not safeI thank you for this profit and from henceiull love no friend sith love breeds such offencenay stay thou shouldst be honestI should be wise for honestys a fooland loses that it works forby the worldI think my wife be honest and think she is notI think that thou art just and think thou art notiull have some proof her name that was as freshas Dians visage is now begrimed and blackas mine own face if there be cords or knivespoison or fire or suffocating streamsiull not endure it would I were satisfiedI see sir you are eaten up with passionI do repent me that I put it to youyou would be satisfiedwould nay I willand may but how how satisfied my lordwould you the supervisor grossly gape onbehold her tuppeddeath and damnation Oit were a tedious difficulty I thinkto bring them to that prospect damn them thenif ever mortal eyes do see them bolstermore than their own what then how thenwhat shall I say wheres satisfactionit is impossible you should see thiswere they as prime as goats as hot as monkeysas salt as wolves in pride and fools as grossas ignorance made drunk but yet I sayif imputation and strong rcumstanceswhich lead directly to the door of truthwill give you satisfaction you may have itgive me a living reason shes disloyalI do not like the officebut sith I am entered in this cause so farpricked to'tby foolish honesty and loveI will go on I lay with Cassio latelyand being troubled with a raging toothI could not sleepthere are a kind of men so loose of soulthat in their sleeps will mutter their affairsone of this kind is Cassioin sleep I heard him say sweet Desdemonalet us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my handcry O sweet creature and then kiss me hardas if he plucked up kisses by the rootsthat grew upon my lips then laid his legover my thigh and sighed and kissed and thencried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor O monstrous monstrousnay this was but his dreambut this denoted a foregone conclusionitis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dreamand this may help to thicken other proofsthat do demonstrate thinlyiull tear her all to piecesnay but be wise yet we see nothing doneshe may be honest yet Tell me but thishave you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefspotted with strawberries in your wifes handI gave her such a one itwas my first giftI know not that but such a handkerchiefI am sure it was your wifes did I to-daysee Cassio wipe his beard withif it be thatif it be that or any that was hersit speaks against her with the other proofsO that the slave had forty thousand livesone is too poor too weak for my revengenow do I see itis true look here Iagoall my fond love thus do I blow to heavenitis gonearise black vengeance from the hollow hellyield up O love thy crown and hearted throneto tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraughtfor itis of aspics tonguesyet be contentO blood blood bloodpatience I say your mind perhaps may changenever Iago Like to the Pontick seawhose icy current and compulsive courseneer feels retiring ebb but keeps due onto the Propontic and the Hellesponteven so my bloody thoughts with violent paceshall neer look back neer ebb to humble lovetill that a capable and wide revengeswallow them upnow by yond marble heavenin the due reverence of a sacred vowI here engage my wordsdo not rise yetwitness you ever-burning lights aboveyou elements that clip us round aboutwitness that here Iago doth give upthe execution of his wit hands heartto wronged Othellos service let him commandand to obey shall be in me remorsewhat bloody business everI greet thy lovenot with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteousand will upon the instant put thee to twithin these three days let me hear thee saythat Cassios not alivemy friend is dead itis done at your requestbut let her livedamn her lewd minx O damn hercome go with me apart I will withdrawto furnish me with some swift means of deathfor the fair devil now art thou my lieutenantI am your own for everdo you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio liesI dare not say he lies any wherewhy manhe is a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbinggo to where lodges heto tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I liecan anything be made of thisI know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throatcan you inquire him out and be edified by reportI will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answerseek him bid him come hither tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf and hope all will be wellto do this is within the compass of mans wit and therefore I will attempt the doing itwhere should I lose that handkerchief EmiliaI know not madambelieve me I had rather have lost my pursefull of cruzadoes and but my noble Mooris true of mind and made of no such basenessas jealous creatures are it were enoughto put him to ill thinkingis he not jealouswho he I think the sun where he was borndrew all such humours from himlook where he comesI will not leave him now till Cassiobe called to himhow is it with you my lordwell my good ladyO hardness to dissemblehow do you Desdemonawell my good lordgive me your hand this hand is moist my ladyit yet has felt no age nor known no sorrowthis argues fruitfulness and liberal hearthot hot and moist this hand of yours requiresa sequester from liberty fasting and prayermuch castigation exerse devoutfor heres a young and sweating devil herethat commonly rebels itis a good handa frank oneyou may indeed say sofor itwas that hand that gave away my hearta liberal hand the hearts of old gave handsbut our new heraldry is hands not heartsI cannot speak of this come now your promisewhat promise chuckI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with youI have a salt and sorry rheum offends melend me thy handkerchiefhere my lordthat which I gave youI have it not about menotno indeed my lordthat is a faultthat handkerchiefdid an Egyptian to my mother giveshe was a charmer and could almost readthe thoughts of people she told her while she kept ittwould make her amiable and subdue my fatherentirely to her love but if she lost itor made a gift of it my fathers eyeshould hold her loathed and his spirits should huntafter new fanes she dying gave it meand bid me when my fate would have me wiveto give it her I did so and take heed onitmake it a darling like your precious eyeto loset or givet away were such perditionas nothing else could matchis it possibleitis true theres magic in the web of ita sibyl that had numbered in the worldthe sun to course two hundred compassesin her prophetic fury sewed the workthe worms were hallowed that did breed the silkand it was dyed in mummy which the skilfulconserved of maidens heartsindeed is it truemost veritable therefore look to'twellthen would to heaven that I had never seen itha whereforewhy do you speak so startingly and rashis it lost is it gone speak is it out ofthe wayheaven bless ussay youit is not lost but what an if it werehowI say it is not lostfetch'tlet me seeitwhy so I can sir but I will not nowthis is a trick to put me from my suitpray you let Cassio be received againfetch me the handkerchief my mind misgivescome comeyoull never meet a more suffient manthe handkerchiefI pray talk me of Cassiothe handkerchiefa man that all his timehath founded his good fortunes on your loveshared dangers with youthe handkerchiefin sooth you are to blameawayis not this man jealousI neer saw this beforesure theres some wonder in this handkerchiefI am most unhappy in the loss of ititis not a year or two shows us a manthey are all but stomachs and we all but foodthey eat us hungerly and when they are fullthey belch us look you Cassio and my husbandthere is no other way itis she must doitand lo the happiness go and importune herhow now good Cassio whats the news with youmadam my former suit I do beseech youthat by your virtuous means I may againexist and be a member of his lovewhom I with all the office of my heartentirely honour I would not be delayedif my offence be of such mortal kindthat nor my service past nor present sorrowsnor purposed merit in futuritycan ransom me into his love againbut to know so must be my benefitso shall I clothe me in a forced contentand shut myself up in some other courseto fortunes almsalas thrice-gentle Cassiomy advocation is not now in tunemy lord is not my lord nor should I know himwere he in favour as in humour alteredso help me every spirit sanctifiedas I have spoken for you all my bestand stood within the blank of his displeasurefor my free speech you must awhile be patientwhat I can do I will and more I willthan for myself I dare let that suffice youis my lord angryhe went hence but nowand certainly in strange unquietnesscan he be angry I have seen the cannonwhen it hath blown his ranks into the airand like the devil from his very armpuffed his own brother and can he be angrysomething of moment then I will go meet himtheres matter init indeed if he be angryI prithee do sosomething sure of stateeither from Venice or some unhatched practicemade demonstrable here in Cyprus to himhath puddled his clear spirit and in such casesmens natures wrangle with inferior thingsthough great ones are their object itis even sofor let our finger ache and it induesour other healthful members evn to that senseof pain nay we must think men are not godsnor of them look for such observancyas fits the bridal beshrew me much EmiliaI was unhandsome warrior as I amarraigning his unkindness with my soulbut now I find I had suborned the witnessand hes indicted falselypray heaven it be state-matters as you thinkand no conception nor no jealous toyconcerning youalas the day I never gave him causebut jealous souls will not be answered sothey are not ever jealous for the causebut jealous for they are jealous itis a monsterbegot upon itself born on itselfheaven keep that monster from Othellos mindlady amenI will go seek him Cassio walk hereaboutif I do find him fit iull move your suitand seek

I am sure I am none suchdo not weep do not weep Alas the dayhas she forsook so many noble matchesher father and her country and her friendsto be called whore would it not make one weepit is my wretched fortunebeshrew him for ithow comes this trick upon himnay heaven doth knowI will be hanged if some eternal villainsome busy and insinuating roguesome cogging cozening slave to get some officehave not devised this slander iull be hanged elsefie there is no such man it is impossibleif any such there be heaven pardon hima halter pardon him and hell gnaw his boneswhy should he call her whore who keeps her companywhat place what time what form what likelihoodthe Moors abused by some most villanous knavesome base notorious knave some scurvy fellowO heaven that such companions

not how I lost him here I kneelif eer my will did trespass gainst his loveeither in discourse of thought or actual deedor that mine eyes mine ears or any sensedelighted them in any other formor that I do not yet and ever didand ever will though he do shake me offto beggarly divorcement love him dearlycomfort forswear me unkindness may do muchand his unkindness may defeat my lifebut never taint my love I cannot say whore it does abhor me now I speak the wordto do the act that might the addition earnnot the worlds mass of vanity could make meI pray you be content itis but his humourthe business of the state does him offenceand he does chide with youif itwere no otheritis but so I warranthark how these instruments summon to supperthe messengers of Venice stay the meatgo in and weep not all things shall be wellhow now RoderigoI do not find that thou dealest justly with mewhat in the contraryevery day thou daffest me with some device Iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly sufferedwill you hear me Roderigofaith I have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin togetheryou charge me most unjustlywith nought but truth I have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she has received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I find nonewell go to very wellvery well go to I cannot go to man nor itis not very well by this hand I say it is very scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in itvery wellI tell you itis not very well I will make myself known to Desdemona if she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solitation if not assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of youyou have said noway and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doingwhy now I see theres mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before give me thy hand Roderigo thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affairit hath not appearedI grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspion is not without wit and judgment but Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean purpose courage and valour this night show it if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my lifewell what is it is it within reason and compasssir there is espeal commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othellos placeis that true why then Othello and Desdemona return again to VeniceO no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some acdent wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassiohow do you mean removing of himwhy by making him uncapable of Othellos place knocking out his brainsand that you would have me doay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right he sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will I go to him he knows not yet of his honourable fortune if you will watch his going thence which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure I will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him it is now high supper-time and the night grows to waste about itI will hear further reason for thisand you shall be satisfiedI do beseech you sir trouble yourself no furtherO pardon me itwill do me good to walkmadam good night I humbly thank your ladyshipyour honour is most welcomewill you walk sirO Desdemonamy lordget you to bed on the instant I will be returned forthwith dismiss your attendant there look it be doneI will my lordhow goes it now he looks gentler than he didhe says he will return incontinenthe hath commanded me to go to bedand bade me to dismiss youdismiss meit was his bidding therefore good Emiliagive me my nightly wearing and adieuwe must not now displease himI would you had never seen himso would not I my love doth so approve himthat even his stubbornness his checks and frownsprithee unpin me have grace and favour in themI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bedalls one Good faith how foolish are our mindsif I do die before thee prithee shroud mein one of those same sheetscome come you talkmy mother had a maid called Barbarashe was in love and he she loved proved madand did forsake her she had a song of willow an old thing itwas but it expressed her fortuneand she died singing it that song to-nightwill not go from my mind I have much to dobut to go hang my head all at one sideand sing it like poor Barbara Prithee dispatchshall I go fetch your night-gownno unpin me herethis Lodovico is a proper mana very handsome manhe speaks wellI know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lipthe poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore treesing all a green willowher hand on her bosom her head on her kneesing willow willow willowthe fresh streams ran by her and murmured her moanssing willow willow willowher salt tears fell from her and softened the stoneslay by thesesing willow willow willowprithee chide thee hell come anonsing all a green willow must be my garlandlet nobody blame him his scorn I approvenay thats not next hark who is it that knocksit is the windI called my love false love but what said he thensing willow willow willowif I court more women youll couch with more menso get thee gone good night mine eyes do itchdoth that bode weepingitis neither here nor thereI have heard it said so O these men these mendost thou in consence think tell me Emiliathat there be women do abuse their husbandsin such gross kindthere be some such no questionwouldst thou do such a deed for all the worldwhy would not youno by this heavenly lightnor I neither by this heavenly light might doit as well inthe darkwouldst thou do such a deed for all the worldthe world is a huge thing itis a great pricefor a small vicein truth I think thou wouldst notin truth I think I should and undoit when I had done Marry I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring nor measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I should venture purgatory foritbeshrew me if I would do such a wrongfor the whole worldwhy the wrong is but a wrong inthe world and having the world for your labour itis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it rightI do not think there is any such womanyes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played forbut I do think it is their husbands faultsif wives do fall Say that they slack their dutiesand pour our treasures into foreign lapsor else break out in peevish jealousiesthrowing restraint upon us or say they strike usor scant our former having in despitewhy we have galls and though we have some graceyet have we some revenge let husbands knowtheir wives have sense like them they see and smelland have their palates both for sweet and souras husbands have what is it that they dowhen they change us for others is it sportI think it is and doth affection breed itI think it doth is it frailty that thus errsit is so too and have not we affectionsdesires for sport and frailty as men havethen let them use us well else let them knowthe ills we do their ills instruct us sogood night good night heaven me such usage sendnot to pick bad from bad but by bad mendhere stand behind this bulk straight will he comewear thy good rapier bare and put it homequick quick fear nothing iull be at thy elbowit makes us or it mars us think on thatand fix most firm thy resolutionbe near at hand I may miscarry inithere at thy hand be bold and take thy standI have no great devotion to the deedand yet he has given me satisfying reasonsitis but a man gone forth my sword he diesI have rubbed this young quat almost to the senseand he grows angry now whether he kill Cassioor Cassio him or each do kill the otherevery way makes my gain live Roderigohe calls me to a restitution largeof gold and jewels that I bobbed from himas gifts to Desdemonait must not be if Cassio do remainhe hath a daily beauty in his lifethat makes me ugly and besides the Moormay unfold me to him there stand I in much perilno he must die but so I hear him comingI know his gait itis he villain thou diestthat thrust had been mine enemy indeedbut that my coat is better than thou knowestI will make proof of thineO I am slainI am maimed for ever help ho murder murderthe voice of Cassio Iago keeps his wordO villain that I amit is een soO help ho light a surgeonitis he O brave Iago honest and justthat hast such noble sense of thy friends wrongthou teachest me Minion your dear lies deadand your unblest fate hies strumpet I comeforth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blottedthy bed lust-stained shall with lusts blood be

sent this damned villainbut that belike Iago in the interimcame in and satisfied himO the pernious caitiffhow came you Cassio by that handkerchiefthat was my wifesI found it in my chamberand he himself confessed but even nowthat there he dropped it for a speal purposewhich wrought to his desireO fool fool foolthere is besides in Roderigos letterhow he upbraids Iago that he made himbrave me upon the watch whereon it camethat I was cast and even but now he spakeafter long seeming dead Iago hurt himiago set him onyou must forsake this room and go with usyour power and your command is taken offand Cassio rules in Cyprus for this slaveif there be any cunning crueltythat can torment him much and hold him longit shall be his you shall close prisoner resttill that

letterswhen you shall these unlucky deeds relatespeak of me as I am nothing extenuatenor set down aught in malice then must you speakof one that loved not wisely but too wellof one not easily

tears as fast as the Arabian treestheir mednable gum Set you down thisand say besides that in Aleppo oncewhere a malignant and a turbaned Turkbeat a Venetian and traduced the stateI took by the throat the rcumsed dogand smote him thusO bloody periodall thats spoke is marredI kissed thee ere I killed thee no way but thiskilling myself to die upon a kissthis did I fear but thought he had no weaponfor he was great of heartO Spartan dogmore fell than anguish hunger or the sealook on the tragic loading of this bedthis is thy work the object poisons sightlet it be hid Gratiano keep

neighbour-stained steelwill they not hear what ho you men you beaststhat quench the fire of your pernious ragewith purple fountains issuing from your veinson pain of torture from those bloody handsthrow your mis-tempered weapons to the groundand hear the sentence of your moved princethree civil brawls bred of an airy wordby thee old Capulet and Montaguehave thrice disturbed the quiet of our streetsand made Veronas anent tizenscast by their grave beseeming ornamentsto wield old partisans in hands as oldcankered with peace to part your cankered hateif ever you disturb our streets againyour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peacefor this time all the rest depart awayyou Capulet shall go along with meand Montague come you this afternoonto know our further pleasure

of your adversaryand yours close fighting ere I did approachI drew to part them in the instant camethe fiery Tybalt with his sword preparedwhich as he breathed defiance to my earshe swung about his head and cut the windswho nothing hurt withal hissed him in scornwhile we were interchanging thrusts and blowscame more and more and fought on part and parttill the prince came who parted either partO where is Romeo saw you him to-dayright glad I am he was not at this fraymadam an hour before the worshipped sunpeered forth the golden window of the easta troubled mind drave me to walk abroadwhere underneath the grove of sycamorethat westward rooteth from the tys sideso early walking did I see your sontowards him I made but he was ware of meand stole into the covert of the woodI measuring his affections by my ownthat most are busied when theyre most alonepursued my humour not pursuing hisand gladly shunned who gladly fled from memany a morning hath he there been seenwith tears augmenting the fresh mornings dewadding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighsbut all so soon as the all-cheering sunshould in the furthest east begin to drawthe shady curtains from Auroras bedaway from light steals home my heavy sonand private in his chamber pens himselfshuts up his windows locks fair daylight outand makes himself an artifial nightblack and portentous must this humour proveunless good-counsel may the cause removemy noble uncle do you know the causeI neither know it nor can learn of himhave you importuned him by any meansboth by myself and many other friendsbut he his own affections counselloris to himself I will not say how truebut to himself so secret and so closeso far from sounding and discoveryas is the bud bit with an envious wormere he can spread his sweet leaves to the airor dedicate his beauty to the suncould we but learn from whence his sorrows growwe would as willingly give cure as knowsee where he comes so please you step asideiull know his grievance or be much deniedI would thou wert so happy by thy stayto hear true shrift come madam lets awaygood morrow cousinis the day so youngbut new struck

where I am in lovealas that love so gentle in his viewshould be so tyrannous and rough in proofalas that love whose view is muffled stillshould without eyes see pathways to his willwhere shall we dine O me what fray was hereyet tell me not for I have heard it allheres much to do with hate but more with lovewhy then O brawling love O loving hateO any thing of nothing first createO heavy lightness serious vanitymis-shapen chaos of well-seeming formsfeather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick healthstill-waking sleep that is not what it isthis love feel I that feel no love in thisdost thou not laughno coz I rather weepgood heart at whatat thy good hearts oppressionwhy such is loves transgressiongriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breastwhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressedwith more of thine this love that thou hast showndoth add more grief to too much of mine ownlove is a smoke raised with the fume of sighsbeing purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyesbeing vexed a sea nourished with lovers tearswhat is it else a madness most discreeta choking gall and a preserving sweetfarewell my cozsoft I will go alongan if you leave me so you do me wrongtut I have lost myself I am not herethis is not Romeo hes some other wheretell me in sadness who is that you lovewhat shall I groan and tell theegroan why nobut sadly tell me whobid a sick

unharmedshe will not stay the siege of loving termsnor bide the encounter of assailing eyesnor ope her lap to saint-sedung goldO she is rich in beauty only poorthat when she dies with beauty dies her storethen she hath sworn that she will still live chasteshe hath and in that sparing makes huge wastefor beauty starved with her severitycuts beauty off from all posterityshe is too fair too wise wisely too fairto merit bliss by making me despairshe hath forsworn to love and in that vowdo I live dead that live to tell it nowbe ruled by me forget to think of herO teach me how I should forget to thinkby giving liberty unto thine eyesexamine other beautiesitis the wayto call hers exquisite in question morethese happy masks that kiss fair ladies browsbeing black put us in mind

who passed that passing fairfarewell thou canst not teach me to forgetiull pay that doctrine or else die in debtbut Montague is bound as well as Iin penalty alike and itis not hard I thinkfor men

boundI cannot bound a pitch above dull woeunder loves heavy burden do I sinkand to sink in it should you burden lovetoo great oppression for a tender thingis love a tender thing it is too roughtoo rude too boisterous and it pricks like thornif love be rough with you be rough with loveprick love for pricking and you beat love downgive me a case to put my visage ina visor for a visor what care Iwhat curious eye doth quote deformitieshere are the beetle brows shall blush for mecome knock and enter and no sooner inbut every man betake him to his legsa torch for me let

delaywe waste our lights in vain like lamps by daytake our good meaning for our judgment sitsfive times in that ere once in our five witsand we mean well in going to this masquebut itis no wit to gowhy may one askI dreamed a dream to-nightand so did Iwell what was yoursthat dreamers often liein bed asleep while they do dream things trueO then I see queen Mab hath been with youqueen Mab whats sheshe is the fairies midwife and she comesin shape no bigger than an agate-stoneon the fore-finger of an aldermandrawn with a team of little atomiesathwart mens noses as they lie asleepher waggon-spokes made of long spinners legsthe cover of the wings of grasshoppersthe traces of the smallest spiders webthe collars of the moonshines watery beamsher whip of crickets bone the lash of filmher waggoner a small grey-coated gnatnot half so big as a round little wormpricked from the lazy finger of a maidher chariot is an empty hazel-nutmade by the joiner squirrel or old grubtime out o mind the fairies coach-makersand in this state she gallops night by nightthrough lovers brains and then they dream of loveoer courtiers knees that dream on curtsies straightoer lawyers fingers who straight dream on feesoer ladies lips who straight on kisses dreamwhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plaguesbecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted aresometimes she gallops oer a courtiers noseand then dreams he of smelling out a suitand sometimes comes she with a tithe pigs tailtickling a parsons nose as a lies asleepthen dreams he of another beneficesometime she driveth oer a soldiers neckand then dreams he of cutting foreign throatsof breaches ambuscadoes Spanish bladedof healths five fathom deep and then anondrums in his ear at which he starts and wakesand being thus frighted swears a prayer or twoand sleeps again this is that very Mabthat plats the manes of horses in the nightand bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairswhich once untangled much misfortune bodesthis is the hag when maids lie on their backsthat presses them and learns them first to bearmaking them women of good carriagethis is shepeace peace Mercutio peacethou talkest of nothingtrue I talk of dreamswhich are the children of an idle brainbegot of nothing but vain fantasywhich is as thin of substance as the airand more inconstant than the wind who wooseven now the frozen bosom of the northand being angered puffs away from thenceturning his face to the dew-dropping souththis wind you talk of blows us from ourselvessupper is done and we shall come too lateI fear too early for my mind misgivessome consequence yet hanging in the starsshall bitterly begin his fearful datewith this nights revels and expire the termof a despised life closed in my breastby some vile forfeit of untimely deathbut he that hath the steerage of my coursedirect my sail on lusty gentlemenstrike drumwheres Potpan that he helps not to take away he shift a trencher he scrape a trencherwhen good manners shall lie all in one or two mens hands and they unwashed too itis a foul thingaway with the joint-stools

bewitched by the charm of looksbut to his foe supposed he must complainand she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooksbeing held a foe he may not have accessto breathe such vows as lovers used to swearand she as much in love her means much lessto meet her new-beloved any wherebut passion lends them power time means to meettempering extremity with extreme sweetcan I go forward when my heart is hereturn back dull earth and find thy centre outRomeo my cousin Romeohe is wiseand on my life hath stoln him home to bedhe ran this way and leaped this orchard wallcall good

dead and I must conjure himI conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyesby her high forehead and her scarlet lipby her fine foot straight leg and quivering thighand the demesnes that there adjacent liethat in thy likeness thou appear to usan if he hear thee thou wilt anger himthis cannot anger him twould anger himto raise a spirit in his mistress rcleof some strange nature letting it there standtill she had laid it and conjured it downthat were some spite my invocationis fair and honest and in his mistress nameI conjure only but to raise up himcome he hath hid himself among these treesto be consorted with the humorous nightblind is his love and best befits the darkif love be blind love cannot hit the marknow will he sit under a medlar treeand wish his mistress were that kind of fruitas maids call medlars when they laugh aloneO Romeo that she were O that she werean open etcetera thou a poperin pearRomeo good night iull to my truckle-bedthis field-bed is too cold for me to sleepcome shall we gogo then for itis in vainto seek him here that means not to be foundhe jests at scars that never felt a woundbut soft what light through yonder window breaksit is the east and Juliet is the sunarise fair sun and kill the envious moonwho is already sick and pale with griefthat thou her maid art far more fair than shebe not her maid since she is enviousher vestal livery is but sick and greenand none but fools do wear it cast it offit is my lady O it is my loveO that she knew she wereshe speaks yet she says nothing what of thather eye discourses I will answer itI am too bold itis not to me she speakstwo of the fairest stars in all the heavenhaving some business do entreat her eyesto twinkle in their spheres till they returnwhat if her eyes were there they in her headthe brightness of her cheek would shame those starsas daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heavenwould through the airy region stream so brightthat birds would sing and think it were not nightsee how she leans her cheek upon her handO that I were a glove upon that handthat I might touch that cheekay meshe speaksO speak again bright angel for thou artas glorious to this night being oer my headas is a winged messenger of heavenunto the white-upturned wondring eyesof mortals that fall back to gaze on himwhen he bestrides the lazy-pang cloudsand sails upon the bosom of the airO Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeodeny thy father and refuse thy nameor if thou wilt not be but sworn my loveand iull no longer be a Capuletshall I hear more or shall I speak at thisitis but thy name that is my enemythou art thyself though not a Montaguewhats Montague it is nor hand nor footnor arm nor face nor any other partbelonging to a man O be some other namewhats in a name that which we call a roseby any other name would smell as sweetso Romeo would were he not Romeo calledretain that dear perfection which he oweswithout that title Romeo doff thy nameand for that name which is no part of theetake all myselfI take thee at thy wordcall me but love and iull be new baptizedhenceforth I never will be Romeowhat man art thou that thus bescreened in nightso stumblest on my counselby a nameI know not how to tall thee who I ammy name dear saint is hateful to myselfbecause it is an enemy to theehad I it written I would tear the wordmy ears have not yet drunk a hundred wordsof that tongues uttering yet I know the soundart thou not Romeo and a Montagueneither fair maid if either thee dislikehow camest thou hither tell me and whereforethe orchard walls are high and hard to climband the place death considering who thou artif any of my kinsmen find thee herewith loves light wings did I oerperch these wallsfor stony limits cannot hold love outand what love can do that dares love attempttherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to meif they do see thee they will murder theealack there lies more peril in thine eyethan twenty of their swords look thou but sweetand I am proof against their enmityI would not for the world they saw thee hereI have nights cloak to hide me from their eyesand but thou love me let them find me heremy life were better ended by their hatethan death prorogued wanting of thy loveby whose direction foundest thou out this placeby love that first did prompt me to inquirehe lent me counsel and I lent him eyesI am no pilot yet wert thou as faras that vast shore washed with the furthest seaI would adventure for such merchandisethou knowest the mask of night is on my faceelse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekfor that which thou hast heard me speak to-nightfain would I dwell on form fain fain denywhat I have spoke but farewell complimentdost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay and I will take thy word yet if thou swearestthou mayst prove false at lovers perjuriesthey say Jove laughs O gentle Romeoif thou dost love pronounce it faithfullyor if thou thinkest I am too quickly woniull frown and be perverse and say thee nayso thou wilt woo but else not for the worldin truth fair Montague I am too fondand therefore thou mayst think my haviour lightbut trust me gentleman iull prove more truethan those that have more cunning to be strangeI should have been more strange I must confessbut that thou over-heardest ere I was waremy true loves passion therefore pardon meand not impute this yielding to light lovewhich the dark night hath so discoveredlady by yonder blessed moon I swearthat tips with silver all these fruit-tree topsO swear not by the moon the inconstant moonthat monthly changes in her rcled orblest that thy love prove likewise variablewhat shall I swear bydo not swear at allor if thou wilt swear by thy gracious selfwhich is the god of my idolatryand iull believe theeif my hearts dear lovewell do not swear although I joy in theeI have no joy of this contract to-nightit is too rash too unadvised too suddentoo like the lightning which doth cease to beere one can say it lightens sweet good-nightthis bud of love by summers ripening breathmay prove a beauteous flower when next we meetgood-night good-night as sweet repose and restcome to thy heart as that within my breastO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfiedwhat satisfaction canst thou have to-nightthe exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mineI gave thee mine before thou didst request itand yet I would it were to give againwouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose lovebut to be frank and give it thee againand yet I wish but for the thing I havemy bounty is as boundless as the seamy love as deep the more I give to theethe more I have for both are infiniteI hear some noise within dear love adieuanon good nurse sweet Montague be truestay but a little I will come againO blessed blessed night I am afeardbeing in night all this is but a dreamtoo flattering-sweet to be substantialthree words dear Romeo and good-night indeedif that thy bent of love be honourablethy purpose marriage send me word to-morrowby one that iull procure to come to theewhere and what time thou wilt perform the riteand all my fortunes at thy foot iull layand follow thee my lord throughout the worldmadamI come anon but if thou meanest not wellI do beseech theemadamby and by I cometo cease thy suit and leave me to my griefto-morrow will I sendso thrive my soula thousand times good-nighta thousand times the worse to want thy lightlove goes toward love as schoolboys from their booksbut love from love toward school with heavy lookshist Romeo hist O for a falconers voiceto lure this tassel-gentle back againbondage is hoarse and may not speak aloudelse would I tear the cave where echo liesand make her airy tongue more hoarse than minewith repetition of my Romeos nameit is my soul that calls upon my namehow silver-sweet sound lovers tongues by nightlike softest music to attending earsRomeomy dearat what oclock to-morrowshall I send to theeat the hour of nineI will not fail itis twenty years till thenI have forgot why I did call thee backlet me stand here till thou remember itI shall forget to have thee still stand thereremembering how I love thy companyand iull still stay to have thee still forgetforgetting any other home but thisitis almost morning I would have thee goneand yet no further than a wantons birdwho lets it hop a little from her handlike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyvesand with a silk thread plucks it back againso loving-jealous of his libertyI would I were thy birdsweet so would Iyet I should kill thee with much cherishinggood-night good-night parting is such sweet sorrowthat I shall say good-night till it be morrowsleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breastwould I were sleep and peace so sweet to resthence will I to my ghostly fathers cellhis help to crave and my dear hap to tellthe grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning nightchequering the eastern clouds with streaks of lightand flecked darkness like a drunkard reelsfrom forth days path and Titans fiery wheelsnow ere the sun advance his burning eyethe day to cheer and nights dank dew to dryI must up-fill this osier cage of ourswith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowersthe earth thats natures mother is her tombwhat is her burying grave that is her womband from her womb children of divers kindwe sucking on her natural bosom findmany for many virtues excellentnone but for some and yet all differentO mickle is the powerful grace that liesin herbs plants stones and their true qualitiesfor nought so vile that on the earth doth livebut to the earth some speal good doth givenor aught so good but strained from that fair userevolts from true birth stumbling on abusevirtue itself turns vice being misappliedand vice sometimes by action dignifiedwithin the infant rind of this weak flowerpoison hath residence and medine powerfor this being smelt with that part cheers each partbeing tasted slays all senses with the hearttwo such opposed foes encamp them stillin man as well as herbs grace and rude willand where the worser is predominantfull soon the canker death eats up that plantgood morrow fatherbeneditewhat early tongue so sweet saluteth meyoung son it argues a distempered headso soon to bid good morrow to thy bedcare keeps his watch in every old mans eyeand where care lodges sleep will never liebut where unbruised youth with unstuffed braindoth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reigntherefore thy earliness doth me assurethou art up-roused by some distemperatureor if not so then here I hit it rightour Romeo hath not been in bed to-nightthat last is true the sweeter rest was minegod pardon sin wast thou with Rosalinewith Rosaline my ghostly father noI have forgot that name and that names woethats my good son but where hast thou been theniull tell thee ere thou ask it me againI have been feasting with mine enemywhere on a sudden one hath wounded methats by me wounded both our remedieswithin thy help and holy physic liesI bear no hatred blessed man for lomy intercession likewise steads my foebe plain good son and homely in thy driftriddling confession finds but riddling shriftthen plainly know my hearts dear love is seton the fair daughter of rich Capuletas mine on hers so hers is set on mineand all combined save what thou must combineby holy marriage when and where and howwe met we wooed and made exchange of vowiull tell thee as we pass but this I praythat thou consent to marry us to-dayholy Saint Frans what a change is hereis Rosaline whom thou didst love so dearso soon forsaken young mens love then liesnot truly in their hearts but in their eyesjesu Maria what a deal of brinehath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosalinehow much salt water thrown away in wasteto season love that of it doth not tastethe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clearsthy old groans ring yet in my anent earslo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitof an old tear that is not washed off yetif eer thou wast thyself and these woes thinethou and these woes were all for Rosalineand art thou changed pronounce this sentence thenwomen may fall when theres no strength in menthou chiddest me oft for loving Rosalinefor doting not for loving pupil mineand badest me bury lovenot in a graveto lay one in another out to haveI pray thee chide not she whom I love nowdoth grace for grace and love for love allowthe other did not soO she knew wellthy love did read by rote and could not spellbut come young waverer come go with mein one respect iull thy assistant befor this alliance may so happy proveto turn your households rancour to pure loveO let us hence I stand on sudden hastewisely and slow they stumble that run fastwhere the devil should this Romeo became he not home to-nightnot to his fathers I spoke with his manwhy that same pale hard-hearted wench that Rosalinetorments him so that he will sure run madtybalt the kinsman of old Capulethath sent a letter to his fathers housea challenge on my lifeRomeo will answer itany man that can write may answer a letternay he will answer the letters master how he dares being daredalas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boys butt-shaft and is he a man to encounter Tybaltwhy what is Tybaltmore than prince of cats I can tell you O he is the courageous captain of compliments he fights as you sing prick-song keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom the very butcher

holy wordsthen love-devouring death do what he dareit is enough I may but call her minethese violent delights have violent endsand in their triumph die like fire and powderwhich as they kiss

lady O so light a footwill neer wear out the everlasting flinta lover may bestride the gossamerthat idles in the wanton summer airand yet not fall so light is vanitygood even to my ghostly confessorRomeo shall thank thee daughter for us bothas much to him else are his thanks too muchah Juliet if the measure of thy joybe heaped like mine and that thy skill be moreto blazon it then sweeten with thy breaththis neighbour air and let rich musics tongueunfold the imagined happiness that bothreceive in either by this dear encounterconceit more rich in matter than in wordsbrags

brawlfor now these hot days is the mad blood stirringthou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says God send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no needam I like such a fellowcome come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be movedand what tonay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other thou why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with another for tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrellingan I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarterthe fee-simple O simpleby my head here come the Capuletsby my heel I care notfollow me close for I will speak to them gentlemen good den a word with one of youand but one word with one of us Couple it with something make it a word and a blowyou shall find me

iull be hanged sir if he wear your liverymarry go before to field hell be your followeryour worship in that sense may call him man Romeo the hate I bear thee can affordno better term than this thou art a villaintybalt the reason that I have to love theedoth much excuse the appertaining rageto such a greeting villain am I nonetherefore farewell I see thou knowest me notboy this shall not excuse the injuriesthat thou hast done me therefore turn and drawI do protest I never injured theebut love thee better than thou canst devisetill thou shalt know the reason of my loveand so good Capulet which name I tenderas dearly as my own be satisfiedO calm dishonourable vile submissionalla stoccata carries it awaytybalt you rat-catcher will you walkwhat wouldst thou have with megood king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter dry-beat the rest of the eight Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be outI am for yougentle Mercutio put thy rapier upcome sir your passadodraw Benvolio beat down their weaponsgentlemen for shame forbear

death a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic why the devil came you between us I was hurt under your armI thought all for the besthelp me into some house Benvolioor I shall faint a plague o both your housesthey have made worms meat of me I have itand soundly too your housesthis gentleman the princes near allymy very friend hath got his mortal hurtin my behalf my reputation stainedwith Tybalts slander Tybalt that an hourhath been my kinsman O sweet Julietthy beauty hath made me effeminateand in my temper softened valours steelO Romeo Romeo brave Mercutios deadthat gallant spirit hath aspired the cloudswhich too untimely here did scorn the earththis days black fate on more days doth dependthis but begins the woe others must endhere comes the furious Tybalt back againalive in triumph and Mercutio slainaway to heaven respective lenityand fire-eyed fury be my conduct nownow Tybalt take the villain back againthat late thou gavest me for Mercutios soulis but a little way above our headsstaying for thine to keep him companyeither thou or I or both must go with himthou wretched boy that didst consort him hereshalt with him hencethis shall determine thatRomeo away be gonethe tizens are up and Tybalt slainstand not amazed the prince will doom thee deathif thou art taken hence be gone awayO I am fortunes foolwhy dost thou staywhich way ran he that killed Mercutiotybalt that murderer which way ran hethere lies that Tybaltup sir go with meI charge thee in the princes name obeywhere are the vile beginners of this frayO noble prince I can discover allthe unlucky manage of this fatal brawlthere lies the man slain by young Romeothat slew thy kinsman brave Mercutiotybalt my cousin O my brothers childO prince O cousin husband O the blood is spilledof my dear kinsman prince as thou art truefor blood of ours shed blood of MontagueO cousin cousinbenvolio who began this bloody fraytybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slayRomeo that spoke him fair bade him bethinkhow nice the quarrel was and urged withalyour high displeasure all this utteredwith gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowedcould not take truce with the unruly spleenof Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tiltswith pierng steel at bold Mercutios breastwho all as hot turns deadly point to pointand with a martial scorn with one hand beatscold death aside and with the other sendsit back to Tybalt whose dexterityretorts it Romeo he cries aloudhold friends friends part and swifter than his tonguehis agile arm beats down their fatal pointsand btwixt them rushes underneath whose arman envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeof stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fledbut by and by comes back to Romeowho had but newly entertained revengeand to'tthey go like lightning for ere Icould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slainand as he fell did Romeo turn and flythis is the truth or let Benvolio diehe is a kinsman to the Montagueaffection makes him false he speaks not truesome twenty of them fought in this black strifeand all those twenty could but kill one lifeI beg for justice which thou prince must giveRomeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not liveRomeo slew him he slew Mercutiowho now the price of his dear blood doth owenot Romeo prince he was Mercutios friendhis fault concludes but what the law should endthe life of Tybaltand for that offenceimmediately we do exile him henceI have an interest in your hates proceedingmy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleedingbut iull amerce you with so strong a finethat you shall all repent the loss of mineI will be deaf to pleading and excusesnor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abusestherefore use none let Romeo hence in hasteelse when hes found that hour is his lastbear hence this body and attend our willmercy but murders pardoning those that killgallop apace you fiery-footed steedstowards Phoebus lodging such a waggoneras Phaethon would whip you to the westand bring in cloudy night immediatelyspread thy close curtain love-performing nightthat runaways eyes may wink and Romeoleap to these arms untalked of and unseenlovers can see to do their amorous ritesby their own beauties or if love be blindit best agrees with night come civil nightthou sober-suited matron all in blackand learn me how to lose a winning matchplayed for a pair of stainless maidenhoodshood my unmanned blood bating in my cheekswith thy black mantle till strange love grown boldthink true love acted simple modestycome night come Romeo come thou day in nightfor thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightwhiter than new snow on a ravens backcome gentle night come loving black-browed nightgive me my Romeo and when he shall dietake him and cut him out in little starsand he will make the face of heaven so finethat all the world will be in love with nightand pay no worship to the garish sunO I have bought the mansion of a lovebut not possessed it and though I am soldnot yet enjoyed so tedious is this dayas is the night before some festivalto an impatient child that hath new robesand may not wear them O here comes my nurseand she brings news and every tongue that speaksbut Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquencenow nurse what news what hast thou there the cordsthat Romeo bade thee fetchay ay the cordsah me what news why dost thou wring thy handsah well-a-day hes dead hes dead hes deadwe are undone lady we are undonealack the day hes gone hes killed hes deadcan heaven be so enviousRomeo canthough heaven cannot O Romeo Romeowho ever would have thought it Romeowhat devil art thou that dost torment me thusthis torture should be roared in dismal hellhath Romeo slain himself say thou but I and that bare vowel I shall poison morethan the death-darting eye of cockatriceI am not I if there be such an I or those eyes shut that make thee answer I if he be slain say I or if not no brief sounds determine of my weal or woeI saw the wound I saw it with mine eyesgod save the mark here on his manly breasta piteous corse a bloody piteous corsepale pale as ashes all bedaubed in bloodall in gore blood I swounded at the sightO break my heart poor bankrupt break at onceto prison eyes neer look on libertyvile earth to earth resign end motion hereand thou and Romeo press one heavy bierO Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I hadO courteous Tybalt honest gentlemanthat ever I should live to see thee deadwhat storm is this that blows so contraryis Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt deadmy dearest cousin and my dearer lordthen dreadful trumpet sound the general doomfor who is living if those two are gonetybalt is gone and Romeo banishedRomeo that killed him he is banishedO God did Romeos hand shed Tybalts bloodit did it did alas the day it didO serpent heart hid with a flowering facedid ever dragon keep so fair a cavebeautiful tyrant fiend angelicaldove-feathered raven wolvish-ravening lambdespised substance of divinest showjust opposite to what thou justly seemesta damned saint an honourable villainO nature what hadst thou to do in hellwhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendin mortal paradise of such sweet fleshwas ever book containing such vile matterso fairly bound O that deceit should dwellin such a gorgeous palacetheres no trustno faith no honesty in men all naughtall perjured all dissemblers all forswornah wheres my man give me some aqua vitthese griefs these woes these sorrows make me oldshame come to Romeoblistered be thy tonguefor such a wish he was not born to shameupon his brow shame is ashamed to sitfor itis a throne where honour may be crownedsole monarch of the universal earthO what a beast was I to chide at himwill you speak well of him that killed your cousinshall I speak ill of him that is my husbandah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy namewhen I thy three-hours wife have mangled itbut wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousinthat villain cousin would have killed my husbandback foolish tears back to your native springyour tributary drops belong to woewhich you mistaking offer up to joymy husband lives that Tybalt would have slainand Tybalts dead that would have slain my husbandall this is comfort wherefore weep I thensome word there was worser than Tybalts deaththat murdered me I would forget it fainbut O it presses to my memorylike damned guilty deeds to sinners mindstybalt is dead and Romeo banished that banished that one word banished hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts deathwas woe enough if it had ended thereor if sour woe delights in fellowshipand needly will be ranked with other griefswhy followed not when she said Tybalts dead thy father or thy mother nay or bothwhich modern lamentation might have movedbut with a rearward following Tybalts deathRomeo is banished to speak that wordis father mother Tybalt Romeo Julietall slain all dead Romeo is banished there is no end no limit measure boundin that words death no words can that woe soundwhere is my father and my mother nurseweeping and wailing over Tybalts corsewill you go to them I will bring you thitherwash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spentwhen theirs are dry for Romeos banishmenttake up those cords poor ropes you are beguiledboth you and I for Romeo is exiledhe made you for a highway to my bedbut I a maid die maiden-widowedcome cords come nurse iull to my wedding bedand death not Romeo take my maidenheadhie to your chamber iull find Romeoto comfort you I wot well where he ishark ye your Romeo will be here to-nightiull to him he is hid at Laurence cellO find him give this ring to my true knightand bid him come to take his last farewellRomeo come forth come forth thou fearful manaffliction is enamoured of thy partsand thou art wedded to calamityfather what news what is the princes doomwhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my handthat I yet know nottoo familiaris my dear son with such sour companyI bring thee tidings of the princes doomwhat less than doomsday is the princes dooma gentler judgment vanished from his lipsnot bodys death but bodys banishmentha banishment be merful say edeath for exile hath more terror in his lookmuch more than death do not say banishment hence from Verona art thou banishedbe patient for the world is broad and widethere is no world without Verona wallsbut purgatory torture hell itselfhence banished is banished from the worldand worlds exile is death then banished is death mis-termed calling death banished thou cuttest my head off with a golden axeand smilest upon the stroke that murders meO deadly sin O rude unthankfulnessthy fault our law calls death but the kind princetaking thy part hath rushed aside the lawand turned that black word death to banishmentthis is dear mercy and thou seest it notitis torture and not mercy heaven is herewhere Juliet lives and every cat and dogand little mouse every unworthy thinglive here in heaven and may look on herbut Romeo may not more validitymore honourable state more courtship livesin carrion flies than Romeo they may seizeon the white wonder of dear Juliets handand steal immortal blessing from her lipswho even in pure and vestal modestystill blush as thinking their own kisses sinflies may do this but I from this must flythey are free men but I am banishedand sayst thou yet that exile is not deathhadst thou no poison mixed no sharp-ground knifeno sudden mean of death though neer so meanbut banished to kill mebanished O friar the damned use that word in hellhowlings attend it how hast thou the heartbeing a divine a ghostly confessora sin-absolver and my friend professedto mangle me with that word banished thou fond mad man hear me but speak a wordO thou wilt speak again of banishmentiull give thee armour to keep off that wordadversitys sweet milk philosophyto comfort thee though thou art banishedyet banished hang up philosophyunless philosophy can make a Julietdisplant a town reverse a princes doomit helps not it prevails not talk no moreO then I see that madmen have no earshow should they when that wise men have no eyeslet me dispute with thee of thy estatethou canst not speak of that thou dost not feelwert thou as young as I Juliet thy lovean hour but married Tybalt murdereddoting like me and like me banishedthen mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hairand fall upon the ground as I do nowtaking the measure of an unmade gravearise one knocks good Romeo hide thyselfnot I unless the breath of heart-sick groansmist-like infold me from the search of eyeshark how they knock whos there Romeo arisethou wilt be taken Stay awhile Stand uprun to my study by and by Gods willwhat wilfulness is this I come I comewho knocks so hard whence come you whats your willlet me come in and you shall know my errandI come from Lady Julietwelcome thenO holy friar O tell me holy friarwhere is my ladys lord wheres Romeothere on the ground with his own tears made drunkO he is even in my mistress casejust in her caseO woeful sympathypiteous predicament even so lies sheblubbering and weeping weeping and blubberingstand up stand up stand an you be a manfor Juliets sake for her sake rise and standwhy should you fall into so deep an Onurseah sir ah sir well deaths the end of allspakest thou of Juliet how is it with herdoth she not think me an old murderernow I have stained the childhood of our joywith blood removed but little from her ownwhere is she and how doth she and what saysmy concealed lady to our cancelled loveO she says nothing sir but weeps and weepsand now falls on her bed and then starts upand Tybalt calls and then on Romeo criesand then down falls againas if that nameshot from the deadly level of a gundid murder her as that names cursed handmurdered her kinsman O tell me friar tell mein what vile part of this anatomydoth my name lodge tell me that I may sackthe hateful mansionhold thy desperate handart thou a man thy form cries out thou artthy tears are womanish thy wild acts denotethe unreasonable fury of a beastunseemly woman in a seeming manor ill-beseeming beast in seeming boththou hast amazed me by my holy orderI thought thy disposition better temperedhast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyselfand slay thy lady that in thy life livesby doing damned hate upon thyselfwhy railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earthsince birth and heaven and earth all three do meetin thes at once which thou at once wouldst losefie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy witwhich like a usurer aboundest in alland usest none in that true use indeedwhich should bedeck thy shape thy love thy witthy noble shape is but a form of waxdigressing from the valour of a manthy dear love sworn but hollow perjurykilling that love which thou hast vowed to cherishthy wit that ornament to shape and lovemisshapen in the conduct of them bothlike powder in a skilless soldiers flaskto set a-fire by thine own ignoranceand thou dismembered with thine own defencewhat rouse thee man thy Juliet is alivefor whose dear sake thou wast but lately deadthere art thou happy Tybalt would kill theebut thou slewest Tybalt there art thou happy toothe law that threatened death becomes thy friendand

lovetake heed take heed for such die miserablego get thee to thy love as was decreedascend her chamber hence and comfort herbut look thou stay not till the watch be setfor then thou canst not

hast thou not a word of joysome comfort nursefaith here it is Romeois banished and all the world to nothingthat he dares neer come back to challenge youor if he do it needs must be by stealththen since the case so stands as now it dothI think it best you married with the countyO hes a lovely gentlemanRomeos a dishclout to him an eagle madamhath not so green so quick so fair an eyeas Paris hath beshrew my very heartI think you are happy in this second matchfor it excels your first or if it did notyour first is dead or itwere as good he wereas living here and you no use of himspeakest thou from thy heartand from my soul tooor else beshrew them bothamenwhatwell thou hast comforted me marvellous muchgo in and tell my lady I am gonehaving displeased my father to Laurence cellto make confession and to be absolvedmarry I will and this is wisely doneanent damnation O most wicked fiendis it more sin to wish me thus forswornor to dispraise my lord with that same tonguewhich she hath praised him with above compareso many thousand times go counsellorthou and my bosom henceforth shall be twainiull to the friar to know his remedyif all else fail myself have power to dieon Thursday sir the time is very shortmy father Capulet will have it soand I am nothing slow to slack his hasteyou say you do not know the ladys minduneven is the course I like it notimmoderately she weeps for Tybalts deathand therefore have I little talked of lovefor Venus smiles not in a house of tearsnow sir her father counts it dangerousthat she doth give her sorrow so much swayand in his wisdom hastes our marriageto stop the inundation of her tearswhich too much minded by herself alonemay be put from her by societynow do you know the reason of this hasteI would I knew not why it should be slowedlook sir here comes the lady towards my cellhappily met my lady and my wifethat may be sir when I may be a wifethat may be must be love on Thursday nextwhat must be shall bethats a certain textcome you to make confession to this fatherto answer that I should confess to youdo not deny to him that you love meI will confess to you that I love himso will ye I am sure that you love meif I do so it will be of more pricebeing spoke behind your back than to your facepoor soul thy face is much abused with tearsthe tears have got small victory by thatfor it was bad enough before their spitethou wrongest it more than tears with that reportthat is no slander sir which is a truthand what I spake I spake it to my facethy face is mine and thou hast slandered itit may be so for it is not mine ownare you at leisure holy father nowor shall I come to you at evening massmy leisure serves me pensive daughter nowmy lord we must entreat the time alonegod shield I should disturb devotionjuliet on Thursday early will I rouse youtill then adieu and keep this holy kissO shut the door and when thou hast done socome weep with me past hope past cure past helpah Juliet I already know thy griefit strains me past the compass of my witsI hear thou must and nothing may prorogue iton Thursday next be married to this countytell me not friar that thou hearest of thisunless thou tell me how I may prevent itif in thy wisdom thou canst give no helpdo thou but call my resolution wiseand with this knife iull help it presentlygod joined my heart and Romeos thou our handsand ere this hand by thee to Romeo sealedshall be the label to another deedor my true heart with treacherous revoltturn to another this shall slay them boththerefore out of thy long-experienced timegive me some present counsel or beholdbtwixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeshall play the umpire arbitrating thatwhich the commission of thy years and artcould to no issue of true honour bringbe not so long to speak I long to dieif what thou speakest speak not of remedyhold daughter I do spy a kind of hopewhich craves as desperate an executionas that is desperate which we would preventif rather than to marry County Paristhou hast the strength of will to slay thyselfthen is it likely thou wilt undertakea thing like death to chide away this shamethat copest with death himself to scape from itand if thou darest iull give thee remedyO bid me leap rather than marry Parisfrom off the battlements of yonder toweror walk in thievish ways or bid me lurkwhere serpents are chain me with roaring bearsor shut me nightly in a charnel-houseoer-covered quite with dead mens rattling boneswith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skullsor bid me go into a new-made graveand hide me with a dead man in his shroudthings that to hear them told have made me trembleand I will do it without fear or doubtto live an unstained wife to my sweet lovehold then go home be merry give consentto marry Paris Wednesday is to-morrowto-morrow night look that thou lie alonelet not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chambertake thou this vial being then in bedand this distilled liquor drink thou offwhen presently through all thy veins shall runa cold and drowsy humour for no pulseshall keep his native progress but surceaseno warmth no breath shall testify thou livestthe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeto paly ashes thy eyes windows falllike death when he shuts up the day of lifeeach part deprived of supple governmentshall stiff and stark and cold appear like deathand in this borrowed likeness of shrunk deaththou shalt continue two-and-forty hoursand then awake as from a pleasant sleepnow when the bridegroom in the morning comesto rouse thee from thy bed there art thou deadthen as the manner of our country isin thy best robes uncovered on the bierthou shalt be borne to that same anent vaultwhere all the kindred of the Capulets liein the mean time against thou shalt awakeshall Romeo by my letters know our driftand hither shall he come and he and Iwill watch thy waking and that very nightshall Romeo bear thee hence to mantuaand this shall free thee from this present shameif no unconstant toy nor womanish fearabate thy valour in the acting itgive me give me O tell me not of fearhold get you gone be strong and prosperousin this resolve iull send a friar with speedto mantua with my letters to thy lordlove give me strength and strength shall help affordfarewell dear fatherso many guests invite as here are writsirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooksyou shall have none ill sir foriull try if they can lick their

before to RomeoI fear it is and yet methinks it should notfor he hath still been tried a holy manI will not entertain so bad a thoughthow if when I am laid into the tombI wake before the time that Romeocome to redeem me theres a fearful pointshall I not then be stifled in the vaultto whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes inand there die strangled ere my Romeo comesor if I live is it not very likethe horrible conceit of death and nighttogether with the terror of the placeas in a vault an anent receptaclewhere for these many hundred years the bonesof all my buried ancestors are packedwhere bloody Tybalt yet but green in earthlies festering in his shroud where as they sayat some hours in the night spirits resortalack alack is it not like that Iso early waking what with loathsome smellsand shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earththat living mortals hearing them run madO if I wake shall I not be distraughtenvironed with all these hideous fearsand madly play with my forefathers jointsand pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroudand in this rage with some great kinsmans boneas with a club dash out my desperate brainsO look methinks

lord sits lightly in his throneand all this day an unaccustomed spiritlifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughtsI dreamt my lady came and found me deadstrange dream that gives a dead man leave to thinkand breathed such life with kisses in my lipsthat I revived and was an emperorah me how sweet is love itself possessedwhen but loves shadows are so rich in joynews from Verona how now Balthasardost thou not bring me letters from the friarhow doth my lady is my father wellhow fares my Juliet that I ask againfor nothing can be ill if she be wellthen she is well and nothing

get thee goneand hire those horses iull be with thee straightwell Juliet I will he with thee to-nightlets see for means O mischief thou art swiftto enter in the thoughts of desperate menI do remember an apothecaryand hereabouts he dwells which late I notedin tattered weeds with overwhelming browsculling of simples meagre were his lookssharp misery had worn him to the bonesand in his needy shop a tortoise hungan alligator stuffed and other skinsof ill-shaped fishes and about his shelvesa beggarly account of empty boxesgreen earthen pots bladders and musty seedsremnants of packthread and old cakes of roseswere thinly scattered to make up a shownoting this penury to myself I saidan if a man did need a poison nowwhose sale is present death in mantuahere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it himO this same thought did but fore-run my needand this same needy man must sell it meas I remember this should be the housebeing holiday the beggars shop is shutwhat ho apothecarywho calls so loudcome hither man I see that thou art poorhold there is forty ducats let me havea dram of poison such soon-speeding gearas will disperse itself through all the veinsthat the life-weary taker may fall deadand that the trunk may be discharged of breathas violently as hasty powder fireddoth hurry from the fatal cannons wombsuch mortal drugs I have but mantuas lawis death to any he that utters themart thou so bare and full of wretchednessand fearest to die famine is in thy cheeksneed and oppression starveth in thine eyescontempt and beggary hang upon thy backthe world is not thy friend nor the worlds lawthe world affords no law to make thee richthen be not poor but break it and take thismy poverty but not my will consentsI pay thy poverty and not thy willput this in any liquid thing you willand drink it off and if you had the strengthof twenty men it would dispatch you straightthere is thy gold worse poison to mens soulsdoing more murders in this loathsome worldthan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sellI sell thee poison thou hast sold me nonefarewell buy food and get thyself in fleshcome cordial and not poison go with meto Juliets grave for there must I use theeholy Franscan friar brother hothis same should be the voice of Friar Johnwelcome from mantua what says Romeoor if his mind be writ give me his lettergoing to find a bare-foot brother outone of our order to assoate mehere in this ty visiting the sickand finding him the searchers of the townsuspecting that we both were in a housewhere the infectious pestilence did reignsealed up the doors and would not let us forthso that my speed to mantua there was stayedwho bare my letter then to RomeoI could not send it here it is againnor get a messenger to bring it theeso fearful were they of infectionunhappy fortune by my brotherhoodthe letter was not nice but full of chargeof dear import and the neglecting itmay do much danger Friar John go henceget me an iron crow and bring it straightunto my cellbrother iull go and bring it theenow must I to the monument alonewithin these three hours will fair Juliet wakeshe will beshrew me much that Romeohath had no notice of these acdentsbut I will write again to mantusand keep her at my cell till Romeo comepoor living corse closed in a dead mans tombgive me thy torch boy hence and stand aloofyet put it out for I would not be seenunder yond yew-trees lay thee all alongholding thine ear close to the hollow groundso shall no foot upon the churchyard treadbeing loose unfirm with digging up of gravesbut thou shalt hear it whistle then to meas signal that thou hearest something approachgive me those flowers do as I bid thee goI am almost afraid to stand alonehere in the churchyard yet I will adventuresweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strewO woe thy canopy is dust and stoneswhich with sweet water nightly I will dewor wanting that with tears distilled by moansthe obsequies that I for thee will keepnightly shall be to strew thy grave and weepthe boy gives warning something doth approachwhat cursed foot wanders this way to-nightto cross my obsequies and true loves ritewhat with a torch muffle me night awhilegive me that mattock and the wrenching ironhold take this letter early in the morningsee thou deliver it to my lord and fathergive me the light upon thy life I charge theewhateer thou hearest or seest stand all aloofand do not interrupt me in my coursewhy I descend into this bed of deathis partly to behold my ladys facebut chiefly to take thence from her dead fingera precious ring a ring that I must usein dear employment therefore hence be gonebut if thou jealous dost return to pryin what I further shall intend to doby heaven I will tear thee joint by jointand strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbsthe time and my intents are savage-wildmore fierce and more inexorable farthan empty tigers or the roaring seaI will be gone sir and not trouble youso shalt thou show me friendship take thou thatlive and be prosperous and farewell good fellowfor all this same iull hide me here abouthis looks I fear and his intents I doubtthou detestable maw thou womb of deathgorged with the dearest morsel of the earththus I enforce thy rotten jaws to openand in despite iull cram thee with more foodthis is that banished haughty Montaguethat murdered my loves cousin with which griefit is supposed the fair creature diedand here is come to do some villanous shameto the dead bodies I will apprehend himstop thy unhallowed toil vile Montaguecan vengeance be pursued further than deathcondemned villain I do apprehend theeobey and go with me for thou must dieI must indeed and therefore came I hithergood gentle youth tempt not a desperate manfly hence and leave me think upon these gonelet them affright thee I beseech thee youthput not another sin upon my headby urging me to fury O be goneby heaven I love thee better than myselffor I come hither armed against myselfstay not be gone live and hereafter saya madmans mercy bade thee run awayI do defy thy conjurationsand apprehend thee for a felon herewilt thou provoke me then have at thee boyO lord they fight I will go call the watchO I am slain if thou be merfulopen the tomb lay me with Julietin faith I will let me peruse this facemercutios kinsman noble County Pariswhat said my man when my betossed souldid not attend him as we rode I thinkhe told me Paris should have married Julietsaid he not so or did I dream it soor am I mad hearing him talk of Julietto think it was so O give me thy handone writ with me in sour misfortunes bookiull bury thee in a triumphant gravea grave O no a lanthorn slaughtered youthfor here lies Juliet and her beauty makesthis vault a feasting presence full of lightdeath lie thou there by a dead man interredhow oft when men are at the

was coming from this churchyard sidea great suspion stay the friar toowhat misadventure is so early upthat calls our person from our mornings restwhat should it be that they so shriek abroadthe

breathwhat further woe conspires against mine agelook and thou shalt seeO thou untaught what manners is in thisto press before thy father to a graveseal up the mouth of outrage for a whiletill we can clear these ambiguitiesand know their spring their head their true descentand then will I be general of your woesand lead you even to death meantime forbearand let mischance be slave to patiencebring forth the parties of suspionI am the greatest able to do leastyet most suspected as the time and placedoth make against me of this direful murderand here I stand both to impeach and purgemyself condemned and myself excusedthen say at once what thou dost know in thisI will be brief for my short date of breathis not so long as is a tedious taleRomeo there dead was husband to that Julietand she there dead that Romeos faithful wifeI married them and their stolen marriage-daywas Tybalts doomsday whose untimely deathbanished the new-made bridegroom from this tyfor whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pinedyou to remove that siege of grief from herbetrothed and would have married her perforceto County Paris then comes she to meand with wild looks bid me devise some meanto rid her from this second marriageor in my cell there would she kill herselfthen gave I her so tutored by my arta sleeping potion which so took effectas I intended for it wrought on herthe form of death meantime I writ to Romeothat he should hither come as this dire nightto help to take her from her borrowed gravebeing the time the potions force should ceasebut he which bore my letter Friar Johnwas stayed by acdent and yesternightreturned my letter back then all aloneat the prefixed hour of her wakingcame I to take her from her kindreds vaultmeaning to keep her closely at my celltill I conveniently could send to Romeobut when I came some minute ere the timeof her awakening here untimely laythe noble Paris and true Romeo deadshe wakes and I entreated her come forthand bear this work of heaven with patiencebut then a noise did scare me from the tomband she too desperate would not go with mebut as it seems did violence on herselfall this I know and to the marriageher nurse is privy and if aught in thismiscarried by my fault let my old lifebe sacrificed some hour before his timeunto the rigour of severest lawwe still have known thee for a holy manwheres Romeos man what can he say in thisI brought my master news of Juliets deathand then in post he came from mantuato this same place to this same monumentthis letter he early bid me give his fatherand threatened me with death going in the vaultif I departed not and left him theregive me the letter I will look on itwhere is the countys page that raised the watchsirrah what made your master in this placehe came with flowers to strew his ladys graveand bid me stand aloof and so I didanon comes one with light to ope the tomband by and by my master drew on himand then I ran away to call the watchthis letter doth make good the friars wordstheir course of love the tidings of her deathand here he writes that he did buy a poisonof a poor pothecary and therewithalcame to this vault to die and lie with Julietwhere be these enemies Capulet Montaguesee what a scourge is laid upon your hatethat heaven finds means to kill your joys with loveand I for winking at your discords toohave lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishedO brother Montague give me thy handthis is my daughters jointure for no morecan I demandbut I can give thee morefor I will raise her statue in pure goldthat while Verona by that name is knownthere shall no figure at such rate be setas that of true and faithful Julietas rich shall Romeo by his lady liepoor sacrifices of our enmitya glooming peace this morning with it bringsthe sun for sorrow will not show his headgo hence to have more talk of these sad thingssome shall be pardoned and some punishedfor never was a story of more woethan this of Juliet and her Romeogood day sirI am glad youre wellI have not seen you long how goes the worldit wears sir as it growsay thats well knownbut what particular

I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should neer have need of em they were the most needless creatures living should we neer have use for em and would most resemble

poisonous spite and envywho lives thats not depraved or depraveswho dies that bears not one spurn to their gravesof their friends giftI should fear those that dance before me nowwould one day

walk near iull speak with you anonyou make me marvel wherefore ere this timehad you not fully laid my state before methat I might so have rated my expenseas I had leave of meansyou would not hear meat many leisures I proposedgo toperchance some single vantages you tookwhen my indisposition put you backand that unaptness made your ministerthus to excuse yourselfO my good lordat many times I brought in my accountslaid them before you you would throw them offand say you found them in mine honestywhen for some trifling present you have bid mereturn so much I have shook my head and weptyea gainst the authority of manners prayed youto hold your hand more close I did endurenot seldom nor no slight checks when I haveprompted you in the ebb of your estateand your great flow of debts my loved lordthough you hear now too late yet nows a timethe greatest of your having lacks a halfto pay your present debtslet all my land be solditis all engaged some forfeited and goneand what remains will hardly stop the mouthof present dues the future comes apacewhat shall defend the interim and at lengthhow goes our reckoningto Laced mon did my land extendO my good lord the world is but a wordwere it all yours to give it in a breathhow quickly were it goneyou tell me trueif you suspect my husbandry or falsehoodcall me before the exactest auditorsand set me on the proof so the gods bless mewhen all our offices have been oppressedwith riotous feeders when our vaults have weptwith drunken spilth of wine when every roomhath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsyI have retired me to a wasteful cockand set mine eyes at flowprithee no moreheavens have I said the bounty of this lordhow many prodigal bits have slaves and peasantsthis night englutted who is not Timonswhat heart head sword force means but is lord Timonsgreat Timon noble worthy royal Timonah when the means are gone that buy this praisethe breath is gone whereof this praise is madefeast-won fast-lost one cloud of winter showersthese flies are couchedcome sermon me no furtherno villanous bounty yet hath passed my heartunwisely not ignobly have I givenwhy dost thou weep Canst thou the consence lackto think I shall lack friends Secure thy heartif I would broach the vessels of my loveand try the argument of hearts by borrowingmen and mens fortunes could I frankly useas I can bid thee speakassurance bless your thoughtsand in some sort these wants of mine are crownedthat I account them blessings for by theseshall I try friends you shall perceive how youmistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friendswithin there Flaminius Serviliusmy lord my lordI will dispatch you severally you to lord Luus to lord Lucullus you I hunted with his honour to-day you to Sempronius commend me to their loves and I am proud say that my occasions have found time to use them toward a supply of money let the request be fifty talentsas you have said my lordlord Luus and Lucullus humgo you sir to the senatorsof whom even to the states best health I havedeserved this hearing bid em send ofthe instanta thousand talents to meI have been boldfor that I knew it the most general wayto them to use your signet and your namebut they do shake their heads and I am hereno richer in returnisit true cant bethey answer in a joint and corporate voicethat now they are at fall want treasure cannotdo what they would are sorry you are honourablebut yet they could have wished they know notsomething hath been amiss a noble naturemay catch a wrench would all were well itis pityand so intending other serious mattersafter distasteful looks and these hard fractionswith certain half-caps and cold-moving nodsthey froze me into silenceyou gods reward themprithee man look cheerly these old fellowshave their ingratitude in them hereditarytheir blood is caked itis cold it seldom flowsitis lack of kindly warmth they are not kindand nature as it grows again toward earthis fashioned for the journey dull and heavyprithee be not sadthou art true and honest ingenuously I speakno blame belongs to theeventidius latelyburied his father by whose death hes steppedinto a great estate when he was poorimprisoned and in scarty of friendsI cleared him with five talents greet him from mebid him suppose some good necessitytouches his friend which craves to be rememberedwith those five talentsthat had givet these fellowsto whom itis instant due neer speak or thinkthat Timons fortunes mong his friends can sinkI would I could not think it that thought is bountys foebeing free itself it thinks all others soI have told my lord of you he is coming down to youI thank you sirheres my lordone of lord Timons men a gift I warrant why this hits right I dreamt of a silver bason and ewer to-night Flaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir fill me some wine [exit Servant ] and how does that honourable complete free-hearted gentleman of Athens thy very bountiful good lord and masterhis health is well sirI am right glad that his health is well sir and what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminiusfaith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lords behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance thereinnothing doubting says he Alas good lord a noble gentleman itis if he would not keep so good a house many a time and often I ha dined with him and told him onit and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha told him onit but I could neer get him from itplease your lordship here is the wineflaminius I have noted thee always wise heres to theeyour lordship speaks your pleasureI have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well good parts in theeget you gone sirrah draw nearer honest Flaminius thy lords a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou knowest well enough although thou comest to me that this is no time to lend money espeally upon bare friendship without security heres three solidares for thee good boy wink at me and say thou sawest me not fare thee wellisit possible the world should so much differand we alive that lived fly damned basenessto him that worships theeha now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy mastermay these add to the number that may scald theelet molten coin be thy damnationthou disease of a friend and not himselfhas friendship such a faint and milky heartit turns in less than two nights O you godsI feel my masters passion this slave unto his honourhas my lords meat in himwhy should it thrive and turn to nutrimentwhen he is turned to poisonO may diseases only work uponitand when hes sick to death let not that part of naturewhich my lord paid for be of any powerto expel sickness but prolong his hourwho the lord Timon he is my very good friend and an honourable gentlemanwe know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now lord Timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from himfie no do not believe it he cannot want for moneybut believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely forit and showed what necessity belonged to't and yet was deniedhowI tell you denied my lordwhat a strange case was that now before the gods I am ashamed onit denied that honourable man there was very little honour showed init for my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should neer have denied his occasion so many talentssee by good hap yonders my lord I have sweat to see his honourmy honoured lordservilius you are kindly met sir fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friendmay it please your honour my lord hath sentha what has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord hes ever sending how shall I thank him thinkest thou and what has he sent nowhe has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talentsI know his lordship is but merry with mehe cannot want fifty-five hundred talentsbut in the mean time he wants less my lordif his occasion were not virtuousI should not urge it half so faithfullydost thou speak seriously Serviliusupon my soul itis true sirwhat a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha shown myself honourable how unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to do the more beast I say I was sending to use lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind and tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to himyes sir I shalliull look you out a good turn Serviliustrue as you said Timon is shrunk indeedand he thats once denied will hardly speeddo you observe this Hostiliusay too wellwhy this is the worlds soul and just of the same pieceis every flatterers spirit who can call himhis friend that dips in the same dish for inmy knowing Timon has been this lords fatherand kept his credit with his pursesupported his estate nay Timons moneyhas paid his men their wages he neer drinksbut Timons silver treads upon his lipand yet O see the monstrousness of manwhen he looks out in an ungrateful shapehe does deny him in respect of hiswhat charitable men afford to beggarsreligion groans at itfor mine own partI never tasted Timon in my lifenor came any of his bounties over meto mark me for his friend yet I protestfor his right noble mind illustrious virtueand honourable carriagehad his necessity made use of meI would have put my wealth into donationand the best half should have returned to himso much I love his heart but I perceivemen must learn now with pity to dispensefor policy sits above consencemust he needs trouble me init hum bove all othershe might have tried lord Luus or Lucullusand now Ventidius is wealthy toowhom he redeemed from prison all theseowe their estates unto himmy lordthey have all been touched and found base metal forthey have all denied himhow have they denied himhave Ventidius and Lucullus denied himand does he send to me Three humit shows but little love or judgment in himmust I be his last refuge his friends like physiansthrice give him over must I take the cure upon mehe has much disgraced me init im angry at himthat might have known my place I see no sense foritbut his occasions might have wooed me firstfor in my consence I was the first manthat eer received gift from himand does he think so backwardly of me nowthat iull requite it last noso it may prove an argument of laughterto the rest and I amongst lords be thought a foolI had rather than the worth of thrice the sumhe had sent to me first but for my minds sakeied such a courage to do him good but now returnand with their faint reply this answer joinwho bates mine honour shall not know my coinexcellent your lordships a goodly villain the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by'tand I cannot think but in the end the villanies of man will set him clear how fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fireof such a nature is his politic lovethis was my lords best hope now all are fledsave only the gods now his friends are deaddoors that were neer acquainted with their wardsmany a bounteous year must be employednow to guard sure their masterand this is all a liberal course allowswho cannot keep his wealth must keep his housewell met good morrow Titus and Hortensiusthe like to you kind VarroLuuswhat do we meet togetheray and I thinkone business does command us all for mineis moneyso is theirs and oursand sir Philotus toogood day at oncewelcome good brotherwhat do you think the hourlabouring for nineso muchis not my lord seen yetnot yetI wonder onit he was wont to shine at sevenay but the days are waxed shorter with himyou must consider that a prodigal courseis like the suns but not like his recoverableI fearitis deepest winter in lord Timons pursethat is one may reach deep enough and yetfind littleI am of your fear for thatiull show you how to observe a strange eventyour lord sends now for moneymost true he doesand he wears jewels now of Timons giftfor which I wait for moneyit is against my heartmark how strange it showstimon in this should pay more than he owesand een as if your lord should wear rich jewelsand send for money for emim weary of this charge the gods can witnessI know my lord hath spent of Timons wealthand now ingratitude makes it worse than stealthyes mines three thousand crowns whats yoursfive thousand mineitis much deep and it should seem by the sumyour masters confidence was above mineelse surely his had equalledone of lord Timons menflaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to come forthno indeed he is notwe attend his lordship pray signify so muchI need not tell him that he knows you are too diligentha is not that his steward muffled sohe goes away in a cloud call him call himdo you hear sirby your leave sirwhat do you ask of me my friendwe wait for certain money here sirayif money were as certain as your waitingitwere sure enoughwhy then preferred you not your sums and billswhen your false masters eat of my lords meatthen they could smile and fawn upon his debtsand take down the interest into their gluttonous mawsyou do yourselves but wrong to stir me uplet me pass quietlybelievet my lord and I have made an endI have no more to reckon he to spenday but this answer will not serveif itwill not serve itis not so base as youfor you serve knaveshow what does his cashiered worship mutterno matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in such may rail against great buildingsO heres Servilius now we shall know some answerif I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much from'tfor take'tof my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chambermany do keep their chambers are not sickand if it be so far beyond his healthmethinks he should the sooner pay his debtsand make a clear way to the godsgood godswe cannot take this for answer sirservilius help my lord my lordwhat are my doors opposed against my passagehave I been ever free and must my housebe my retentive enemy my gaolthe place which I have feasted does it nowlike all mankind show me an iron heartput in now Titusmy lord here is my billheres mineand mine my lordand ours my lordall our billsknock me down with em cleave me to the girdlealas my lordcut my heart in sumsmine fifty talentstell out my bloodfive thousand crowns my lordfive thousand drops pays that what yours and yoursmy lordmy lordtear me take me and the gods fall upon youfaith I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money these debts may well be called desperate ones for a madman owes emthey have een put my breath from me the slavescreditors devilsmy dear lordwhat if it should be somy lordiull have it so my stewardhere my lordso fitly go bid all my friends againLuus Lucullus and Sempronius alliull once more feast the rascalsO my lordyou only speak from your distracted soulthere is not so much left to furnish outa moderate tablebet not in thy care goI charge thee invite them all let in the tideof knaves once more my cook and iull providemy lord you have my voice to it the faultsbloody itis necessary he should dienothing emboldens sin so much as mercymost true the law shall bruise himhonour health and compassion to the senatenow captainI am a humble suitor to your virtuesfor pity is the virtue of the lawand none but tyrants use it cruellyit pleases time and fortune to lie heavyupon a friend of mine who in hot bloodhath stepped into the law which is past depthto those that without heed to plunge into the is a man setting his fate asideof comely virtuesnor did he soil the fact with cowardicean honour in him which buys out his faultbut with a noble fury and fair spiritseeing his reputation touched to deathhe did oppose his foeand with such sober and unnoted passionhe did behave his anger ere itwas spentas if he had but proved an argumentyou undergo too strict a paradoxstriving to make an ugly deed look fairyour words have took such pains as if they labouredto bring manslaughter into form and set quarrellingupon the head of valour which indeedis valour misbegot and came into the worldwhen sects and factions were newly bornhes truly valiant that can wisely sufferthe worst that man can breathe and make his wrongshis outsides to wear them like his raiment carelesslyand neer prefer his injuries to his heartto bring it into dangerif wrongs be evils and enforce us killwhat folly itis to hazard life for illmy lordyou cannot make gross sins look clearto revenge is no valour but to bearmy lords then under favour pardon meif I speak like a captainwhy do fond men expose themselves to battleand not endure all threats sleep uponitand let the foes quietly cut their throatswithout repugnancy if there besuch valour in the bearing what make weabroad why then women are more valiantthat stay at home if bearing carry itand the ass more captain than the lion the felonloaden with irons wiser than the judgeif wisdom be in suffering O my lordsas you are great be pitifully goodwho cannot condemn rashness in cold bloodto kill I grant is sins extremest gustbut in defence by mercy itis most justto be in anger is impietybut who is man that is not angryweigh but the crime with thisyou breathe in vainin vain his service doneat Laced money and Byzantiumwere a suffient briber for his lifewhats thatI say my lords he has done fair serviceand slain in fight many of your enemieshow full of valour did he bear himselfin the last conflict and made plenteous woundshe has made too much plenty with emhes a sworn rioter he has a sin that oftendrowns him and takes his valour prisonerif there were no foes that were enoughto overcome him in that beastly furyhe has been known to commit outragesand cherish factions itis inferred to ushis days are foul and his drink dangeroushe dieshard fate he might have died in warmy lords if not for any parts in himthough his right arm might purchase his own timeand be in debt to none yet more to move youtake my deserts to his and join em bothand for I know your reverend ages lovesecurity iull pawn my victories allmy honour to you upon his good returnsif by this crime he owes the law his lifewhy let the war receivet in valiant gorefor law is strict and war is nothing morewe are for law he dies urge it no moreon height of our displeasure friend or brotherhe forfeits his own blood that spills anothermust it be so it must not be my lordsI do beseech you know me howcall me to your remembrances whatI cannot think but your age has forgot meit could not else be I should prove so baseto sue and be denied such common gracemy wounds ache at youdo you dare our angeritis in few words but spaous in effectwe banish thee for everbanish mebanish your dotage banish usurythat makes the senate uglyif after two days shine Athens contain theeattend our weightier judgment and not to swell our spirithe shall be executed presentlynow the gods keep you old enough that you may liveonly in bone that none may look on youI am worse than mad I have kept back their foeswhile they have told their money and let outtheir coin upon large interest I myselfrich only in large hurts all those for thisis this the balsam that the usuring senatepours into captains wounds banishmentit comes not ill I hate not to be banishedit is a cause worthy my spleen and furythat I may strike at Athens iull cheer upmy discontented troops and lay for heartsitis honour with most lands to be at oddssoldiers should brook as little wrongs as godsthe good time of day to you sirI also wish it you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other dayupon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friendsit should not be by the persuasion of his new feastingI should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjured me beyond them and I must needs appearin like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was outI am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things goevery man heres so what would he have borrowed youa thousand piecesa thousand pieceswhat of youhe sent to me sir here he comeswith all my heart gentlemen both and how fare youever at the best hearing well of your lordshipthe swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordshipnor more willingly leaves winter such summer-birds are men gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly ofthe trumpets sound we shall to't presentlyI hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messengerO sir let it not trouble youmy noble lordah my good friend what cheermy most honourable lord I am een sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggarthink not onit sirif you had sent but two hours beforelet it not cumber your better remembrancecome bring in all togetherall covered dishesroyal cheer I warrant youdoubt not that if money and the season can yield ithow do you whats the newsalbiades is banished hear you of italbiades banishedalbiades banisheditis so be sure of ithow howI pray you upon whatmy worthy friends will you draw neariull tell you more anon heres a noble feast towardthis is the old man stillwillit hold willit holdit does but time will and soI do conceiveeach man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike make not a ty feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place sit sit the gods require our thanksyou great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness for your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains if there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are the rest of your fees O gods the senators of Athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction for these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcomeuncover dogs and lapwhat does his lordship meanI know notmay you a better feast never beholdyou knot of mouth-friends smoke and lukewarm wateris your perfection this is Timons lastwho stuck and spangled with your flatterieswashes it off and sprinkles in your

to if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be

dieI am quitmore things like men eat Timon and abhor themwhere should he have this gold it is some poor fragment some slender ort of his remainder the mere want of gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this melancholyit is noised he hath a mass of treasurelet us make the assay upon him if he care not forit he will supply useasily if he covetously reserve it how shalls get ittrue for he bears it not about him itis hidis not this hewhereitis his descriptionhe I know himsave thee Timonnow thievessoldiers not thievesboth too and womens sonswe are not thieves but men that much do wantyour greatest want is you want much of meatwhy should you want behold the earth hath rootswithin this mile break forth a hundred springsthe oaks bear mast the briers scarlet hipsthe bounteous housewife nature on each bushlays her full mess before you Want why wantwe cannot live on grass on berries wateras beasts and birds and fishesnor on the beasts themselves the

ititis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mysteryiull believe him as an enemy and give over my tradelet us first see peace in Athens there is no time so miserable but a man may be trueO you godsis yond despised and ruinous man my lordfull of decay and failing O monumentand wonder of good deeds evilly bestowedwhat an alteration of honourhas desperate want madewhat viler thing upon the earth than friendswho can bring noblest minds to basest endshow rarely does it meet with this times guisewhen man was wished to love his enemiesgrant I may ever love and rather woothose that would mischief me than those that dohe hath caught me in his eye I will presentmy honest grief unto him and as my lordstill serve him with my life my dearest masteraway what art thouhave you forgot me sirwhy dost ask that I have forgot all menthen if thou grantest thourt a man I have forgot theean honest poor servant of yoursthen I know thee notI never had an honest man about me ay allI kept were knaves to serve in meat to villainsthe gods are witnessneer did poor steward wear a truer grieffor his undone lord than mine eyes for youwhat dost thou weep come nearer then I love theebecause thou art a woman and disclaimestflinty mankind whose eyes do never givebut thorough lust and laughter pitys sleepingstrange times that weep with laughing not with weepingI beg of you to know me good my lordto accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth laststo entertain me as your steward stillhad I a stewardso true so just and now so comfortableit almost turns my dangerous nature mildlet me behold thy face Surely this manwas born of womanforgive my general and exceptless rashnessyou perpetual sober gods I do proclaimone honest man mistake me not but oneno more I pray and hes a stewardhow fain would I have hated all mankindand thou redeemest thyself but all save theeI fell with cursesmethinks thou art more honest now than wisefor by oppressing and betraying methou mightst have sooner got another servicefor many so arrive at second mastersupon their first lords neck but tell me truefor I must ever doubt though neer so sureis not thy kindness subtle covetousif not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal giftsexpecting in return twenty for oneno my most worthy master in whose breastdoubt and suspect alas are placed too lateyou should have feared false times when you did feastsuspect still comes when an estate is leastthat which I show heaven knows is merely loveduty and zeal to your unmatched mindcare of your food and living and believe itmy most honoured lordfor any benefit that points to meeither in hope or present id exchangefor this one wish that you had power and wealthto requite me by making rich yourselflook thee itis so thou singly honest manhere take the gods out of my miseryhave sent thee treasure go live rich and happybut thus conditioned thou shalt build from menhate all curse all show charity to nonebut let the famished flesh slide from the boneere thou relieve the beggar give to dogswhat thou denyest to men let prisons swallow emdebts wither em to nothing be men like blasted woodsand may diseases lick up their false bloodsand so farewell and thriveO let me stayand comfort you my masterif thou hatestcurses stay not fly whilst thourt blessed and freeneer see thou man and let me neer see theeas I took note of the place it cannot be far where he abideswhats to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of goldcertain Albiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity itis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sumthen this breaking of his has been but a try for his friendsnothing else you shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest therefore itis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travel for if it be a just and true report that goes of his havingwhat have you now to present unto himnothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent pieceI must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming towards himgood as the best promising is the very air ofthe time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes itexcellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyselfI am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulencymust thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so I have gold for theenay lets seek himthen do we sin against our own estatewhen we may profit meet and come too latetruewhen the day serves before black-cornered nightfind what thou wantest by free and offered lightcomeiull meet you at the turn what a gods goldthat he is worshipped in a baser templethan where swine feeditis thou that riggest the bark and ploughest the foamsettlest admired reverence in a slaveto thee be worship and thy saints for ayebe crowned with plagues that thee alone obeyfit I meet themhail worthy Timonour late noble masterhave I once lived to see two honest mensirhaving often of your open bounty tastedhearing you were retired your friends falln offwhose thankless natures O abhorred spiritsnot all the whips of heaven are large enoughwhat to youwhose star-like nobleness gave life and influenceto their whole being I am rapt and cannot coverthe monstrous bulk of this ingratitudewith any size of wordslet it go naked men may seeit the betteryou that are honest by being what you aremake them best seen and knownhe and myselfhave travelled in the great shower of your giftsand sweetly felt itay you are honest menwe are hither come to offer you our servicemost honest men why how shall I requite

lord but thereforecame not my friend nor Igood honest men thou drawest a counterfeitbest in all Athens thourt indeed the bestthou counterfeitest most livelyso so my lordeen so sir as I say and for thy fictionwhy thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooththat thou art even natural in thine artbut for all this my honest-natured friendsI must needs say you have a little faultmarry itis not monstrous in you neither wish Iyou take much pains to mendbeseech your honourto make it known to usyoull take it illmost thankfully my lordwill you indeeddoubt it not worthy lordtheres never a one of you but trusts a knavethat mightily deceives youdo we my lorday and you hear him cog see him dissembleknow his gross patchery love him feed himkeep in your bosom yet

ye slavesyou have done work for me theres payment henceyou are an alchemist make gold of thatout rascal dogsit is in vain that you would speak with Timonfor he is set so only to himselfthat nothing but himself which looks like manis friendly with himbring us to his caveit is our part and promise to the Atheniansto speak with Timonat all times alikemen are not still the same itwas time and griefsthat framed him thus time with his fairer handoffering the fortunes of his former daysthe former man may make him bring us to himand chance it as it mayhere is his cavepeace and content be here lord Timon Timonlook out and speak to friends the Atheniansby two of their most reverend senate greet theespeak to them noble Timonthousun that comfortest burn speak and be

greet thee TimonI thank them and would send them back the plaguecould I but catch it for themO forgetwhat we are sorry for ourselves in theethe senators with one consent of loveentreat thee back to Athens who have thoughton speal dignities which vacant liefor thy best use and wearingthey confesstoward thee forgetfulness to general grosswhich now the public body which doth seldomplay the recanter feeling in itselfa lack of Timons aid hath sense withalof its own fail restraining aid to Timonand send forth us to make their sorrowed rendertogether with a recompense more fruitfulthan their offence can weigh down by the dramay even such heaps and sums of love and wealthas shall to thee block out what wrongs were theirsand write in thee the figures of their loveever to read them thineyou witch me in itsurprise me to the very brink of tearslend me a fools heart and a womans eyesand iull beweep these comforts worthy senatorstherefore so please thee to return with usand of our Athens thine and ours to takethe captainship thou shalt be met with thanksallowed with absolute power and thy good namelive with authority so soon we shall drive backof Albiades the approaches wildwho like a boar too savage doth root uphis countrys peaceand shakes his threatning swordagainst the walls of Athenstherefore Timonwell sir I will therefore I will sir thusif Albiades kill my countrymenlet Albiades know this of Timonthat Timon cares not but if he sack fair Athensand take our goodly aged men by the beardsgiving our holy virgins to the stainof contumelious beastly mad-brained warthen let him know and tell him Timon speaks itin pity of our aged and our youthI cannot choose but tell him that I care notand let him taket at worst for their knives care notwhile you have throats to answer for myselftheres not a whittle in the unruly campbut I do prize it at my love beforethe reverendest throat in Athens so I leave youto the protection of the prosperous godsas thieves to keepersstay not alls in vainwhy I was writing of my epitaphit will be seen to-morrow my long sicknessof health and living now begins to mendand nothing brings me all things go live stillbe Albiades your plague you hisand last so long enoughwe speak in vainbut yet I love my country and am notone that rejoices in the common wrackas common bruit doth put itthats well spokecommend me to my loving countrymenthese words become your lips as they pass through themand enter in our ears like great triumphersin their applauding gatescommend me to themand tell them that to ease them of their griefstheir fears of hostile strokes their aches lossestheir pangs of love with other indent throesthat natures fragile vessel doth sustainin lifes uncertain voyage I will some kindness do themiull teach them to prevent wild Albiades wrathI like this well he will return againI have a tree which grows here in my closethat mine own use invites me to cut downand shortly must I fell it tell my friendstell Athens in the sequence of degreefrom high to low throughout that whoso pleaseto stop affliction let him take his hastecome hither ere my tree hath felt the axeand hang himself I pray you do my greetingtrouble him no further thus you still shall find himcome not to me again but say to Athanstimon hath made his everlasting mansionupon the beached verge of the salt floodwho once a day with his embossed froththe turbulent surge shall cover thither comeand let my grave-stone be your oraclelips let sour words go by and language endwhat is amiss plague and infection mendgraves only be mens works and death their gainsun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reignhis discontents are unremovably coupled to natureour hope in him is dead let us returnand strain what other means is left unto usin our dear perilit requires swift footthou hast painfully discovered are his filesas full as thy reportI have spoke the leastbesides his expedition promisespresent approachwe stand much hazard if they bring not TimonI met a courier one mine anent friendwhom though in general part we were opposedyet our old love made a particular forceand made us speak like friends this man was ridingfrom Albiades to Timons cavewith letters of entreaty which importedhis fellowship inthe cause against your tyin part for his sake movedhere

intendRomans of five-and-twenty valiant sonshalf of the number that king Priam hadbehold the poor remains alive and deadthese that survive let Rome reward with lovethese that I bring unto their latest homewith burial among their ancestorshere Goths have given me leave to sheathe my swordTitus unkind and careless of thine ownwhy sufferest thou thy sons unburied yetto hover on the dreadful shore of Styxmake way to lay them by their brethrenthere greet in silence as the dead are wontand sleep in peace slain in your countrys warsO sacred receptacle of my joyssweet cell of virtue and nobilityhow many sons of mine hast thou in storethat thou wilt never render to me moregive us the proudest prisoner of the Gothsthat we may hew his limbs and on a pilead manes fratrum

dear to mesufficeth not that we are brought to Rometo beautify thy triumphs and returncaptive to thee and to thy Roman yokebut must my sons be slaughtered in the streetsfor valiant doings in their countrys causeO if to fight for king and commonwealwere piety in thine it is in theseandronicus stain not thy tomb with bloodwilt thou draw near the nature of the godsdraw near them then in

mocks me oncethee never nor thy traitorous haughty sonsconfederates all thus to dishonour mewas none in Rome to make a stalebut Saturnine full well Andronicusagreed these deeds with that proud brag of thinethat saidst I begged the empire at thy handsO monstrous what reproachful words are thesebut go thy ways go give that changing pieceto him that flourished for her with his sworda valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoyone fit to bandy with thy lawless sonsto ruffle in the commonwealth of Romethese words are razors to my wounded heartand therefore lovely Tamora queen of Gothsthat like the stately Phyrnia be mongst her nymphsdost overshine the gallantest dames of Romeif thou be pleased with this my sudden choicebehold I choose thee Tamora for my brideand will

bridesent by the heavens for prince Saturninewhose wisdom hath her fortune conqueredthere shall we consummate our spousal rightsI am not bid to wait upon this brideTitus when wert thou wont to walk alonedishonoured thus and challenged of wrongsO Titus see O see what thou hast donein a bad quarrel slain a virtuous sonno foolish tribune no no son of minenor thou nor these confederates in the deedthat hath dishonoured all our familyunworthy brother and unworthy sonsbut let us give him burial as becomesgive Mutius burial with our brethrentraitors away he rests not in this tombthis monument five hundred years hath stoodwhich I have sumptuously re-edifiedhere none but soldiers and Romes servitorsrepose in fame none basely slain in brawlsbury him where you can he comes not heremy lord this is impiety in youmy nephew Mutius deeds do plead for himhe must be buried with his brethrenand shall or him we will accompanyand shall what villain was it spake that wordhe that would vouch it in any place but herewhat would you bury him in my despiteno noble Titus but entreat of theeto pardon Mutius and to bury himMarcus even thou hast struck upon my crestand with these boys mine honour thou hast woundedmy foes I do repute you every oneso trouble me no more but get you gonehe is not with himself let us withdrawnot I till Mutius bones be buriedbrother for in that name doth nature pleadfather and in that name doth nature speakspeak thou no more if all the rest will speedrenowned Titus more than half my souldear father soul and substance of us allsuffer thy brother Marcus to interhis noble nephew here in virtues nestthat died in honour and Lavinias causethou art a Roman be not barbarousthe Greeks upon advice did bury Ajaxthat slew himself and wise Laertes sondid graciously plead for his funeralslet not young Mutius then that was thy joybe barred his entrance hererise Marcus risethe dismallest day is this that eer I sawto be dishonoured by my sons in Romewell bury him and bury me the nextthere lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friendstill we with trophies do adorn thy tombno man shed tears for noble Mutiushe lives in fame that died in virtues causemy lord to step out of these dreary dumpshow comes it that the subtle queen of Gothsis of a sudden thus advanced in RomeI know not Marcus but I know it iswhether by device or no the heavens can tellis she not then beholding to the manthat brought her for this high good turn so faryes and will nobly him remunerateso Bassianus you have played your prizegod give you joy sir of your gallant brideand you of yours my lord I say no morenor wish no less and so I take my leavetraitor if Rome have law or we have powerthou and thy faction shall repent this raperape call you it my lord to seize my ownmy true-betrothed love and now my wifebut let the laws of Rome determine allmeanwhile I am possessed of that is mineitis good sir you are very short with usbut if we live well be as sharp with youmy lord what I have done as best I mayanswer I must and shall do with my lifeonly thus much I give your grace to knowby all the duties that I owe to Romethis noble gentleman lord Titus hereis in opinion and in honour wrongedthat in the rescue of Laviniawith his own hand did slay his youngest sonin zeal to you and highly moved to wrathto be controlled in that he frankly gavereceive him then to favour Saturninethat hath expressed himself in all his deedsa father and a friend to thee and Romeprince Bassianus leave to plead my deedsitis thou and those that have dishonoured meRome and the righteous heavens be my judgehow I have loved and honoured Saturninemy worthy lord if ever Tamorawere gracious in those princely eyes of thinethen hear me speak indifferently for alland at my suit sweet pardon what is pastwhat madam be dishonoured openlyand basely put it up without revengenot so my lord the gods of Rome forfendI should be author to dishonour youbut on mine honour dare I undertakefor good lord Titus innocence in allwhose fury not dissembled speaks his griefsthen at my suit look graciously on himlose not so noble a friend on vain supposenor with sour looks afflict his gentle heartmy lord be ruled by me be won at lastdissemble all your griefs and discontentsyou are but newly planted in your thronelest then the people and patrians tooupon a just survey take Titus partand so supplant you for ingratitudewhich Rome reputes to be a heinous sinyield at entreats and then let me aloneiull find a day to massacre them alland raze their faction and their familythe cruel father and his traitorous sonsto whom I sued for my dear sons lifeand make them know what itis to let a queenkneel in the streets and beg for grace in vaincome come sweet emperor come Andronicustake up this good old man and cheer the heartthat dies in tempest of thy angry frownrise Titus rise my empress hath prevailedI thank your majesty and her my lordthese words these looks infuse new life in meTitus I am incorporate in Romea Roman now adopted happilyand must advise the emperor for his goodthis day all quarrels die Andronicusand let it be mine honour good my lordthat I have reconled your friends and youfor you prince Bassianus I have passedmy word and promise to the emperorthat you will be more mild and tractableand fear not lords and you Laviniaby my advice all humbled on your kneesyou shall ask pardon of his majestywe do and vow to heaven and to his highnessthat what we did was mildly as we mighttendering our sisters honour and our ownthat on mine honour here I do protestaway and talk not trouble us no morenay nay sweet emperor we must all be friendsthe tribune and his nephews kneel for graceI will not be denied sweet heart look backMarcus for thy sake and thy brothers hereand at my lovely Tamoras entreatsI do remit these young mens heinous faultsstand upLavinia though you left me like a churlI found a friend and sure as death I sworeI would not part a bachelor from the priestcome if the emperors court can feast two bridesyou are my guest Lavinia and your friendsthis day shall be a love-day Tamorato-morrow an it please your majestyto hunt the panther and the hart with mewith horn and hound well give your grace bon jourbe it so Titus and gramercy toonow climbeth Tamora Olympus topsafe out of fortunes shot and sits aloftsecure of thunders crack or lightning flashadvanced above pale envys threatning reachas when the golden sun salutes the mornand having gilt the ocean with his beamsgallops the zodiac in his glistering coachand overlooks the highest-peering hillsso Tamoraupon her wit doth earthly honour waitand virtue stoops and trembles at her frownthen Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughtsto mount aloft with thy imperial mistressand mount her pitch whom thou in triumph longhast prisoner held fettered in amorous chainsand faster bound to Aarons charming eyesthan is Prometheus tied to Caucasusaway with slavish weeds and servile thoughtsI will be bright and shine in pearl and goldto wait upon this new-made empressto wait said I to wanton with this queenthis goddess this Semiramis this nymphthis siren that will charm Romes Saturnineand see his shipwrack and his commonwealsholla what storm is thischiron thy years want wit thy wit wants edgeand manners to intrude where I am gracedand may for aught thou knowest affected beDemetrius thou dost over-ween in alland so in this to bear me down with bravesitis not the difference of a year or twomakes me less gracious or thee more fortunateI am as able and as fit as thouto serve and to deserve my mistress graceand that my sword upon thee shall approveand plead my passions for Lavinias loveclubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peacewhy boy although our mother unadvisedgave you a danng-rapier by your sideare you so desperate grown to threat your friendsgo to have your lath glued within your sheathtill you know better how to handle itmeanwhile sir with the little skill I havefull well shalt thou perceive how much I dareay boy grow ye so bravewhy how now lordsso near the emperors palace dare you drawand maintain such a quarrel openlyfull well I wot the ground of all this grudgeI would not for a million of goldthe cause were known to them it most concernsnor would your noble mother for much morebe so dishonoured in the court of Romefor shame put upnot I till I have sheathedmy rapier in his bosom and withalthrust those reproachful speeches down his throatthat he hath breathed in my dishonour herefor that I am prepared and full resolvedfoul-spoken coward that thunderest with thy tongueand with thy weapon nothing darest performaway I saynow by the gods that war-like Goths adorethis petty brabble will undo us allwhy lords and think you not how dangerousit is to jet upon a princes rightwhat is Lavinia then become so looseor Bassianus so degeneratethat for her love such quarrels may be broachedwithout controlment justice or revengeyoung lords beware an should the empress knowthis discords ground the music would not pleaseI care not I knew she and all the worldI love Lavinia more than all the worldyoungling learn thou to make some meaner choiceLavinia is thine elder brothers hopewhy are ye mad or know ye not in Romehow furious and impatient they beand cannot brook competitors in loveI tell you lords you do but plot your deathsby this deviceaaron a thousand deathswould I propose to achieve her whom I loveto achieve her howwhy makest thou it so strangeshe is a woman therefore may be wooedshe is a woman therefore may be wonshe is Lavinia therefore must be lovedwhat man more water glideth by the millthan wots the miller of and easy it isof a cut loaf to steal a shive we knowthough Bassianus be the emperors brotherbetter than he have worn Vulcans badgeay and as good as Saturninus maythen why should he despair that knows to court itwith words fair looks and liberalitywhat hast thou not full often struck a doeand borne her cleanly by the keepers nosewhy then it seems some certain snatch or sowould serve your turnsay so the turn were servedaaron thou hast hit itwould you had hit it toothen should not we be tired with this adowhy hark ye hark ye and are you such foolsto square for this would it offend you thenthat both should speedfaith not menor me so I were onefor shame be friends and join for that you jaritis policy and stratagem must dothat you affect and so must you resolvethat what you cannot as you would achieveyou must perforce accomplish as you maytake this of me Lucrece was not more chastethan this Lavinia Bassianus lovea speedier course than lingering languishmentmust we pursue and I have found the pathmy lords a solemn hunting is in handthere will the lovely Roman ladies troopthe forest walks are wide and spaousand many unfrequented plots there arefitted by kind for rape and villanysingle you thither then this dainty doeand strike her home by force if not by wordsthis way or not at all stand you in hopecome come our empress with her sacred witto villany and vengeance consecratewill we acquaint with all that we intendand she shall file our engines with advicethat will not suffer you to square yourselvesbut to your wishes height advance you boththe emperors court is like the house of famethe palace full of tongues of eyes and earsthe woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dullthere speak and strike brave boys and take your turnsthere serve your lusts shadowed from heavens eyeand revel in Lavinias treasurythy counsel lad smells of no cowardicesit fas aut nefas till I find the streamto cool this heat a charm to calm these fitsper Styga per manes vehorthe hunt is up the morn is bright and greythe fields are fragrant and the woods are greenuncouple here and let us make a bayand wake the emperor and his lovely brideand rouse the prince and ring a hunters pealthat all the court may echo with the noisesons let it be your charge as it is oursto attend the emperors person carefullyI have been troubled in my sleep this nightbut dawning day new comfort hath inspiredmany good morrows to your majestymadam to you as many and as goodI promised your grace a hunters pealand you have rung it lustily my lordsomewhat too early for new-married ladiesLavinia how say youI say noI have been broad awake two hours and morecome on then horse and chariots let us haveand to our sportmadam now shall ye seeour Roman huntingI have dogs my lordwill rouse the proudest panther in the chaseand climb the highest promontory topand I have horse will follow where the gamemakes way and run like swallows oer the plainchiron we hunt not we with horse nor houndbut hope to pluck a dainty doe to groundhe that had wit would think that I had noneto bury so much gold under a treeand never after to inherit itlet him that thinks of me so abjectlyknow that this gold must coin a stratagemwhich cunningly effected will begeta very excellent piece of villanyand so repose sweet gold for their unrestthat have their alms out of the empress chestmy lovely Aaron wherefore lookest thou sadwhen every thing doth make a gleeful boastthe birds chant melody on every bushthe snake lies rolled in the cheerful sunthe green leaves quiver with the cooling windand make a chequered shadow on the groundunder their sweet shade Aaron let us sitand whilst the babbling echo mocks the houndsreplying shrilly to the well-tuned hornsas if a double hunt were heard at oncelet us sit down and mark their yelping noiseand after conflict such as was supposedthe wandering prince and Dido once enjoyedwhen with a happy storm they were surprisedand curtained with a counsel-keeping cavewe may each wreathed in the others armsour pastimes done possess a golden slumberwhiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birdsbe unto us as is a nurses songof lullaby to bring her babe asleepmadam though Venus govern your desiressaturn is dominator over minewhat signifies my deadly-standing eyemy silence and my cloudy melancholymy fleece of woolly hair that now uncurlseven as an adder when she doth unrollto do some fatal executionno madam these are no venereal signsvengeance is in my heart death in my handblood and revenge are hammering in my headhark Tamora the empress of my soulwhich never hopes more heaven than rests in theethis is the day of doom for Bassianushis Philomel must lose her tongue to-daythy sons make pillage of her chastityand wash their hands in Bassianus bloodseest thou this letter take it up I pray theeand give the king this fatal-plotted scrollnow question me no more we are espiedhere comes a parcel of our hopeful bootywhich dreads not yet their lives destructionah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than lifeno more great empress Bassianus comesbe cross with him and iull go fetch thy sonsto back thy quarrels whatsoeer they bewho have we here Romes royal empressunfurnished of her well-beseeming troopor is it Dian habited like herwho hath abandoned her holy grovesto see the general hunting in this forestsaucy controller of our private stepshad I the power that some say Dian hadthy temples should be planted presentlywith horns as was Act ons and the houndsshould drive upon thy new-transformed limbsunmannerly intruder as thou artunder your patience gentle empressitis thought you have a goodly gift in horningand to be doubted that your Moor and youare singled forth to try experimentsjove shield your husband from his hounds to-dayitis pity they should take him for a stagbelieve me queen your swarth mmeriandoth make your honour of his bodys huespotted detested and abominablewhy are you sequestered from all your traindismounted from your snow-white goodly steedand wandered hither to an obscure plotaccompanied but with a barbarous Moorif foul desire had not conducted youand being intercepted in your sportgreat reason that my noble lord be ratedfor sauness I pray you let us henceand let her joy her raven-coloured lovethis valley fits the purpose passing wellthe king my brother shall have note of thisay for these slips have made him noted longgood king to be so mightily abusedwhy have I patience to endure all thishow now dear sovereign and our gracious motherwhy doth your highness look so pale and wanhave I not reason think you to look palethese two have ticed me hither to this placea barren detested vale you see it isthe trees though summer yet forlorn and leanoercome with moss and baleful mistletoehere never shines the sun here nothing breedsunless the nightly owl or fatal ravenand when they showed me this abhorred pitthey told me here at dead time of the nighta thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakesten thousand swelling toads as many urchinswould make such fearful and confused criesas any mortal body hearing itshould straight fall mad or else die suddenlyno sooner had they told this hellish talebut straight they told me they would bind me hereunto the body of a dismal yewand leave me to this miserable deathand then they called me foul adulteresslasvious Goth and all the bitterest termsthat ever ear did hear to such effectand had you not by wondrous fortune comethis vengeance on me had they executedrevenge it as you love your mothers lifeor be ye not henceforth called my childrenthis is a witness that I am thy sonand this for me struck home to show my strengthay come Semiramis nay barbarous Tamorafor no name fits thy nature but thy owngive me thy poniard you shall know my boysyour mothers hand shall right your mothers wrongstay madam here is more belongs to herfirst thrash the corn than after burn the strawthis minion stood upon her chastityupon her nuptial vow her loyaltyand with that painted hope she braves your mightinessand shall she carry this unto her gravean if she do I would I were an eunuchdrag hence her husband to some secret holeand make his dead trunk pillow to our lustbut when ye have the honey ye desirelet not this wasp outlive us both to stingI warrant you madam we will make that surecome mistress now perforce we will enjoythat nice-preserved honesty of yoursO Tamora thou bearest a womans faceI will not hear her speak away with hersweet lords entreat her hear me but a wordlisten fair madam let it be your gloryto see her tears but be your heart to themas unrelenting flint to drops of rainwhen did the tigers young ones teach the damO do not learn her wrath she taught it theethe milk thou suckedst from her did turn to marbleeven at thy teat thou hadst thy tyrannyyet every mother breeds not sons alikedo thou entreat her show a woman pitywhat wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastarditis true the raven doth not hatch a larkyet have I heard O could I find it nowthe lion moved with pity did endureto have his princely paws pared all awaysome say that ravens foster forlorn childrenthe whilst their own birds famish in their nestsO be to me though thy hard heart say nonothing so kind but something pitifulI know not what it means away with herO let me teach thee for my fathers sakethat gave thee life when well he might have slain theebe not obdurate open thy deaf earshadst thou in person neer offended meeven for his sake am I pitilessremember boys I poured forth tears in vainto save your brother from the sacrificebut fierce Andronicus would not relenttherefore away with her and use her as you willthe worse to her the better loved of meO Tamora be called a gentle queenand with thine own hands kill me in this placefor itis not life that I have begged so longpoor I was slain when Bassianus diedwhat beggest thou then fond woman let me goitis present death I beg and one thing morethat womanhood denies my tongue to tellO keep me from their worse than killing lustand tumble me into some loathsome pitwhere never mans eye may behold my bodydo this and be a charitable murdererso should I rob my sweet sons of their feeno let them satisfy their lust on theeaway for thou hast stayed us here too longno grace no womanhood ah beastly creaturethe blot and enemy to our general nameconfusion fallnay then iull stop your mouth bring thou her husbandthis is the hole where Aaron bid us hide himfarewell my sons see that you make her sureneer let my heart know merry cheer indeedtill all the AndronI be made awaynow will I hence to seek my lovely Moorand let my spleenful sons this trull deflowercome on my lords the better foot beforestraight will I bring you to the loathsome pitwhere I espied the panther fast asleepmy sight is very dull whateer it bodesand mine I promise you wereit not for shamewell could I leave our sport to sleep awhilewhat art thou falln what subtle hole is thiswhose mouth is covered with rude-growing briersupon whose leaves are drops of new-shed bloodas fresh as mornings dew distilled on flowersa very fatal place it seems to mespeak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fallO brother with the dismallest object hurtthat ever eye with sight made heart lamentnow will I fetch the king to find them herethat he thereby may give a likely guesshow these were they that made away his brotherwhy dost not comfort me and help me outfrom this unhallowed and blood-stained holeI am surprised with an uncouth feara chilling sweat oerruns my trembling jointsmy heart suspects more than mine eye can seeto prove thou hast a true-divining heartaaron and thou look down into this denand see a fearful sight of blood and deathaaron is gone and my compassionate heartwill not permit mine eyes once to beholdthe thing whereat it trembles by surmiseO tell me how it is for neer till nowwas I a child to fear I know not whatlord Bassianus lies embrewed hereall on a heap like to a slaughtered lambin this detested dark blood-drinking pitif it be dark how dost thou know itis heupon his bloody finger he doth weara precious ring that lightens all the holewhich like a taper in some monumentdoth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeksand shows the ragged entrails of the pitso pale did shine the moon on Pyramuswhen he by night lay bathed in maiden bloodO brother help me with thy fainting handif fear hath made thee faint as me it hathout of this fell devouring receptacleas hateful as Cocytus misty mouthreach me thy hand that I may help thee outor wanting strength to do thee so much goodI may be plucked into the swallowing wombof this deep pit poor Bassianus graveI have no strength to pluck thee to the brinknor I no strength to climb without thy helpthy hand once more I will not loose againtill thou art here aloft or I belowthou canst not come to me I come to theealong with me iull see what hole is hereand what he is that now is leaped into itsay who art thou that lately didst descendinto this gaping hollow of the earththe unhappy son of old Andronicusbrought hither in a most unlucky hourto find thy brother Bassianus deadmy brother dead I know thou dost but jesthe and his lady both are at the lodgeupon the north side of this pleasant chaseitis not an hour since I left him therewe know not where you left him all alivebut out alas here have we found him deadwhere is my lord the kinghere Tamora though grieved with killing griefwhere is thy brother Bassianusnow to the bottom dost thou search my woundpoor Bassianus here lies murderedthen all too late I bring this fatal writthe complot of this timeless tragedyand wonder greatly that mans face can foldin pleasing smiles such murderous tyrannyand if we miss to meet him handsomelysweet huntsman Bassianus itis we meando thou so much as dig the grave for himthou knowest our meaning look for thy rewardamong the nettles at the elder-treewhich overshades the mouth of that same pitwhere we decreed to bury Bassianusdo this and purchase us thy lasting friendsO Tamora was ever heard the likethis is the pit and this the elder-treelook sirs if you can find the huntsman outthat should have murdered Bassianus heremy gracious lord here is the bag of goldtwo of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kindhave here bereft my brother of his lifesirs drag them from the pit unto the prisonthere let them bide until we have devisedsome never-heard-of torturing pain for themwhat are they in this pit O wondrous thinghow easily murder is discoveredhigh emperor upon my feeble kneeI beg this boon with tears not lightly shedthat this fell fault of my accursed sonsaccursed if the fault be proved in themif it be proved you see it is apparentwho found this letter Tamora was it youandronicus himself did take it upI did my lord yet let me be their bailfor by my fathers reverend tomb I vowthey shall be ready at your highness willto answer their suspion with their livesthou shalt not bail them see thou follow mesome bring the murdered body some the murdererslet them not speak a word the guilt is plainfor by my soul were there worse end than deaththat end upon them should be executedandronicus I will entreat the kingfear not thy sons they shall do well enoughcome Luus come stay not to talk with themso now go tell an if thy tongue can speakwho itwas that cut thy tongue and ravished theewrite down thy mind bewray thy meaning soan if thy stumps will let thee play the scribesee how with signs and tokens she can scrowlgo home call for sweet water wash thy handsshe hath no tongue to call nor hands to washand so lets leave her to her silent walksan itwere my case I should go hang myselfif thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cordwhos this my niece that flies away so fastcousin a word where is your husbandif I do dream would all my wealth would wake meif I do wake some planet strike me downthat I may slumber in eternal sleepspeak gentle niece what stern ungentle handshave lopped and hewed and made thy body bareof her two branches those sweet ornamentswhose rcling shadows kings have sought to sleep inand might not gain so great a happinessas have thy love why dost not speak to mealas a crimson river of warm bloodlike to a bubbling fountain stirred with winddoth rise and fall between thy rosed lipscoming and going with thy honey breathbut sure some Tereus hath deflowered theeand lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongueah now thou turnest away thy face for shameand notwithstanding all this loss of bloodas from a conduit with three issuing spoutsyet do thy cheeks look red as Titans faceblushing to be encountered with a cloudshall I speak for thee shall I say itis soO that I knew thy heart and knew the beastthat I might rail at him to ease my mindsorrow concealed like to an oven stoppeddoth burn the heart to nders where it isfair Philomela she but lost her tongueand in a tedious sampler sewed her mindbut lovely niece that mean is cut from theea craftier Tereus hast thou met withaland he hath cut those pretty fingers offthat could have better sewed than PhilomelO had the monster seen those lily handstremble like aspen-leaves upon a luteand make the silken strings delight to kiss themhe would not then have touched them for his lifeor had he heard the heavenly harmonywhich that sweet tongue hath madehe would have dropped his knife and fell asleepas Cerberus at the Thraan poets feetcome let us go and make thy father blindfor such a sight will blind a fathers eyeone hours storm will drown the fragrant meadswhat will whole months of tears thy fathers eyesdo not draw back for we will mourn with theeO could our mourning ease thy miseryhear me grave fathers noble tribunes stayfor pity of mine age whose youth was spentin dangerous wars whilst you securely sleptfor all my blood in Romes great quarrel shedfor all the frosty nights that I have watchedand for these bitter tears which now you seefilling the aged wrinkles in my cheeksbe pitiful to my condemned sonswhose souls are not corrupted as itis thoughtfor two and twenty sons I never weptbecause they died in honours lofty bedfor these these tribunes in the dust I writemy hearts deep languor and my souls sad tearslet my tears stanch the earths dry appetitemy sons sweet blood will make it shame and blushO earth I will befriend thee more with rainthat shall distil from these two anent urnsthan youthful April shall with all his showersin summers drought iull drop upon thee stillin winter with warm tears iull melt the snowand keep eternal spring-time on thy faceso thou refuse to drink my dear sons bloodO reverend tribunes O gentle aged menunbind my sons reverse the doom of deathand let me say that never wept beforemy tears are now prevailing oratorsO noble father you lament in vainthe tribunes hear you not no man is byand you recount your sorrows to a stoneah Luus for thy brothers let me pleadgrave tribunes once more I entreat of youmy gracious lord no tribune hears you speakwhy itis no matter man if they did hearthey would not mark me or if they did markthey would not pity me yet plead I mustall bootless unto themtherefore I tell my sorrows to the stoneswho though they cannot answer my distressyet in some sort they are better than the tribunesfor that they will not intercept my talewhen I do weep they humbly at my feetreceive my tears and seem to weep with meand were they but attired in grave weedsRome could afford no tribune like to thesea stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stonesa stone is silent and offendeth notand tribunes with their tongues doom men to deathbut wherefore standest thou with thy weapon drawnto rescue my two brothers from their deathfor which attempt the judges have pronouncedmy everlasting doom of banishmentO happy man they have befriended theewhy foolish Luus dost thou not perceivethat Rome is but a wilderness of tigerstigers must prey and Rome affords no preybut me and mine how happy art thou thenfrom these devourers to be banishedbut who comes with our brother Marcus hereTitus prepare thy aged eyes to weepor if not so thy noble heart to breakI bring consuming sorrow to thine agewill it consume me let me see it thenthis was thy daughterwhy Marcus so she isay me this object kills mefaint-hearted boy arise and look upon herspeak Lavinia what accursed handhath made thee handless in thy fathers sightwhat fool hath added water to the seaor brought a faggot to bright-burning Troymy grief was at the height before thou camestand now like Nilus it disdaineth boundsgive me a sword iull chop off my hands toofor they have fought for Rome and all in vainand they have nursed this woe in feeding lifein bootless prayer have they been held upand they have served me to effectless usenow all the service I require of themis that the one will help to cut the otheritis well Lavinia that thou hast no handsfor hands to do Rome service are but vainspeak gentle sister who hath martyred theeO that delightful engine of her thoughtsthat blabbed them with such pleasing eloquenceis torn from forth that pretty hollow cagewhere like a sweet melodious bird it sungsweet varied notes enchanting every earO say thou for her who hath done this deedO thus I found her straying in the parkseeking to hide herself as doth the deerthat hath received some unrecuring woundit was my dear and he that wounded herhath hurt me more than had he killed me deadfor now I stand as one upon a rockenvironed with a wilderness of seawho marks the waxing tide grow wave by waveexpecting ever when some envious surgewill in his brinish bowels swallow himthis way to death my wretched sons are gonehere stands my other son a banished manand here my brother weeping at my woesbut that which gives my soul the greatest spurnis dear Lavinia dearer than my soulhad I but seen thy picture in this plightit would have madded me what shall I donow I behold thy lively body sothou hast no hands to wipe away thy tearsnor tongue to tell me who hath martyred theethy husband he is dead and for his deaththy brothers are condemned and dead by thislook Marcus ah son Luus look on herwhen I did name her brothers then fresh tearsstood on her cheeks as doth the honey-dewupon a gathered lily almost witheredperchance she weeps because they killed her husbandperchance because she knows them innocentif they did kill thy husband then be joyfulbecause the law hath taen revenge on themno no they would not do so foul a deedwitness the sorrow that their sister makesgentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lipsor make some sign how I may do thee easeshall thy good uncle and thy brother Luusand thou and I sit round about some fountainlooking all downwards to behold our cheekshow they are stained like meadows yet not drywith miry alime left on them by a floodand in the fountain shall we gaze so longtill the fresh taste be taken from that clearnessand made a brine-pit with our bitter tearsor shall we cut away our hands like thineor shall we bite our tongues and in dumb showspass the remainder of our hateful dayswhat shall we do let us that have our tonguesplot some device of further miseryto make us wondered at in time to comesweet father cease your tears for at your griefsee how my wretched sister sobs and weepspatience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyesah Marcus Marcus brother well I wotthy napkin cannot drink a tear of minefor thou poor man hast drowned it with thine ownah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeksmark Marcus mark I understand her signshad she a tongue to speak now would she saythat to her brother which I said to theehis napkin with his true tears all bewetcan do no service on her sorrowful cheeksO what a sympathy of woe is thisas far from help as limbo is from blissTitus Andronicus my lord the emperorsends thee this word that if thou love thy sonslet Marcus Luus or thyself old Titusor any one of you chop off your handand send it to the king he for the samewill send thee hither both thy sons aliveand that shall be the ransom for their faultO gracious emperor O gentle Aarondid ever raven sing so like a larkthat gives sweet tidings of the suns uprisewith all my heart iull send the emperor my handgood Aaron wilt thou help to chop it offstay father for that noble hand of thinethat hath thrown down so many enemiesshall not be sent my hand will serve the turnmy youth can better spare my blood than youand therefore mine shall save my brothers liveswhich of your hands hath not defended Romeand reared aloft the bloody battle-axewriting destruction on the enemys castleO none of both but are of high desertmy hand hath been but idle let it serveto ransom my two nephews from their deaththen have I kept it to a worthy endnay come agree whose hand shall go alongfor fear they die before their pardon comemy hand shall goby heaven it shall not gosirs strive no more such withered herbs as theseare meet for plucking up and therefore minesweet father if I shall be thought thy sonlet me redeem my brothers both from deathand for our fathers sake and mothers carenow let me show a brothers love to theeagree between you I will spare my handthen iull go fetch an axebut I will use the axecome hither Aaron iull deceive them bothlend me thy hand and I will give thee mineif that be called deceit I will be honestand never whilst I live deceive men sobut iull deceive you in another sortand that youll say ere half an hour passnow stay your strife what shall be is dispatchedgood Aaron give his majesty my handtell him it was a hand that warded himfrom thousand dangers bid him bury itmore hath it merited that let it haveas for my sons say I account of themas jewels purchased at an easy priceand yet dear too because I bought mine ownI go Andronicus and for thy handlook by and by to have thy sons with theetheir heads I mean O how this villanydoth fat me with the very thoughts of itlet fools do good and fair men call for graceaaron will have his soul black like his faceO here I lift this one hand up to heavenand how this feeble ruin to the earthif any power pities wretched tearsto that I callwhat wilt thou kneel with medo then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayersor with our sighs well breathe the welkin dimand stain the sun with fog as sometime cloudswhen they do hug him in their melting bosomsO brother speak with possibilitiesand do not break into these deep extremesis not my sorrow deep having no bottomthen be my passions bottomless with thembut yet let reason govern thy lamentif there were reason for these miseriesthen into limits could I bind my woeswhen heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflowif the winds rage doth not the sea wax madthreatning the welkin with his big-swoln faceand wilt thou have a reason for this coilI am the sea hark how her sighs do blowshe is the weeping welkin I the earththen must my sea be moved with her sighsthen must my earth with her continual tearsbecome a deluge overflowed and drownedfor why my bowels cannot hide her woesbut like a drunkard must I vomit themthen give me leave for losers will have leaveto ease their stomachs with their bitter tonguesworthy Andronicus ill art thou repaidfor that good hand thou sentest the emperorhere are the heads of thy two noble sonsand heres thy hand in scorn to thee sent backthy griefs their sports thy resolution mockedthat woe is me to think upon thy woesmore than remembrance of my fathers deathnow let hottna cool in Silyand be my heart an ever burning hellthese miseries are more than may be borneto weep with them that weep doth ease some dealbut sorrow flouted at is double deathah that this sight should make so deep a woundand yet detested life not shrink thereatthat ever death should let life bear his namewhere life hath no more interest but to breathealas poor heart that kiss is comfortlessas frozen water to a starved snakewhen will this fearful slumber have an endnow farewell flattery die Andronicusthou dost not slumber see thy two sons headsthy war-like hand thy mangled daughter herethy other banished son with this dear sightstruck pale and bloodless and thy brother Ieven like a stony image cold and numbah now no more will I control thy griefsrent off thy silver hair thy other handgnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sightthe closing up of our most wretched eyesnow is a time to storm why art thou stillha ha hawhy dost thou laugh it fits not with this hourwhy I have not another tear to shedbesides this sorrow is an enemyand would usurp upon my watery eyesand make them blind with tributary tearsthen which way shall I find revenges cavefor these two heads do seem to speak to meand threat me I shall never come to blisstill all these mischiefs be returned againeven in their throats that have committed themcome let me see what task I have to doyou heavy people rcle me aboutthat I may turn me to each one of youand swear unto my soul to right your wrongsthe vow is made come brother take a headand in this hand the other will I bearLavinia thou shalt be employed in these thingsbear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teethas for thee boy go get thee from my sightthou art an exile and thou must not stayhie to the Goths and raise an army thereand if you love me as I think you dolets kiss and part for we have much to dofarewell Andronicus my noble fatherthe woefullest man that ever lived in Romefarewell proud Rome till Luus come againhe leaves his pledges dearer than his lifefarewell Lavinia my noble sisterO would thou wert as thou tofore hast beenbut now nor Luus nor Lavinia livesbut in oblivion and hateful griefsif Luus live he will requite your wrongsand make proud Saturnine and his empressbeg at the gates like Tarquin and his queennow will I to the Goths and raise a powerto be revenged on Rome and Saturnineso so now sit and look you eat no morethan will preserve just so much strength in usas will revenge these bitter woes of oursMarcus unknit that sorrow-wreathen knotthy niece and I poor creatures want our handsand cannot passionate our ten-fold griefwith folded arms this poor right hand of mineis left to tyrannize upon my breastand when my heart all mad with miserybeats in this hollow prison of my fleshthen thus I thump it downthou map of woe that thus dost talk in signswhen thy poor heart beats with outrageous beatingthou canst not strike it thus to make it stillwound it with sighing girl kill it with groansor get some little knife between thy teethand just against thy heart make thou a holethat all the tears that thy poor eyes let fallmay run into that sink and soaking indrown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tearsfie brother fie teach her not thus to laysuch violent hands upon her tender lifehow now has sorrow made thee dote alreadywhy Marcus no man should be mad but Iwhat violent hands can she lay on her lifeah wherefore dost thou urge the name of handsto bidaeas tell the tale twice oerhow Troy was burnt and he made miserableO handle not the theme to talk of handslest we remember still that we have nonefie fie how franticly I square my talkas if we should forget we had no handsif Marcus did not name the word of handscome lets fall to and gentle girl eat thishere is no drink hark Marcus what she saysI can interpret all her martyred signsshe says she drinks no other drink but tearsbrewed with her sorrow mashed upon her cheeksspeechless complainer I will learn thy thoughtin thy dumb action will I be as perfectas begging hermits in their holy prayersthou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heavennor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a signbut I of these will wrest an alphabetand by still practice learn to know thy meaninggood grandsire leave these bitter deep lamentsmake my aunt merry with some pleasing talealas the tender boy in passion moveddoth weep to see his grandsires heavinesspeace tender sapling thou art made of tearsand tears will quickly melt thy life awaywhat dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knifeat that that I have killed my lord a flyout on thee murderer thou killest my heartmine eyes are cloyed with view of tyrannya deed of death done on the innocentbecomes not Titus brother get thee goneI see thou art not for my companyalas my lord I have but killed a flybut how if that fly had a father and a motherhow would he hang his slender gilded wingsand buzz lamenting doings in the airpoor harmless flythat with his pretty buzzing melodycame here to make us merry and thou hast killed himpardon me sir it was a black ill-favoured flylike to the empress Moor therefore I killed himthen pardon me for reprehending theefor thou hast done a charitable deedgive me thy knife I will insult on himflattering myself as if it were the Moorcome hither purposely to poison metheres for thyself and thats for Tamoraah sirrahyet I think we are not brought so lowbut that between us we can kill a flythat comes in likeness of a coal-black Mooralas poor man grief has so wrought on himhe takes false shadows for true substancescome take away Lavinia go with meiull to thy closet and go read with theesad stories chanced in the times of oldcome boy and go with me thy sight is youngand thou shalt read when mine begins to dazzlehelp grandsire help my aunt Laviniafollows me everywhere I know not whygood uncle Marcus see how swift she comesalas sweet aunt I know not what you meanstand by me Luus do not fear thine auntshe loves thee boy too well to do thee harmay when my father was in Rome she didwhat means my niece Lavinia by these signsfear her not Luus somewhat doth she meansee Luus see how much she makes of theesomewhither would she have thee go with herah boy Cornelia never with more careread to her sons than she hath read to theesweet poetry and Tullys Oratorcanst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thusmy lord I know not I nor can I guessunless some fit or frenzy do possess herfor I have heard my grandsire say full oftextremity of griefs would make men madand I have read that Hecuba of Troyran mad through sorrow that made me to fearalthough my lord I know my noble auntloves me as dear as eer my mother didand would not but in fury fright my youthwhich made me down to throw my books and flycauseless perhaps but pardon me sweet auntand madam if my uncle Marcus goI will most willingly attend your ladyshipLuus I willhow now Lavinia Marcus what means thissome book there is that she desires to seewhich is it girl of these open them boybut thou art deeper read and better skilledcome and take choice of all my libraryand so beguile thy sorrow till the heavensreveal the damned contriver of this deedwhy lifts she up her arms in sequence thusI think she means that there was more than oneconfederate in the fact ay more there wasor else to heaven she heaves them for revengeLuus what book is that she tosseth sograndsire itis Ovids Metamorphosesmy mother gave it mefor love of her thats goneperhaps she culled it from among the restsoft see how busily she turns the leaveswhat would she find Lavinia shall I readthis is the tragic tale of Philomeland treats of Tereus treason and his rapeand rape I fear was root of thine annoysee brother see note how she quotes the leavesLavinia wert thou thus surprised sweet girlravished and wronged as Philomela wasforced in the ruthless vast and gloomy woodssee seeay such a place there is where we did huntO had we never never hunted therepatterned by that the poet here describesby nature made for murders and for rapesO why should nature build so foul a denunless the gods delight in tragediesgive signs sweet girl for here are none but friendswhat Roman lord it was durst do the deedor slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erstthat left the camp to sin in Lucrece bedsit down sweet niece brother sit down by meApollo Pallas Jove or Mercuryinspire me that I may this treason findmy lord look here look here Laviniathis sandy plot is plain guide if thou canstthis after meI have writ my namewithout the help of any hand at allcursed be that heart that forced us to this shiftwrite thou good niece and here display at lastwhat God will have discovered for revengeheaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plainthat we may know the traitors and the truthO do you read my lord what she hath writstuprum Chiron Demetriuswhat what the lustful sons of Tamoraperformers of this heinous bloody deedmagnI dominator polItam lentus audis scelera tam lentus videsO calm thee gentle lord although I knowthere is enough written upon this earthto stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughtsand arm the minds of infants to exclaimsmy lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneeland kneel sweet boy the Roman Hectors hopeand swear with me as with the woeful fereand father of that chaste dishonoured damelord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece rapethat we will prosecute by good advicemortal revenge upon these traitorous Gothsand see their blood or die with this reproachitis sure enough an you knew howbut if you hunt these bear-whelps then bewarethe dam will wake an if she wind you onceshes with the lion deeply still in leagueand lulls him whilst she playeth on her backand when he sleeps will she do what she listyoure a young huntsman Marcus let it aloneand come I will go get a leaf of brassand with a gad of steel will write these wordsand lay it by the angry northern windwill blow these sands like Sibyls leaves abroadand wheres your lesson then boy what say youI say my lord that if I were a mantheir mothers bed-chamber should not be safefor these bad bondmen to the yoke of Romeay thats my boy thy father hath full oftfor his ungrateful country done the likeand uncle so will I an if I livecome go with me into mine armouryLuus iull fit thee and withal my boyshall carry from me to the empress sonspresents that I intend

iull go brave it at the courtay marry will we sir and well be waited onO heavens can you hear a good man groanand not relent or not compassion himMarcus attend him in his ecstasythat hath more scars of sorrow in his heartthan foemens marks upon his battered shieldbut yet so just that he will not revengerevenge ye heavens for old AndronicusDemetrius heres the son of Luushe hath some message to deliver usay some mad message from his mad grandfathermy lords with all the humbleness I mayI greet your honours from Andronicusand pray the Roman gods confound you bothgramercy lovely

empress well afootshe would applaud Andronicus conceitbut let her rest in her unrest awhileand now young lords wast not a happy starled us to Rome strangers and more than socaptives to be advanced to this heightit did me good before the palace gateto brave the tribune in his brothers hearingbut me more good to see so great a lordbasely insinuate and send us giftshad he not reason lord Demetriusdid you not use his daughter very friendlyI would we had a thousand Roman damesat such a bay by turn to serve our lusta charitable wish and full of lovehere lacks but your mother for to say amenand that would she for twenty thousand morecome let us go and pray to all the godsfor our beloved mother in her painspray to the devils the gods have given us overwhy do the

used in such contemptmy lords you know as do the mightful godshowever these disturbers of our peacebuzz in the peoples ears there nought hath passedbut even with law against the wilful sonsof old Andronicus and what an ifhis sorrows have so overwhelmed his witsshall we be thus afflicted in his wreakshis fits his frenzy and his bitternessand now he writes to heaven for his redresssee heres to Jove and this to Mercurythis to Apollo this to the god of warsweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Romewhats this but libelling against the senateand blazoning our injustice every wherea goodly humour is it not my lordsas who would say in Rome no justice werebut if I live his feigned ecstasiesshall be no shelter to these outragesbut he and his shall know that justice livesin Saturninus health whom if she sleephell so awake as she in fury shallcut off the proudest conspirator that livesmy gracious lord my lovely Saturninelord of my life commander of my thoughtscalm thee and bear the faults of Titus agethe effects of sorrow for his valiant sonswhose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heartand rather comfort his distressed plightthan prosecute the meanest or the bestfor these contemptswhy thus it shall becomehigh-witted Tamora to gloze with allbut Titus I have touched thee to the quickthy life-blood out if Aaron now be wisethen is all safe the anchors in the porthow now good fellow wouldst thou speak with usyea forsooth an your mistership be emperialempress I am but yonder sits the emperoritis he God and saint Stephen give you

brought up a neck to a fair enddespiteful and intolerable wrongsshall I endure this monstrous villanyI know from whence this same device proceedsmay this be borne as if his traitorous sonsthat died by law for murder of our brotherhave by my means been butchered wrongfullygo drag the villain hither by the hairnor age nor honour shall shape privilegefor this proud mock iull be thy slaughtermansly frantic wretch that holpest to make me greatin hope thyself should govern Rome and mewhat news with thee Miliusarm arm my lord Rome never had more causethe Goths have gathered head and with a powerof high-resolved men bent to the spoilthey hither march amain under conductof Luus son to old Andronicuswho threats in course of this revenge to doas much as ever Coriolanus didis war-like Luus general of the Gothsthese tidings nip me and I hang the headas flowers with frost or grass beat down with stormsay now begin our sorrows to approachitis he the common people love so muchmyself hath often heard them saywhen I have walked like a private manthat Luus banishment was wrongfullyand they have wished that Luus were their emperorwhy should you fear is not your ty strongay but the tizens favour Luusand will revolt from me to succour himking be thy thoughts imperious like thy nameis the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in itthe eagle suffers little birds to singand is not careful what they mean therebyknowing that with the shadow of his wingshe can at pleasure stint their melodyeven so mayst thou the giddy men of Romethen cheer thy spirit for know thou emperorI will enchant the old Andronicuswith words more sweet and yet more dangerousthan baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheepwhenas the one is wounded with the baitthe other rotted with delious feedbut he will not entreat his son for usif Tamora entreat him then he willfor I can smooth and fill his aged earwith golden promises that were his heartalmost impregnable his old ears deafyet should both ear and heart obey my tonguego thou before be our ambassadorsay that the emperor requests a parleyof war-like Luus and appoint the meetingeven at his fathers house the old AndronicusMilius do this message honourablyand if he stand on hostage for his safetybid him demand what pledge will please him bestyour bidding shall I do effectuallynow will I to that old Andronicusand temper him with all the art I haveto pluck proud Luus from the war-like Gothsand now sweet emperor be blithe againand bury all thy fear in my devicesthen go successantly and plead to himapproved warriors and my faithful friendsI have received letters from great Romewhich signify what hate they bear their emperorand how desirous of our sight they aretherefore great lords be as your titles witnessimperious and impatient of your wrongsand wherein Rome hath done you any scathlet him make treble satisfactionbrave slip sprung from the great Andronicuswhose name was once our terror now our comfortwhose high exploits and honourable deedsingrateful Rome requites with foul contemptbe bold in us well follow where thou leadestlike stinging bees in hottest summers dayled by their master to the flowered fieldsand be avenged on cursed Tamoraand as he saith so say we all with himI humbly thank him and I thank you allbut who comes here led by a lusty Gothrenowned Luus from our troops I strayedto gaze upon a ruinous monasteryand as I earnestly did fix mine eyeupon the wasted building suddenlyI heard a child cry underneath a wallI made unto the noise when soon I heardthe crying babe controlled with this discoursepeace tawny slave half me and half thy damdid not thy hue bewray whose brat thou arthad nature lent thee but thy mothers lookvillain thou mightst have been an emperorbut where the bull and cow are both milk-whitethey never do beget a coal-black calfpeace villain peace even thus he rates the babefor I must bear thee to a trusty Gothwho when he knows thou art the empress babewill hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake with this my weapon drawn I rushed upon himsurprised him suddenly and brought him hitherto use as you think needful of the manO worthy Goth this is the incarnate devilthat robbed Andronicus of his good handthis is the pearl that pleased your empress eyeand heres the base fruit of his burning lustsay wall-eyed slave whither wouldst thou conveythis growing image of thy fiend-like facewhy dost not speak what deaf not a worda halter soldiers hang him on this treeand by his side his fruit of bastardytouch not the boy he is of royal bloodtoo like the sire for ever being goodfirst hang the child that he may see it sprawla sight to vex the fathers soul withalget me a ladderLuus save the childand bear it from me to the empressif thou do this iull show thee wondrous thingsthat highly may advantage thee to hearif thou wilt not befall what may befalliull speak no more but Vengeance rot you all say on and if it please me which thou speakestthy child shall live and I will see it nourishedan if it please thee why assure thee Luusitwill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speakfor I must talk of murders rapes and massacresacts of black night abominable deedscomplots of mischief treason villaniesruthful to hear yet piteously performedand this shall all be buried by my deathunless thou swear to me my child shall livetell on thy mind I say thy child shall liveswear that he shall and then I will beginwho should I swear by thou believest no godthat granted how canst thou believe an oathwhat if I do not as indeed I do notyet for I know thou art religiousand hast a thing within thee called consencewith twenty popish tricks and ceremonieswhich I have seen thee careful to observetherefore I urge thy oath for that I knowan idiot holds his bauble for a godand keeps the oath which by that god he swearsto that iull urge him therefore thou shalt vowby that same god what god soeer it bethat thou adorest and hast in reverenceto save my boy to nourish and bring him upor else I will discover nought to theeeven by my god I swear to thee I willfirst know thou I begot him on the empressO most insatiate and luxurious womantut Luus this was but a deed of charityto that which thou shalt hear of me anonitwas her two sons that murdered Bassianusthey cut thy sisters tongue and ravished herand cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawestO detestable villain callest thou that trimmingwhy she was washed and cut and trimmed and itwastrim sport for them that had the doing of itO barbarous beastly villains like thyselfindeed I was their tutor to instruct themthat codding spirit had they from their motheras sure a card as ever won the setthat bloody mind I think they learned of meas true a dog as ever fought at headwell let my deeds be witness of my worthI trained thy brethren to that guileful holewhere the dead corpse of Bassianus layI wrote the letter that thy father foundand hid the gold within the letter mentionedconfederate with the queen and her two sonsand what not done that thou hast cause to ruewherein I had no stroke of mischief in itI played the cheater for thy fathers handand when I had it drew myself apartand almost broke my heart with extreme laughterI pryed me through the crevice of a wallwhen for his hand he had his two sons headsbeheld his tears and laughed so heartilythat both mine eyes were rainy like to hisand when I told the empress of this sportshe swounded almost at my pleasing taleand for my tidings gave me twenty kisseswhat canst thou say all this and never blushay like a black dog as the saying isart thou not sorry for these heinous deedsay that I had not done a thousand moreeven now I curse the day and yet I thinkfew come within the compass of my cursewherein I did not some notorious illas kill a man or else devise his deathravish a maid or plot the way to do itaccuse some innocent and forswear myselfset deadly enmity between two friendsmake poor mens cattle break their necksset fire on barns and hay-stacks in the nightand bid the owners quench them with their tearsoft have I digged up dead men from their gravesand set them upright at their dear friends doorseven when their sorrows almost were forgotand on their skins as on the bark of treeshave with my knife carved in Roman letterslet not your sorrow die though I am dead trust I have done a thousand dreadful thingsas willingly as one would kill a flyand nothing grieves me heartily indeedbut that I cannot do ten thousand morebring down the devil for he must not dieso sweet a death as hanging presentlyif there be devils would I were a devilto live and burn in everlasting fireso I might have your company in hellbut to torment you with my bitter tonguesirs stop his mouth and let him speak no moremy lord there is a messenger from Romedesires to be admitted to your presencelet him come nearwelcome Milius whats the news from Romelord Luus and you princes of the Gothsthe Roman emperor greets you all by meand for he understands you are in armshe craves a parley at your fathers housewilling you to demand your hostagesand they shall be immediately deliveredwhat says our generalMilius let the emperor give his pledgesunto my father and my uncle Marcusand we will come march awaythus in this strange and sad habilimentI will encounter with Andronicusand say I am revenge sent from belowto join with him and right his heinous wrongsknock at his study where they say he keepsto ruminate strange plots of dire revengetell him revenge is come to join with himand work confusion on his enemieswho doth molest my contemplationis it your trick to make me ope the doorthat so my sad decrees may fly awayand all my study be to no effectyou are deceived for what I mean to dosee here in bloody lines I have set downand what is written shall be executedTitus I am come to talk with theeno not a word how can I grace my talkwanting a hand to give it actionthou hast the odds of me therefore no moreif thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with meI am not mad I know thee well enoughwitness this wretched stump witness these crimson lineswitness these trenches made by grief and carewitness the tiring day and heavy nightwitness all sorrow that I know thee wellfor our proud empress mighty Tamorais not thy coming for my other handknow thou sad man I am not Tamorashe is thy enemy and I thy friendI am revenge sent from the infernal kingdomto ease the gnawing vulture of thy mindby working wreakful vengeance on thy foescome down and welcome me to this worlds lightconfer with me of murder and of deaththeres not a hollow cave or lurking-placeno vast obscurity or misty valewhere bloody murder or detested rapecan couch for fear but I will find them outand in their ears tell

ere I come to theelo by thy side where Rape and murder standsnow give some surance that thou art revengestab them or tear them on thy chariot-wheelsand then iull come and be thy waggonerand whirl along with thee about the globeprovide two proper palfreys black as jetto hale thy vengeful waggon swift awayand find out murderers in their guilty cavesand when thy car is loaden with their headsI will dismount and by the waggon-wheeltrot like a servile footman all day longeven from Hyperions rising in the eastuntil his very downfall in the seaand day by day iull do this heavy taskso thou destroy Rapine and murder therethese are my ministers and come with meare these thy ministers what are they calledrapine and murder therefore called socause they take vengeance of such kind of mengood lord how like the empress sons they areand you the empress but we worldly menhave miserable mad mistaking eyesO sweet revenge now do I come to theeand if one arms embracement will content theeI will embrace thee in it by and bythis closing with him fits his lunacywhateer I forge to feed his brain-sick fitsdo you uphold and maintain in your speechesfor now he firmly takes me for revengeand being credulous in this mad thoughtiull make him send for Luus his sonand whilst I at a banquet hold him sureiull find some cunning practice out of handto scatter and disperse the giddy Gothsor at the least make them his enemiessee here he comes and I must ply my themelong have I been forlorn and all for theewelcome dread fury to my woeful houserapine and

thee do on them some violent deaththey have been violent to me and minewell hast thou lessoned us this shall we dobut would it please thee good Andronicusto send for Luus thy thrice-valiant sonwho leads towards Rome a band of war-like Gothsand bid him come and banquet at thy housewhen he is here even at thy solemn feastI will bring in the empress and her sonsthe emperor himself and

your highness and your empresswe are beholding to you good Andronicusan if your highness knew my heart you weremy lord the emperor resolve me thiswas it well done of rash virginiusto slay his daughter with his own right handbecause she was enforced stained and defloweredit was Andronicusyour reason mighty lordbecause the girl should not survive her shameand by her presence still renew his sorrowsa reason mighty strong and effectuala pattern precedent and lively warrantfor me most wretched to perform the likedie die Lavinia and thy shame with theeand with thy shame thy fathers sorrow diewhat hast thou done unnatural and unkindkilled her for whom my tears have made me blindI am as woeful as virginius wasand have a thousand times more cause than heto do this outrage and it is now donewhat was she ravished tell who did the deedwillit please you eat willit please your highness feedwhy hast thou slain thine only daughter thusnot I itwas Chiron and Demetriusthey ravished her and cut away her tongueand they itwas they that did her all this wronggo fetch them hither to us presentlywhy there they are both baked in that piewhereof their mother daintily hath fedeating the flesh that she herself hath breditis true itis true witness my knifes sharp pointdie frantic wretch for this accursed deedcan the sons eye behold his father bleedtheres meed for meed death for a deadly deedyou sad-faced men people and sons of Romeby uproar severed like a flight of fowlscattered by winds and high tempestuous gustsO let me teach you how to knit againthis scattered corn into one mutual sheafthese broken limbs again into one bodylest Rome herself be bane unto herselfand she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy tolike a forlorn and desperate castawaydo shameful execution on herselfbut if my frosty signs and chaps of agegrave witnesses of true experiencecannot induce you to attend my wordsspeak Romes dear friend as erst our ancestorwhen with his solemn tongue he did discourseto love-sick Didos sad attending earthe story of that baleful burning nightwhen subtle Greeks surprised king Priams Troytell us what Sinon hath bewitched our earsor who hath brought the fatal engine inthat gives our Troy our Rome the civil woundmy heart is not compact of flint nor steelnor can I utter all our bitter griefbut floods of tears will drown my oratoryand break my very utterance even in the timewhen it should move you to attend me mostlending your kind commiserationhere is a captain let him tell the taleyour hearts will throb and weep to hear him speakthen noble auditory be it known to youthat cursed Chiron and Demetriuswere they that murdered our emperors brotherand they it was that ravished our sisterfor their fell faults our brothers were beheadedour fathers tears despised and basely cozenedof that true hand that fought Romes quarrel outand sent her enemies unto the gravelastly myself unkindly banishedthe gates shut on me and turned weeping outto beg relief among Romes enemieswho drowned their enmity in my true tearsand oped their arms to embrace me as a friendand I am the turned forth be it known to youthat have preserved her welfare in my bloodand from her bosom took the enemys pointsheathing the steel in my adventurous bodyalas you know I am no vaunter Imy scars can witness dumb although they arethat my report is just and full of truthbut soft methinks I do digress too muchting my worthless praise O pardon mefor when no friends are by men praise themselvesnow is my turn to speak behold this childof this was Tamora deliveredthe issue of an irreligious Moorchief architect and plotter of these woesthe villain is alive in Titus housedamned as he is to witness this is truenow judge what cause had Titus to revengethese wrongs unspeakable past patienceor more than any living man could bearnow you have heard the truth what say you Romanshave we done aught amiss show us whereinand from the place where you behold us nowthe poor remainder of AndronIwill hand in hand all headlong cast us downand on the ragged stones beat forth our brainsand make a mutual closure of our housespeak Romans speak and if you say we shalllo hand in hand Luus and I will fallcome come thou reverend man of Romeand bring our emperor gently in thy handLuus our emperor for well I knowthe common voice do cry it shall be soLuus all hail Romes royal emperorgo go into old Titus sorrowful houseand hither hale that misbelieving Moorto be adjudged some direful slaughtering deathas punishment for his most wicked lifeLuus all hail Romes gracious governorthanks gentle Romans may I govern soto heal Romes harms and wipe away her woebut gentle people give me aim awhilefor nature puts me to a heavy taskstand all aloof but uncle draw you nearto shed obsequious tears upon this trunkO take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lipsthese sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stained facethe last true duties of thy noble sontear for tear and loving kiss for kissthy brother Marcus tenders on thy lipsO were the sum of these that I should paycountless and infinite yet would I pay themcome hither boy come come and learn of usto melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee wellmany a time he danced thee on his kneesung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillowmany a matter hath he told to theemeet and agreeing with thine infancyin that respect then like a loving childshed yet some small drops from thy tender springbecause kind nature doth require it sofriends should assoate friends in grief and woebid him farewell commit him to the gravedo him that kindness and take leave of himO grandsire grandsire even with all my heartwould I were dead so you did live againO lord I cannot speak to him for weepingmy tears will choke me if I ope my mouthyou sad AndronI have done with woesgive sentence on this execrable wretchthat hath been breeder of these dire eventsset him breast-deep in earth and famish himthere let him stand and rave and cry for foodif any one relieves or pities himfor the offence he dies this is our doomsome stay to see him fastened in the earthO why should wrath be mute and fury dumbI am no baby I that with base prayersI should repent the evils I have doneten thousand worse than ever yet I didwould I perform if I might have my willif one good deed in all my life I didI do repent it from my very soulsome loving friends convey the emperor henceand give him burial in his fathers gravemy father and Lavinia shall forthwithbe closed in our households monumentas for that heinous tiger Tamorano funeral rite nor man in mournful weedsno mournful bell shall ring her burialbut throw her forth to beasts and birds of preyher life was beast-like and devoid of pityand being so shall have like want of pitysee justice done on Aaron that damned Moorby whom our heavy haps had their beginningthen afterwards to order well the statethat like events may neer it ruinatefrom fairest creatures we desire increasethat thereby beautys rose might never diebut as the riper should by time deceasehis tender heir might bear his memorybut thou contracted to thine own bright eyesfeedest thy lights flame with self-substantial fuelmaking a famine where abundance liesthy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruelthou that art now the worlds fresh ornamentand only herald to the gaudy springwithin thine own bud buriest thy contentand tender churl makest waste in niggardingpity the world or else this glutton beto eat the worlds due by the grave and theewhen forty winters shall besiege thy browand dig deep trenches in thy beautys fieldthy youths proud livery so gazed on nowwill be a tattered weed of small worth heldthen being asked where all thy beauty lieswhere all the treasure of thy lusty daysto say within thine own deep sunken eyeswere an all-eating shame and thriftless praisehow much more praise deserved thy beautys useif thou couldst answer this fair child of mineshall sum my count and make my old excuseproving his beauty by succession thinethis were to be new made when thou art oldand see thy blood warm when thou feelest it coldlook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewestnow is the time that face should form anotherwhose fresh repair if now thou not renewestthou dost beguile the world unbless some motherfor where is she so fair whose uneared wombdisdains the tillage of thy husbandryor who is he so fond will be the tombof his self-love to stop posteritythou art thy mothers glass and she in theecalls back the lovely April of her primeso thou through windows of thine age shalt seedespite of wrinkles this thy golden timebut if thou live remembered not to bedie single and thine image dies with theeunthrifty loveliness why dost thou spendupon thy self thy beautys legacynatures bequest gives nothing but doth lendand being frank she lends to those are freethen beauteous niggard why dost thou abusethe bounteous largess given thee to giveprofitless usurer why dost thou useso great a sum of sums yet canst not livefor having traffic with thy self alonethou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceivethen how when nature calls thee to be gonewhat acceptable audit canst thou leavethy unused beauty must be tombed with theewhich used lives th executor to bethose hours that with gentle work did framethe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwellwill play the tyrants to the very sameand that unfair which fairly doth excelfor never-resting time leads summer onto hideous winter and confounds him theresap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gonebeauty oer-snowed and bareness every wherethen were not summers distillation lefta liquid prisoner pent in walls of glassbeautys effect with beauty were bereftnor it nor no remembrance what it wasbut flowers distilled though they with winter meetleese but their show their substance still lives sweetthen let not winters ragged hand defacein thee thy summer ere thou be distilledmake sweet some vial treasure thou some placewith beautys treasure ere it be self-killedthat use is not forbidden usurywhich happies those that pay the willing loanthats for thy self to breed another theeor ten times happier be it ten for oneten times thy self were happier than thou artif ten of thine ten times refigured theethen what could death do if thou shouldst departleaving thee living in posteritybe not self-willed for thou art much too fairto be deaths conquest and make worms thine heirlo in the orient when the gracious lightlifts up his burning head each under eyedoth homage to his new-appearing sightserving with looks his sacred majestyand having climbed the steep-up heavenly hillresembling strong youth in his middle ageyet mortal looks adore his beauty stillattending on his golden pilgrimagebut when from highmost pitch with weary carlike feeble age he reeleth from the daythe eyes fore duteous now converted arefrom his low tract and look another wayso thou thyself outgoing in thy noonunlooked on diest unless thou get a sonmusic to hear why hearest thou music sadlysweets with sweets war not joy delights in joywhy lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladlyor else receivest with pleasure thine annoyif the true concord of well-tuned soundsby unions married do offend thine earthey do but sweetly chide thee who confoundsin singleness the parts that thou shouldst bearmark how one string sweet husband to anotherstrikes each in each by mutual orderingresembling sire and child and happy motherwho all in one one pleasing note do singwhose speechless song being many seeming onesings this to thee thou single wilt prove noneis it for fear to wet a widows eyethat thou consumest thy self in single lifeah if thou issueless shalt hap to diethe world will wail thee like a makeless wifethe world will be thy widow and still weepthat thou no form of thee hast left behindwhen every private widow well may keepby childrens eyes her husbands shape in mindlook what an unthrift in the world doth spendshifts but his place for still the world enjoys itbut beautys waste hath in the world an endand kept unused the user so destroys itno love toward others in that bosom sitsthat on himself such murdrous shame commitsfor shame deny that thou bearest love to anywho for thy self art so unprovidentgrant if thou wilt thou art beloved of manybut that thou none lovest is most evidentfor thou art so possessed with murderous hatethat gainst thy self thou stickest not to conspireseeking that beauteous roof to ruinatewhich to repair should be thy chief desireO change thy thought that I may change my mindshall hate be fairer lodged than gentle lovebe as thy presence is gracious and kindor to thyself at least kind-hearted provemake thee another self for love of methat beauty still may live in thine or theeas fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growestin one of thine from that which thou departestand that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowestthou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertestherein lives wisdom beauty and increasewithout this folly age and cold decayif all were minded so the times should ceaseand threescore year would make the world awaylet those whom nature hath not made for storeharsh featureless and rude barrenly perishlook whom she best endowed she gave thee morewhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherishshe carved thee for her seal and meant therebythou shouldst print more not let that copy diewhen I do count the clock that tells the timeand see the brave day sunk in hideous nightwhen I behold the violet past primeand sable curls all silvered oer with whitewhen lofty trees I see barren of leaveswhich erst from heat did canopy the herdand summers green all girded up in sheavesborne on the bier with white and bristly beardthen of thy beauty do I question makethat thou among the wastes of time must gosince sweets and beauties do themselves forsakeand die as fast as they see others growand nothing gainst Times scythe can make defencesave breed to brave him when he takes thee henceO that you were your self but love you areno longer yours than you your self here liveagainst this coming end you should prepareand your sweet semblance to some other giveso should that beauty which you hold in leasefind no determination then you wereyourself again after yourselfs deceasewhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bearwho lets so fair a house fall to decaywhich husbandry in honour might upholdagainst the stormy gusts of winters dayand barren rage of deaths eternal coldO none but unthrifts dear my love you knowyou had a father let your son say sonot from the stars do I my judgement pluckand yet methinks I have astronomybut not to tell of good or evil luckof plagues of dearths or seasons qualitynor can I fortune to brief minutes tellpointing to each his thunder rain and windor say with princes if it shall go wellby oft predict that I in heaven findbut from thine eyes my knowledge I deriveand constant stars in them I read such artas tru<th and beauty shall together thriveif from thyself to store thou wouldst convertor else of thee this I prognosticatethy end is truths and beautys doom and datewhen I consider every thing that growsholds in perfection but a little momentthat this huge stage presenteth nought but showswhereon the stars in secret influence commentwhen I perceive that men as plants increasecheered and checked even by the self-same skyvaunt in their youthful sap at height decreaseand wear their brave state out of memorythen the conceit of this inconstant staysets you most rich in youth before my sightwhere wasteful Time debateth with decayto change your day of youth to sullied nightand all in war with Time for love of youas he takes from you I engraft you newbut wherefore do not you a mightier waymake war upon this bloody tyrant Timeand fortify your self in your decaywith means more blessed than my barren rhymenow stand you on the top of happy hoursand many maiden gardens yet unsetwith virtuous wish would bear you living flowersmuch liker than your painted counterfeitso should the lines of life that life repairwhich this Times penl or my pupil penneither in inward worth nor outward faircan make you live your self in eyes of mento give away yourself keeps yourself stilland you must live drawn by your own sweet skillwho will believe my verse in time to comeif it were filled with your most high desertsthough yet heaven knows it is but as a tombwhich hides your life and shows not half your partsif I could write the beauty of your eyesand in fresh numbers number all your gracesthe age to come would say this poet liessuch heavenly touches neer touched earthly facesso should my papers yellowed with their agebe scorned like old men of less truth than tongueand your true rights be termed a poets rageand stretched metre of an antique songbut were some child of yours alive that timeyou should live twice--in it and in my rhymeshall I compare thee to a summers daythou art more lovely and more temperaterough winds do shake the darling buds of Mayand summers lease hath all too short a datesometime too hot the eye of heaven shinesand often is his gold complexion dimmedand every fair from fair sometime declinesby chance or natures changing course untrimmedbut thy eternal summer shall not fadenor lose possession of that fair thou owestnor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shadewhen in eternal lines to time thou growestso long as men can breathe or eyes can seeso long lives this and this gives life to theedevouring Time blunt thou the lions pawsand make the earth devour her own sweet broodpluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jawsand burn the long-lived phoenix in her bloodmake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetsand do whateer thou wilt swift-footed Timeto the wide world and all her fading sweetsbut I forbid thee one most heinous crimeO carve not with thy hours my loves fair brownor draw no lines there with thine antique penhim in thy course untainted do allowfor beautys pattern to succeeding menyet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrongmy love shall in my verse ever live younga womans face with natures own hand paintedhast thou the master mistress of my passiona womans gentle heart but not acquaintedwith shifting change as is false womens fashionan eye more bright than theirs less false in rollinggilding the object whereupon it gazetha man in hue all hues in his controllingwhich steals mens eyes and womens souls amazethand for a woman wert thou first createdtill nature as she wrought thee fell a-dotingand by addition me of thee defeatedby adding one thing to my purpose nothingbut since she pricked thee out for womens pleasuremine be thy love and thy loves use their treasureso is it not with me as with that musestirred by a painted beauty to his versewho heaven itself for ornament doth useand every fair with his fair doth rehearsemaking a couplement of proud comparewith sun and moon with earth and seas rich gemswith Aprils first-born flowers and all things rarethat heavens air in this huge rondure hemsO let me true in love but truly writeand then believe me my love is as fairas any mothers child though not so brightas those gold candles fixed in heavens airlet them say more that like of hearsay wellI will not praise that purpose not to sellmy glass shall not persuade me I am oldso long as youth and thou are of one datebut when in thee times furrows I beholdthen look I death my days should expiatefor all that beauty that doth cover theeis but the seemly raiment of my heartwhich in thy breast doth live as thine in mehow can I then be elder than thou artO therefore love be of thyself so waryas I not for myself but for thee willbearing thy heart which I will keep so charyas tender nurse her babe from faring illpresume not on thy heart when mine is slainthou gavest me thine not to give back againas an unperfect actor on the stagewho with his fear is put beside his partor some fierce thing replete with too much ragewhose strengths abundance weakens his own heartso I for fear of trust forget to saythe perfect ceremony of loves riteand in mine own loves strength seem to decayoercharged with burthen of mine own loves mightO let my looks be then the eloquenceand dumb presagers of my speaking breastwho plead for love and look for recompensemore than that tongue that more hath more expressedO learn to read what silent love hath writto hear with eyes belongs to loves fine witmine eye hath played the painter and hath stelledthy beautys form in table of my heartmy body is the frame wherein itis heldand perspective it is best painters artfor through the painter must you see his skillto find where your true image pictured lieswhich in my bosoms shop is hanging stillthat hath his windows glazed with thine eyesnow see what good turns eyes for eyes have donemine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for meare windows to my breast where-through the sundelights to peep to gaze therein on theeyet eyes this cunning want to grace their artthey draw but what they see know not the heartlet those who are in favour with their starsof public honour and proud titles boastwhilst I whom fortune of such triumph barsunlooked for joy in that I honour mostgreat princes favourites their fair leaves spreadbut as the marigold at the suns eyeand in themselves their pride lies buriedfor at a frown they in their glory diethe painful warrior famoused for fightafter a thousand victories once foiledis from the book of honour razed quiteand all the rest forgot for which he toiledthen happy I that love and am belovedwhere I may not remove nor be removedlord of my love to whom in vassalagethy merit hath my duty strongly knitto thee I send this written embassageto witness duty not to show my witduty so great which wit so poor as minemay make seem bare in wanting words to show itbut that I hope some good conceit of thinein thy souls thought all naked will bestow ittill whatsoever star that guides my movingpoints on me graciously with fair aspectand puts apparel on my tattered lovingto show me worthy of thy sweet respectthen may I dare to boast how I do love theetill then not show my head where thou mayst prove meweary with toil I haste me to my bedthe dear respose for limbs with travel tiredbut then begins a journey in my headto work my mind when bodys works expiredfor then my thoughts--from far where I abide--intend a zealous pilgrimage to theeand keep my drooping eyelids open widelooking on darkness which the blind do seesave that my souls imaginary sightpresents thy shadow to my sightless viewwhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly nightmakes black night beauteous and her old face newlo thus by day my limbs by night my mindfor thee and for myself no quiet findhow can I then return in happy plightthat am debarreed the benefit of restwhen days oppression is not eased by nightbut day by night and night by day oppressedand each though enemies to eithers reigndo in consent shake hands to torture methe one by toil the other to complainhow far I toil still farther off from theeI tell the day to please him thou art brightand dost him grace when clouds do blot the heavenso flatter I the swart-complexioned nightwhen sparkling stars twire not thou gildest the evenbut day doth daily draw my sorrows longerand night doth nightly make griefs length seem strongerwhen in disgrace with fortune and mens eyesI all alone beweep my outcast stateand trouble deaf heaven with my bootless criesand look upon myself and curse my fatewishing me like to one more rich in hopefeatured like him like him with friends possesseddesiring this mans art and that mans scopewith what I most enjoy contented leastyet in these thoughts my self almost despisinghaply I think on thee-- and then my statelike to the lark at break of day arisingfrom sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gatefor thy sweet love remembered such wealth bringsthat then I scorn to change my state with kingswhen to the sessions of sweet silent thoughtI summon up remembrance of things pastI sigh the lack of many a thing I soughtand with old woes new wail my dear times wastethen can I drown an eye unused to flowfor precious friends hid in deaths dateless nightand weep afresh loves long since cancelled woeand moan the expense of many a vanished sightthen can I grieve at grievances foregoneand heavily from woe to woe tell oerthe sad account of fore-bemoaned moanwhich I new pay as if not paid beforebut if the while I think on thee dear friendall losses are restored and sorrows endthy bosom is endeared with all heartswhich I by lacking have supposed deadand there reigns love and all loves loving partsand all those friends which I thought buriedhow many a holy and obsequious tearhath dear religious love stoln from mine eyeas interest of the dead which now appearbut things removed that hidden in thee liethou art the grave where buried love doth livehung with the trophies of my lovers gonewho all their parts of me to thee did givethat due of many now is thine alonetheir images I loved I view in theeand thou all they.hast all the all of meif thou survive my well-contented daywhen that churl death my bones with dust shall coverand shalt by fortune once more re-surveythese poor rude lines of thy deceased lovercompare them with the bettring of the timeand though they be outstripped by every penreserve them for my love not for their rhymeexceeded by the height of happier menO then vouchsafe me but this loving thoughthad my friends muse grown with this growing agea dearer birth than this his love had broughtto march in ranks of better equipagebut since he died and poets better provetheirs for their style iull read his for his lovefull many a glorious morning have I seenflatter the mountain tops with sovereign eyekissing with golden face the meadows greengilding pale streams with heavenly alchemyanon permit the basest clouds to ridewith ugly rack on his celestial faceand from the forlorn world his visage hidestealing unseen to west with this disgraceeven so my sun one early morn did shinewith all triumphant splendour on my browbut out alack he was but one hour minethe region cloud hath masked him from me nowyet him for this my love no whit disdainethsuns of the world may stain when heavens sun stainethwhy didst thou promise such a beauteous dayand make me travel forth without my cloakto let base clouds oertake me in my wayhiding thy bravery in their rotten smokeitis not enough that through the cloud thou breakto dry the rain on my storm-beaten facefor no man well of such a salve can speakthat heals the wound and cures not the disgracenor can thy shame give physic to my griefthough thou repent yet I have still the lossthe offenders sorrow lends but weak reliefto him that bears the strong offences crossah but those tears are pearl which thy love shedsand they are rich and ransom all ill deedsno more be grieved at that which thou hast doneroses have thorns and silver fountains mudclouds and eclipses stain both moon and sunand loathsome canker lives in sweetest budall men make faults and even I in thisauthorizing thy trespass with comparemyself corrupting salving thy amissexcusing thy sins more than thy sins arefor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--thy adverse party is thy advocate--and gainst myself a lawful plea commencesuch civil war is in my love and hatethat I an accessary needs must beto that sweet thief which sourly robs from melet me confess that we two must be twainalthough our undivided loves are oneso shall those blots that do with me remainwithout thy help by me be borne alonein our two loves there is but one respectthough in our lives a separable spitewhich though it alter not loves sole effectyet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delightI may not evermore acknowledge theelest my bewailed guilt should do thee shamenor thou with public kindness honour meunless thou take that honour from thy namebut do not so I love thee in such sortas thou being mine mine is thy good reportas a decrepit father takes delightto see his active child do deeds of youthso I made lame by fortunes dearest spitetake all my comfort of thy worth and truthfor whether beauty birth or wealth or witor any of these all or all or moreentitled in thy parts do crowned sitI make my love engrafted to this storeso then I am not lame poor nor despisedwhilst that this shadow doth such substance givethat I in thy abundance am sufficedand by a part of all thy glory livelook what is best that best I wish in theethis wish I have then ten times happy mehow can my muse want subject to inventwhile thou dost breathe that pourest into my versethine own sweet argument too excellentfor every vulgar paper to rehearseO give thy self the thanks if aught in meworthy perusal stand against thy sightfor whos so dumb that cannot write to theewhen thou thy self dost give invention lightbe thou the tenth muse ten times more in worththan those old nine which rhymers invocateand he that calls on thee let him bring fortheternal numbers to outlive long dateif my slight muse do please these curious daysthe pain be mine but thine shall be the praiseO how thy worth with manners may I singwhen thou art all the better part of mewhat can mine own praise to mine own self bringand what isit but mine own when I praise theeeven for this let us divided liveand our dear love lose name of single onethat by this separation I may givethat due to thee which thou deservest aloneO absence what a torment wouldst thou provewere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leaveto entertain the time with thoughts of lovewhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceiveand that thou teachest how to make one twainby praising him here who doth hence remaintake all my loves my love yea take them allwhat hast thou then more than thou hadst beforeno love my love that thou mayst true love callall mine was thine before thou hadst this morethen if for my love thou my love receivestI cannot blame thee for my love thou usestbut yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivestby wilful taste of what thyself refusestI do forgive thy robbery gentle thiefalthough thou steal thee all my povertyand yet love knows it is a greater griefto bear loves wrong than hates known injurylasvious grace in whom all ill well showskill me with spites yet we must not be foesthose pretty wrongs that liberty commitswhen I am sometime absent from thy heartthy beauty and thy years full well befitsfor still temptation follows where thou artgentle thou art and therefore to be wonbeauteous thou art therefore to be assailedand when a woman woos what womans sonwill sourly leave her till he have prevaileday me but yet thou mightst my seat forbearand chide thy beauty and thy straying youthwho lead thee in their riot even therewhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth--hers by thy beauty tempting her to theethine by thy beauty being false to methat thou hast her it is not all my griefand yet it may be said I loved her dearlythat she hath thee is of my wailing chiefa loss in love that touches me more nearlyloving offenders thus I will excuse yethou dost love her because thou knowest I love herand for my sake even so doth she abuse mesuffering my friend for my sake to approve herif I lose thee my loss is my loves gainand losing her my friend hath found that lossboth find each other and I lose both twainand both for my sake lay on me this crossbut heres the joy my friend and I are onesweet flattery then she loves but me alonewhen most I wink then do mine eyes best seefor all the day they view things unrespectedbut when I sleep in dreams they look on theeand darkly bright are bright in dark directedthen thou whose shadow shadows doth make brighthow would thy shadows form form happy showto the clear day with thy much clearer lightwhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines sohow would I say mine eyes be blessed madeby looking on thee in the living daywhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shadethrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stayall days are nights to see till I see theeand nights bright days when dreams do show thee meif the dull substance of my flesh were thoughtinjurious distance should not stop my wayfor then despite of space I would be broughtfrom limits far remote where thou dost stayno matter then although my foot did standupon the farthest earth removed from theefor nimble thought can jump both sea and landas soon as think the place where he would bebut ah thought kills me that I am not thoughtto leap large lengths of miles when thou art gonebut that so much of earth and water wroughtI must attend times leisure with my moanreceiving nought by elements so slowbut heavy tears badges of eithers woethe other two slight air and purging fireare both with thee wherever I abidethe first my thought the other my desirethese present-absent with swift motion slidefor when these quicker elements are gonein tender embassy of love to theemy life being made of four with two alonesinks down to death oppressed with melancholyuntil lifes composition be recuredby those swift messengers returned from theewho even but now come back again assuredof thy fair health recounting it to methis told I joy but then no longer gladI send them back again and straight grow sadmine eye and heart are at a mortal warhow to divide the conquest of thy sightmine eye my heart thy pictures sight would barmy heart mine eye the freedom of that rightmy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--a closet never pierced with crystal eyes--but the defendant doth that plea denyand says in him thy fair appearance liesto side this title is impannelleda quest of thoughts all tenants to the heartand by their verdict is determinedthe clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts partas thus mine eyes due is thy outward partand my hearts right thy inward love of heartbetwixt mine eye and heart a league is tookand each doth good turns now unto the otherwhen that mine eye is famished for a lookor heart in love with sighs himself doth smotherwith my loves picture then my eye doth feastand to the painted banquet bids my heartanother time mine eye is my hearts guestand in his thoughts of love doth share a partso either by thy picture or my lovethy self away art present still with mefor thou not farther than my thoughts canst moveand I am still with them and they with theeor if they sleep thy picture in my sightawakes my heart to hearts and eyes delighthow careful was I when I took my wayeach trifle under truest bars to thrustthat to my use it might unused stayfrom hands of falsehood in sure wards of trustbut thou to whom my jewels trifles aremost worthy comfort now my greatest griefthou best of dearest and mine only careart left the prey of every vulgar thiefthee have I not locked up in any chestsave where thou art not though I feel thou artwithin the gentle closure of my breastfrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and partand even thence thou wilt be stoln I fearfor truth proves thievish for a prize so dearagainst that time if ever that time comewhen I shall see thee frown on my defectswhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sumcalled to that audit by advised respectsagainst that time when thou shalt strangely passand scarcely greet me with that sun thine eyewhen love converted from the thing it wasshall reasons find of settled gravityagainst that time do I ensconce me herewithin the knowledge of mine own desertand this my hand against my self uprearto guard the lawful reasons on thy partto leave poor me thou hast the strength of lawssince why to love I can allege no causehow heavy do I journey on the waywhen what I seek my weary travels enddoth teach that ease and that repose to saythus far the miles are measured from thy friendthe beast that bears me tired with my woeplods dully on to bear that weight in meas if by some instinct the wretch did knowhis rider loved not speed being made from theethe bloody spur cannot provoke him onthat sometimes anger thrusts into his hidewhich heavily he answers with a groanmore sharp to me than spurring to his sidefor that same groan doth put this in my mindmy grief lies onward and my joy behindthus can my love excuse the slow offenceof my dull bearer when from thee I speedfrom where thou art why should I haste me thencetill I return of posting is no needO what excuse will my poor beast then findwhen swift extremity can seem but slowthen should I spur though mounted on the windin winged speed no motion shall I knowthen can no horse with my desire keep pacetherefore desire of perfectest love being madeshall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery racebut love for love thus shall excuse my jade--since from thee going he went wilful-slowtowards thee iull run and give him leave to goso am I as the rich whose blessed keycan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasurethe which he will not every hour surveyfor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasuretherefore are feasts so solemn and so raresince seldom coming in that long year setlike stones of worth they thinly placed areor captain jewels in the carcanetso is the time that keeps you as my chestor as the wardrobe which the robe doth hideto make some speal instant speal-blestby new unfolding his imprisoned prideblessed are you whose worthiness gives scopebeing had to triumph being lacked to hopewhat is your substance whereof are you madethat millions of strange shadows on you tendsince every one hath every one one shadeand you but one can every shadow lenddescribe Adonis and the counterfeitis poorly imitated after youon Helens cheek all art of beauty setand you in Grean tires are painted newspeak of the spring and foison of the yearthe one doth shadow of your beauty showthe other as your bounty doth appearand you in every blessed shape we knowin all external grace you have some partbut you like none none you for constant heartO how much more doth beauty beauteous seemby that sweet ornament which truth doth givethe rose looks fair but fairer we it deemfor that sweet odour which doth in it livethe canker blooms have full as deep a dyeas the perfumed tincture of the roseshang on such thorns and play as wantonlywhen summers breath their masked buds disclosesbut for their virtue only is their showthey live unwooed and unrespected fadedie to themselves sweet roses do not soof their sweet deaths are sweetest odours madeand so of you beauteous and lovely youthwhen that shall vade by verse distills your truthnot marble nor the gilded monumentsof princes shall outlive this powerful rhymebut you shall shine more bright in these contentsthan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish timewhen wasteful war shall statues overturnand broils root out the work of masonrynor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burnthe living record of your memorygainst death and all-oblivious enmityshall you pace forth your praise shall still find roomeven in the eyes of all posteritythat wear this world out to the ending doomso till the judgment that yourself ariseyou live in this and dwell in lovers eyessweet love renew thy force be it not saidthy edge should blunter be than appetitewhich but to-day by feeding is allayedto-morrow sharpened in his former mightso love be thou although to-day thou fillthy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulnessto-morrow see again and do not killthe spirit of love with a perpetual dulnesslet this sad interim like the ocean bewhich parts the shore where two contracted newcome daily to the banks that when they seereturn of love more blest may be the viewor call it winter which being full of caremakes summers welcome thrice more wished more rarebeing your slave what should I do but tendupon the hours and times of your desireI have no precious time at all to spendnor services to do till you requirenor dare I chide the world-without-end hourwhilst I my sovereign watch the clock for younor think the bitterness of absence sourwhen you have bid your servant once adieunor dare I question with my jealous thoughtwhere you may be or your affairs supposebut like a sad slave stay and think of noughtsave where you are how happy you make thoseso true a fool is love that in your willthough you do anything he thinks no illthat god forbid that made me first your slaveI should in thought control your times of pleasureor at your hand the account of hours to cravebeing your vassal bound to stay your leisureO let me suffer being at your beckthe imprisoned absence of your libertyand patience tame to sufferance bide each checkwithout accusing you of injurybe where you list your charter is so strongthat you yourself may privilage your timeto what you will to you it doth belongyourself to pardon of self-doing crimeI am to wait though waiting so be hellnot blame your pleasure be it ill or wellif there be nothing new but that which ishath been before how are our brains beguiledwhich labouring for invention bear amissthe second burthen of a former childO that record could with a backward lookeven of five hundred courses of the sunshow me your image in some antique booksince mind at first in character was donethat I might see what the old world could sayto this composed wonder of your framewhr we are mended or whr better theyor whether revolution be the sameO sure I am the wits of former daysto subjects worse have given admiring praiselike as the waves make towards the pebbled shoreso do our minutes hasten to their endeach changing place with that which goes beforein sequent toil all forwards do contendnativity once in the main of lightcrawls to maturity wherewith being crownedcrooked eclipses gainst his glory fightand Time that gave doth now his gift confoundtime doth transfix the flourish set on youthand delves the parallels in beautys browfeeds on the rarities of natures truthand nothing stands but for his scythe to mowand yet to times in hope my verse shall standpraising thy worth despite his cruel handis it thy will thy image should keep openmy heavy eyelids to the weary nightdost thou desire my slumbers should be brokenwhile shadows like to thee do mock my sightis it thy spirit that thou sendest from theeso far from home into my deeds to pryto find out shames and idle hours in methe scope and tenure of thy jealousyO no thy love though much is not so greatit is my love that keeps mine eye awakemine own true love that doth my rest defeatto play the watchman ever for thy sakefor thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewherefrom me far off with others all too nearsin of self-love possesseth all mine eyeand all my soul and all my every partand for this sin there is no remedyit is so grounded inward in my heartmethinks no face so gracious is as mineno shape so true no truth of such accountand for myself mine own worth do defineas I all other in all worths surmountbut when my glass shows me myself indeedbeated and chopped with tanned antiquitymine own self-love quite contrary I readself so self-loving were iniquityitis thee--myself--that for myself I praisepainting my age with beauty of thy daysagainst my love shall be as I am nowwith Times injurious hand crushed and oerwornwhen hours have drained his blood and filled his browwith lines and wrinkles when his youthful mornhath travelled on to ages steepy nightand all those beauties whereof now hes kingare vanishing or vanished out of sightstealing away the treasure of his springfor such a time do I now fortifyagainst confounding ages cruel knifethat he shall never cut from memorymy sweet loves beauty though my lovers lifehis beauty shall in these black lines be seenand they shall live and he in them still greenwhen I have seen by Times fell hand defacedthe rich-proud cost of outworn buried agewhen sometime lofty towers I see down-razedand brass eternal slave to mortal ragewhen I have seen the hungry ocean gainadvantage on the kingdom of the shoreand the firm soil win of the watery mainincreasing store with loss and loss with storewhen I have seen such interchange of stateor state itself confounded to decayruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--that Time will come and take my love awaythis thought is as a death which cannot choosebut weep to have that which it fears to losesince brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless seabut sad mortality oersways their powerhow with this rage shall beauty hold a pleawhose action is no stronger than a flowerO how shall summers honey breath hold outagainst the wrackful siege of battering dayswhen rocks impregnable are not so stoutnor gates of steel so strong but Time decaysO fearful meditation where alackshall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hidor what strong hand can hold his swift foot backor who his spoil of beauty can forbidO none unless this miracle have mightthat in black ink my love may still shine brighttired with all these for restful death I cryas to behold desert a beggar bornand needy nothing trimmed in jollityand purest faith unhappily forswornand gilded honour shamefully misplacedand maiden virtue rudely strumpetedand right perfection wrongfully disgracedand strength by limping sway disabledand art made tongue-tied by authorityand folly--doctor-like--controlling skilland simple truth miscalled simplityand captive good attending captain illtired with all these from these would I be gonesave that to die I leave my love aloneah wherefore with infection should he liveand with his presence grace impietythat sin by him advantage should achieveand lace itself with his societywhy should false painting imitate his cheekand steel dead seeming of his living huewhy should poor beauty indirectly seekroses of shadow since his rose is truewhy should he live now nature bankrupt isbeggared of blood to blush through lively veinsfor she hath no exchequer now but hisand proud of many lives upon his gainsO him she stores to show what wealth she hadin days long since before these last so badthus is his cheek the map of days outwornwhen beauty lived and died as flowers do nowbefore these bastard signs of fair were bornor durst inhabit on a living browbefore the golden tresses of the deadthe right of sepulchres were shorn awayto live a second life on second headere beautys dead fleece made another gayin him those holy antique hours are seenwithout all ornament itself and truemaking no summer of anothers greenrobbing no old to dress his beauty newand him as for a map doth nature storeto show false art what beauty was of yorethose parts of thee that the worlds eye doth viewwant nothing that the thought of hearts can mendall tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that dueuttering bare truth even so as foes commendthy outward thus with outward praise is crownedbut those same tongues that give thee so thine ownin other accents do this praise confoundby seeing farther than the eye hath shownthey look into the beauty of thy mindand that in guess they measure by thy deedsthen--churls--their thoughts although their eyes were kindto thy fair flower add the rank smell of weedsbut why thy odour matcheth not thy showthe soil is this that thou dost common growthat thou art blamed shall not be thy defectfor slanders mark was ever yet the fairthe ornament of beauty is suspecta crow that flies in heavens sweetest airso thou be good slander doth but approvethy worth the greater being wooed of timefor canker vice the sweetest buds doth loveand thou presentest a pure unstained primethou hast passed by the ambush of young dayseither not assailed or victor being chargedyet this thy praise cannot be so thy praiseto tie up envy evermore enlargedif some suspect of ill masked not thy showthen thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst oweno longer mourn for me when I am deadthan you shall hear the surly sullen bellgive warning to the world that I am fledfrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwellnay if you read this line remember notthe hand that writ it for I love you sothat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgotif thinking on me then should make you woeO if--I say you look upon this versewhen I perhaps compounded am with claydo not so much as my poor name rehearsebut let your love even with my life decaylest the wise world should look into your moanand mock you with me after I am goneO lest the world should task you to retewhat merit lived in me that you should loveafter my death--dear love forget me quitefor you in me can nothing worthy proveunless you would devise some virtuous lieto do more for me than mine own desertand hang more praise upon deceased Ithan niggard truth would willingly impartO lest your true love may seem false in thisthat you for love speak well of me untruemy name be buried where my body isand live no more to shame nor me nor youfor I am shamed by that which I bring forthand so should you to love things nothing worththat time of year thou mayst in me beholdwhen yellow leaves or none or few do hangupon those boughs which shake against the coldbare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sangin me thou seeist the twilight of such dayas after sunset fadeth in the westwhich by and by black night doth take awaydeaths second self that seals up all in restin me thou seeist the glowing of such firethat on the ashes of his youth doth lieas the death-bed whereon it must expireconsumed with that which it was nourished bythis thou perceivest which makes thy love more strongto love that well which thou must leave ere longbut be contented when that fell arrestwithout all bail shall carry me awaymy life hath in this line some interestwhich for memorial still with thee shall staywhen thou reviewest this thou dost reviewthe very part was consecrate to theethe earth can have but earth which is his duemy spirit is thine the better part of meso then thou hast but lost the dregs of lifethe prey of worms my body being deadthe coward conquest of a wretchs knifetoo base of thee to be rememberedthe worth of that is that which it containsand that is this and this with thee remainsso are you to my thoughts as food to lifeor as sweet-seasoned showers are to the groundand for the peace of you I hold such strifeas btwixt a miser and his wealth is foundnow proud as an enjoyer and anondoubting the filching age will steal his treasurenow counting best to be with you alonethen bettered that the world may see my pleasuresometime all full with feasting on your sightand by and by clean starved for a lookpossessing or pursuing no delightsave what is had or must from you be tookthus do I pine and surfeit day by dayor gluttoning on all or all awaywhy is my verse so barren of new prideso far from variation or quick changewhy with the time do I not glance asideto new-found methods and to compounds strangewhy write I still all one ever the sameand keep invention in a noted weedthat every word doth almost tell my nameshowing their birth and where they did proceedO know sweet love I always write of youand you and love are still my argumentso all my best is dressing old words newspending again what is already spentfor as the sun is daily new and oldso is my love still telling what is toldthy glass will show thee how thy beauties wearthy dial how thy precious minutes wastethese vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bearand of this book this learning mayst thou tastethe wrinkles which thy glass will truly showof mouthed graves will give thee memorythou by thy dials shady stealth mayst knowtimes thievish progress to eternitylook what thy memory cannot containcommit to these waste blanks and thou shalt findthose children nursed delivered from thy brainto take a new acquaintance of thy mindthese offices so oft as thou wilt lookshall profit thee and much enrich thy bookso oft have I invoked thee for my museand found such fair assistance in my verseas every alien pen hath got my useand under thee their poesy dispersethine eyes that taught the dumb on high to singand heavy ignorance aloft to flyhave added feathers to the learneds wingand given grace a double majestyyet be most proud of that which I compilewhose influence is thine and born of theein others works thou dost but mend the styleand arts with thy sweet graces graced bebut thou art all my art and dost advanceas high as learning my rude ignorancewhilst I alone did call upon thy aidmy verse alone had all thy gentle gracebut now my gracious numbers are decayedand my sick muse doth give an other placeI grant sweet love thy lovely argumentdeserves the travail of a worthier penyet what of thee thy poet doth inventhe robs thee of and pays it thee againhe lends thee virtue and he stole that wordfrom thy behaviour beauty doth he giveand found it in thy cheek he can affordno praise to thee but what in thee doth livethen thank him not for that which he doth saysince what he owes thee thou thyself dost payO how I faint when I of you do writeknowing a better spirit doth use your nameand in the praise thereof spends all his mightto make me tongue-tied speaking of your famebut since your worth--wide as the ocean is--the humble as the proudest sail doth bearmy saucy bark inferior far to hison your broad main doth wilfully appearyour shallowest help will hold me up afloatwhilst he upon your soundless deep doth rideor being wracked I am a worthless boathe of tall building and of goodly pridethen if he thrive and I be cast awaythe worst was this--my love was my decayor I shall live your epitaph to makeor you survive when I in earth am rottenfrom hence your memory death cannot takealthough in me each part will be forgottenyour name from hence immortal life shall havethough I once gone to all the world must diethe earth can yield me but a common gravewhen you entombed in mens eyes shall lieyour monument shall be my gentle versewhich eyes not yet created shall oer-readand tongues to be your being shall rehearsewhen all the breathers of this world are deadyou still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--where breath most breathes even in the mouths of menI grant thou wert not married to my museand therefore mayst without attaint oerlookthe dedicated words which writers useof their fair subject blessing every bookthou art as fair in knowledge as in huefinding thy worth a limit past my praiseand therefore art enforced to seek anewsome fresher stamp of the time-bettering daysand do so love yet when they have devisedwhat strained touches rhetoric can lendthou truly fair wert truly sympathizedin true plain words by thy true-telling friendand their gross painting might be better usedwhere cheeks need blood in thee it is abusedI never saw that you did painting needand therefore to your fair no painting setI found or thought I found you did exceedthat barren tender of a poets debtand therefore have I slept in your reportthat you yourself being extant well might showhow far a modern quill doth come too shortspeaking of worth what worth in you doth growthis silence for my sin you did imputewhich shall be most my glory being dumbfor I impair not beauty being mutewhen others would give life and bring a tombthere lives more life in one of your fair eyesthan both your poets can in praise devisewho is it that says most which can say morethan this rich praise--that you alone are youin whose confine immured is the storewhich should example where your equal grewlean penury within that pen doth dwellthat to his subject lends not some small glorybut he that writes of you if he can tellthat you are you so dignifies his storylet him but copy what in you is writnot making worse what nature made so clearand such a counterpart shall fame his witmaking his style admired every whereyou to your beauteous blessings add a cursebeing fond on praise which makes your praises worsemy tongue-tied muse in manners holds her stillwhile comments of your praise richly compiledreserve their character with golden quilland precious phrase by all the muses filedI think good thoughts whilst others write good wordsand like unlettered clerk still cry amento every hymn that able spirit affordsin polished form of well-refined penhearing you praised I say itis so itis trueand to the most of praise add something morebut that is in my thought whose love to youthough words come hindmost holds his rank beforethen others for the breath of words respectme for my dumb thoughts speaking in effectwas it the proud full sail of his great versebound for the prize of all too precious youthat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearsemaking their tomb the womb wherein they grewwas it his spirit by spirits taught to writeabove a mortal pitch that struck me deadno neither he nor his compeers by nightgiving him aid my verse astonishedhe nor that affable familiar ghostwhich nightly gulls him with intelligenceas victors of my silence cannot boastI was not sick of any fear from thencebut when your countenance filled up his linethen lacked I matter that enfeebled minefarewell thou art too dear for my possessingand like enough thou knowest thy estimatethe charter of thy worth gives thee releasingmy bonds in thee are all determinatefor how do I hold thee but by thy grantingand for that riches where is my deservingthe cause of this fair gift in me is wantingand so my patent back again is swervingthy self thou gavest thy own worth then not knowingor me to whom thou gavest it else mistakingso thy great gift upon misprision growingcomes home again on better judgement makingthus have I had thee as a dream doth flatterin sleep a king but waking no such matterwhen thou shalt be disposed to set me lightand place my merit in the eye of scornupon thy side against myself iull fightand prove thee virtuous though thou art forswornwith mine own weakness being best acquaintedupon thy part I can set down a storyof faults concealed wherein I am attaintedthat thou in losing me shalt win much gloryand I by this will be a gainer toofor bending all my loving thoughts on theethe injuries that to myself I dodoing thee vantage double-vantage mesuch is my love to thee I so belongthat for thy right myself will bear all wrongsay that thou didst forsake me for some faultand I will comment upon that offencespeak of my lameness and I straight will haltagainst thy reasons making no defencethou canst not love disgrace me half so illto set a form upon desired changeas iull myself disgrace knowing thy willI will acquaintance strangle and look strangebe absent from thy walks and in my tonguethy sweet beloved name no more shall dwelllest I too much profane should do it wrongand haply of our old acquaintance tellfor thee against my self iull vow debatefor I must neer love him whom thou dost hatethen hate me when thou wilt if ever nownow while the world is bent my deeds to crossjoin with the spite of fortune make me bowand do not drop in for an after-lossah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrowcome in the rearward of a conquered woegive not a windy night a rainy morrowto linger out a purposed overthrowif thou wilt leave me do not leave me lastwhen other petty griefs have done their spitebut in the onset come so shall I tasteat first the very worst of fortunes mightand other strains of woe which now seem woecompared with loss of thee will not seem sosome glory in their birth some in their skillsome in their wealth some in their bodys forcesome in their garments though new-fangled illsome in their hawks and hounds some in their horseand every humour hath his adjunct pleasurewherein it finds a joy above the restbut these particulars are not my measureall these I better in one general bestthy love is better than high birth to mericher than wealth prouder than garments costsof more delight than hawks and horses beand having thee of all mens pride I boastwretched in this alone that thou mayst takeall this away and me most wretchcd makebut do thy worst to steal thyself awayfor term of life thou art assured mineand life no longer than thy love will stayfor it depends upon that love of thinethen need I not to fear the worst of wrongswhen in the least of them my life hath endI see a better state to me belongsthan that which on thy humour doth dependthou canst not vex me with inconstant mindsince that my life on thy revolt doth lieO what a happy title do I findhappy to have thy love happy to diebut whats so blessed-fair that fears no blotthou mayst be false and yet I know it notso shall I live supposing thou art truelike a deceived husband so loves facemay still seem love to me though altered newthy looks with me thy heart in other placefor there can live no hatred in thine eyetherefore in that I cannot know thy changein manys looks the false hearts historyis writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strangebut heaven in thy creation did decreethat in thy face sweet love should ever dwellwhateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings bethy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tellhow like Eves apple doth thy beauty growif thy sweet virtue answer not thy showthey that have power to hurt and will do nonethat do not do the thing they most do showwho moving others are themselves as stoneunmoved cold and to temptation slowthey rightly do inherit heavens gracesand husband natures riches from expensethey are the lords and owners of their facesothers but stewards of their excellencethe summers flower is to the summer sweetthough to itself it only live and diebut if that flower with base infection meetthe basest weed outbraves his dignityfor sweetest things turn sourest by their deedslilies that fester smell far worse than weedshow sweet and lovely dost thou make the shamewhich like a canker in the fragrant rosedoth spot the beauty of thy budding nameO in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclosethat tongue that tells the story of thy daysmaking lasvious comments on thy sportcannot dispraise but in a kind of praisenaming thy name blesses an ill reportO what a mansion have those vices gotwhich for their habitation chose out theewhere beautys veil doth cover every blotand all things turns to fair that eyes can seetake heed dear heart of this large privilegethe hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edgesome say thy fault is youth some wantonnesssome say thy grace is youth and gentle sportboth grace and faults are loved of more and lessthou makest faults graces that to thee resortas on the finger of a throned queenthe basest jewel will be well esteemedso are those errors that in thee are seento truths translated and for true things deemedhow many lambs might the stern wolf betrayif like a lamb he could his looks translatehow many gazers mightst thou lead awayif thou wouldst use the strength of all thy statebut do not so I love thee in such sortas thou being mine mine is thy good reporthow like a winter hath my absence beenfrom thee the pleasure of the fleeting yearwhat freezings have I felt what dark days seenwhat old Decembers bareness everywhereand yet this time removed was summers timethe teeming autumn big with rich increasebearing the wanton burden of the primelike widowed wombs after their lords deceaseyet this abundant issue seemed to mebut hope of orphans and unfathered fruitfor summer and his pleasures wait on theeand thou away the very birds are muteor if they sing itis with so dull a cheerthat leaves look pale dreading the winters nearfrom you have I been absent in the springwhen proud-pied April dressed in all his trimhath put a spirit of youth in every thingthat heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with himyet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smellof different flowers in odour and in huecould make me any summers story tellor from their proud lap pluck them where they grewnor did I wonder at the lilys whitenor praise the deep vermilion in the rosethey were but sweet but figures of delightdrawn after you you pattern of all thoseyet seemed it winter still and you awayas with your shadow I with these did playthe forward violet thus did I chidesweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smellsif not from my loves breath the purple pridewhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwellsin my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyedthe lily I condemned for thy handand buds of marjoram had stoln thy hairthe roses fearfully on thorns did standone blushing shame another white despaira third nor red nor white had stoln of bothand to his robbery had annexed thy breathbut for his theft in pride of all his growtha vengeful canker eat him up to deathmore flowers I noted yet I none could seebut sweet or colour it had stoln from theewhere art thou muse that thou forgetest so longto speak of that which gives thee all thy mightspendest thou thy fury on some worthless songdarkening thy power to lend base subjects lightreturn forgetful muse and straight redeemin gentle numbers time so idly spentsing to the ear that doth thy lays esteemand gives thy pen both skill and argumentrise resty muse my loves sweet face surveyif Time have any wrinkle graven thereif any be a satire to decayand make times spoils despised every wheregive my love fame faster than Time wastes lifeso thou preventest his scythe and crooked knifeO truant muse what shall be thy amendsfor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyedboth truth and beauty on my love dependsso dost thou too and therein dignifiedmake answer muse wilt thou not haply saytruth needs no colour with his colour fixedbeauty no penl beautys truth to laybut best is best if never intermixedbecause he needs no praise wilt thou be dumbexcuse not silence so forit lies in theeto make him much outlive a gilded tomband to be praised of ages yet to bethen do thy office muse I teach thee howto make him seem long hence as he shows nowmy love is strengthened though more weak in seemingI love not less though less the show appearthat love is merchandized whose rich esteemingthe owners tongue doth publish every whereour love was new and then but in the springwhen I was wont to greet it with my laysas Philomel in summers front doth singand stops her pipe in growth of riper daysnot that the summer is less pleasant nowthan when her mournful hymns did hush the nightbut that wild music burthens every boughand sweets grown common lose their dear delighttherefore like her I sometime hold my tonguebecause I would not dull you with my songalack what poverty my muse brings forththat having such a scope to show her pridethe argument all bare is of more worththan when it hath my added praise besideO blame me not if I no more can writelook in your glass and there appears a facethat over-goes my blunt invention quitedulling my lines and doing me disgracewere it not sinful then striving to mendto mar the subject that before was wellfor to no other pass my verses tendthan of your graces and your gifts to telland more much more than in my verse can sityour own glass shows you when you look in itto me fair friend you never can be oldfor as you were when first your eye I eyedsuch seems your beauty still Three winters coldhave from the forests shook three summers pridethree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnedin process of the seasons have I seenthree April perfumes in three hot Junes burnedsince first I saw you fresh which yet are greenah yet doth beauty like a dial-handsteal from his figure and no pace perceivedso your sweet hue which methinks still doth standhath motion and mine eye may be deceivedfor fear of which hear this thou age unbredere you were born was beautys summer deadlet not my love be called idolatrynor my beloved as an idol showsince all alike my songs and praises beto one of one still such and ever sokind is my love to-day to-morrow kindstill constant in a wondrous excellencetherefore my verse to constancy confinedone thing expressing leaves out differencefair kind and true is all my argumentfair kind and true varying to other wordsand in this change is my invention spentthree themes in one which wondrous scope affordsfair kind and true have often lived alonewhich three till now never kept seat in onewhen in the chronicle of wasted timeI see descriptions of the fairest wightsand beauty making beautiful old rimein praise of ladies dead and lovely knightsthen in the blazon of sweet beautys bestof hand of foot of lip of eye of browI see their antique pen would have expressedeven such a beauty as you master nowso all their praises are but propheesof this our time all you prefiguringand for they looked but with divining eyesthey had not skill enough your worth to singfor we which now behold these present dayshave eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praisenot mine own fears nor the prophetic soulof the wide world dreaming on things to comecan yet the lease of my true love controlsupposed as forfeit to a confined doomthe mortal moon hath her eclipse enduredand the sad augurs mock their own presageincertainties now crown themselves assuredand peace proclaims olives of endless agenow with the drops of this most balmy timemy love looks fresh and death to me subscribessince spite of him iull live in this poor rimewhile he insults oer dull and speechless tribesand thou in this shalt find thy monumentwhen tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spentwhats in the brain that ink may characterwhich hath not figured to thee my true spiritwhats new to speak what now to registerthat may express my love or thy dear meritnothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divineI must each day say oer the very samecounting no old thing old thou mine I thineeven as when first I hallowed thy fair nameso that eternal love in loves fresh caseweighs not the dust and injury of agenor gives to necessary wrinkles placebut makes antiquity for aye his pagefinding the first conceit of love there bredwhere time and outward form would show it deadO never say that I was false of heartthough absence seemed my flame to qualifyas easy might I from my self departas from my soul which in thy breast doth liethat is my home of love if I have rangedlike him that travels I return againjust to the time not with the time exchangedso that myself bring water for my stainnever believe though in my nature reignedall frailties that besiege all kinds of bloodthat it could so preposterously be stainedto leave for nothing all thy sum of goodfor nothing this wide universe I callsave thou my rose in it thou art my allalas itis true I have gone here and thereand made my self a motley to the viewgored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dearmade old offences of affections newmost true it is that I have looked on truthaskance and strangely but by all abovethese blenches gave my heart another youthand worse essays proved thee my best of lovenow all is done save what shall have no endmine appetite I never more will grindon newer proof to try an older frienda god in love to whom I am confinedthen give me welcome next my heaven the besteven to thy pure and most most loving breastO for my sake do you with fortune chidethe guilty goddess of my harmful deedsthat did not better for my life providethan public means which public manners breedsthence comes it that my name receives a brandand almost thence my nature is subduedto what it works in like the dyers handpity me then and wish I were renewedwhilst like a willing patient I will drinkpotions of eisel gainst my strong infectionno bitterness that I will bitter thinknor double penance to correct correctionpity me then dear friend and I assure yeeven that your pity is enough to cure meyour love and pity doth the impression fillwhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my browfor what care I who calls me well or illso you oer-green my bad my good allowyou are my all-the-world and I must striveto know my shames and praises from your tonguenone else to me nor I to none alivethat my steeled sense or changes right or wrongin so profound abysm I throw all careof others voices that my adders senseto critic and to flatterer stopped aremark how with my neglect I do dispenseyou are so strongly in my purpose bredthat all the world besides methinks are deadsince I left you mine eye is in my mindand that which governs me to go aboutdoth part his function and is partly blindseems seeing but effectually is outfor it no form delivers to the heartof bird of flower or shape which it doth latchof his quick objects hath the mind no partnor his own vision holds what it doth catchfor if it see the rudest or gentlest sightthe most sweet favour or deformedest creaturethe mountain or the sea the day or nightthe crow or dove it shapes them to your featureincapable of more replete with youmy most true mind thus maketh mine untrueor whether doth my mind being crowned with youdrink up the monarchs plague this flatteryor whether shall I say mine eye saith trueand that your love taught it this alchemyto make of monsters and things indigestsuch cherubins as your sweet self resemblecreating every bad a perfect bestas fast as objects to his beams assembleO itis the first itis flattery in my seeingand my great mind most kingly drinks it upmine eye well knows what with his gust is greeingand to his palate doth prepare the cupif it be poisoned itis the lesser sinthat mine eye loves it and doth first beginthose lines that I before have writ do lieeven those that said I could not love you deareryet then my judgment knew no reason whymy most full flame should afterwards burn clearerbut reckoning Time whose millioned acdentscreep in btwixt vows and change decrees of kingstan sacred beauty blunt the sharpest intentsdivert strong minds to the course of altering thingsalas why fearing of Times tyrannymight I not then say now I love you bestwhen I was certain oer incertaintycrowning the present doubting of the restlove is a babe then might I not say soto give full growth to that which still doth growlet me not to the marriage of true mindsadmit impediments love is not lovewhich alters when it alteration findsor bends with the remover to removeO no it is an ever-fixed markthat looks on tempests and is never shakenit is the star to every wandering barkwhose worths unknown although his height be takenloves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheekswithin his bending sickles compass comelove alters not with his brief hours and weeksbut bears it out even to the edge of doomif this be error and upon me provedI never writ nor no man ever lovedaccuse me thus that I have scanted allwherein I should your great deserts repayforgot upon your dearest love to callwhereto all bonds do tie me day by daythat I have frequent been with unknown mindsand given to time your own dear-purchased rightthat I have hoisted sail to all the windswhich should transport me farthest from your sightbook both my wilfulness and errors downand on just proof surmise accumulatebring me within the level of your frownbut shoot not at me in your wakened hatesince my appeal says I did strive to provethe constancy and virtue of your lovelike as to make our appetite more keenwith eager compounds we our palate urgeas to prevent our maladies unseenwe sicken to shun sickness when we purgeeven so being full of your neer-cloying sweetnessto bitter sauces did I frame my feedingand sick of welfare found a kind of meetnessto be diseased ere that there was true needingthus policy in love to antipatethe ills that were not grew to faults assuredand brought to medine a healthful statewhich rank of goodness would by ill be curedbut thence I learn and find the lesson truedrugs poison him that so fell sick of youwhat potions have I drunk of siren tearsdistilled from limbecks foul as hell withinapplying fears to hopes and hopes to fearsstill losing when I saw myself to winwhat wretched errors hath my heart committedwhilst it hath thought itself so blessed neverhow have mine eyes out of their spheres been fittedin the distraction of this madding feverO benefit of ill now I find truethat better is by evil still made betterand ruined love when it is built anewgrows fairer than at first more strong far greaterso I return rebuked to my contentand gain by ill thrice more than I have spentthat you were once unkind befriends me nowand for that sorrow which I then did feelneeds must I under my transgression bowunless my nerves were brass or hammered steelfor if you were by my unkindness shakenas I by yours youve passed a hell of timeand I a tyrant have no leisure takento weigh how once I suffered in your crimeO that our night of woe might have rememberedmy deepest sense how hard true sorrow hitsand soon to you as you to me then tenderedthe humble salve which wounded bosoms fitsbut that your trespass now becomes a feemine ransoms yours and yours must ransom meitis better to be vile than vile esteemedwhen not to be receives reproach of beingand the just pleasure lost which is so deemednot by our feeling but by others seeingfor why should others false adulterate eyesgive salutation to my sportive bloodor on my frailties why are frailer spieswhich in their wills count bad what I think goodno I am that I am and they that levelat my abuses reckon up their ownI may be straight though they themselves be bevelby their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shownunless this general evil they maintainall men are bad and in their badness reignthy gift thy tables are within my brainfull charactered with lasting memorywhich shall above that idle rank remainbeyond all date even to eternityor at the least so long as brain and hearthave faculty by nature to subsisttill each to razed oblivion yield his partof thee thy record never can be missedthat poor retention could not so much holdnor need I tallies thy dear love to scoretherefore to give them from me was I boldto trust those tables that receive thee moreto keep an adjunct to remember theewere to import forgetfulness in meno Time thou shalt not boast that I do changethy pyramids built up with newer mightto me are nothing novel nothing strangethey are but dressings of a former sightour dates are brief and therefore we admirewhat thou dost foist upon us that is oldand rather make them born to our desirethan think that we before have heard them toldthy registers and thee I both defynot wondering at the present nor the pastfor thy records and what we see doth liemade more or less by thy continual hastethis I do vow and this shall ever beaI will be true despite thy scythe and theeif my dear love were but the child of stateit might for fortunes bastard be unfatheredas subject to Times love or to Times hateweeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatheredno it was builded far from acdentit suffers not in smiling pomp nor fallsunder the blow of thralled discontentwhereto th inviting time our fashion callsit fears not policy that hereticwhich works on leases of short-numbered hoursbut all alone stands hugely politicthat it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showersto this I witness call the fools of timewhich die for goodness who have lived for crimewereit aught to me I bore the canopywith my extern the outward honouringor laid great bases for eternitywhich proves more short than waste or ruininghave I not seen dwellers on form and favourlose all and more by paying too much rentfor compound sweet forgoing simple savourpitiful thrivers in their gazing spentno let me be obsequious in thy heartand take thou my oblation poor but freewhich is not mixed with seconds knows no artbut mutual render only me for theehence thou suborned informer a true soulwhen most impeached stands least in thy controlO thou my lovely boy who in thy powerdost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hourwho hast by waning grown and therein showestthy lovers withering as thy sweet self growestif nature sovereign mistress over wrackas thou goest onwards still will pluck thee backshe keeps thee to this purpose that her skillmay time disgrace and wretched minutes killyet fear her O thou minion of her pleasureshe may detain but not still keep her treasureher audit (though delayed) answered must beand her quietus is to render theein the old age black was not counted fairor if it were it bore not beautys namebut now is black beautys successive heirand beauty slandered with a bastard shamefor since each hand hath put on natures powerfairing the foul with arts false borrowed facesweet beauty hath no name no holy bowerbut is profaned if not lives in disgracetherefore my mistress eyes are raven blackher eyes so suited and they mourners seemat such who not born fair no beauty lackslandring creation with a false esteemyet so they mourn becoming of their woethat every tongue says beauty should look sohow oft when thou my music music playestupon that blessed wood whose motion soundswith thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayestthe wiry concord that mine ear confoundsdo I envy those jacks that nimble leapto kiss the tender inward of thy handwhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reapat the woods boldness by thee blushing standto be so tickled they would change their stateand situation with those danng chipsoer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gaitmaking dead wood more blessed than living lipssince saucy jacks so happy are in thisgive them thy fingers me thy lips to kissthe expense of spirit in a waste of shameis lust in action and till action lustis perjured murderous bloody full of blamesavage extreme rude cruel not to trustenjoyed no sooner but despised straightpast reason hunted and no sooner hadpast reason hated as a swallowed baiton purpose laid to make the taker madmad in pursuit and in possession sohad having and in quest to have extremea bliss in proof and proved a very woebefore a joy proposed behind a dreamall this the world well knows yet none knows wellto shun the heaven that leads men to this hellmy mistress eyes are nothing like the suncoral is far more red than her lips redif snow be white why then her breasts are dunif hairs be wires black wires grow on her headI have seen roses damasked red and whitebut no such roses see I in her cheeksand in some perfumes is there more delightthan in the breath that from my mistress reeksI love to hear her speak yet well I knowthat music hath a far more pleasing soundI grant I never saw a goddess gomy mistress when she walks treads on the groundand yet by heaven I think my love as rareas any she belied with false comparethou art as tyrannous so as thou artas those whose beauties proudly make them cruelfor well thou knowest to my dear doting heartthou art the fairest and most precious jewelyet in good faith some say that thee beholdthy face hath not the power to make love groanto say they err I dare not be so boldalthough I swear it to myself aloneand to be sure that is not false I sweara thousand groans but thinking on thy faceone on anothers neck do witness bearthy black is fairest in my judgments placein nothing art thou black save in thy deedsand thence this slander as I think proceedsthine eyes I love and they as pitying meknowing thy heart torment me with disdainhave put on black and loving mourners belooking with pretty ruth upon my painand truly not the morning sun of heavenbetter becomes the grey cheeks of the eastnor that full star that ushers in the evendoth half that glory to the sober westas those two mourning eyes become thy faceO let it then as well beseem thy heartto mourn for me since mourning doth thee graceand suit thy pity like in every partthen will I swear beauty herself is blackand all they foul that thy complexion lackbeshrew that heart that makes my heart to groanfor that deep wound it gives my friend and meisit not enough to torture me alonebut slave to slavery my sweetest friend must beme from myself thy cruel eye hath takenand my next self thou harder hast engrossedof him myself and thee I am forsakena torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossedprison my heart in thy steel bosoms wardbut then my friends heart let my poor heart bailwhoeer keeps me let my heart be his guardthou canst not then use rigour in my jailand yet thou wilt for I being pent in theeperforce am thine and all that is in meso now I have confessed that he is thineand I my self am mortgaged to thy willmyself iull forfeit so that other minethou wilt restore to be my comfort stillbut thou wilt not nor he will not be freefor thou art covetous and he is kindhe learned but surety-like to write for meunder that bond that him as fast doth bindthe statute of thy beauty thou wilt takethou usurer that puttest forth all to useand sue a friend came debtor for my sakeso him I lose through my unkind abusehim have I lost thou hast both him and mehe pays the whole and yet am I not freewhoever hath her wish thou hast thy Willand willito boot and Will in over-plusmore than enough am I that vexed thee stillto thy sweet will making addition thuswilt thou whose will is large and spaousnot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thineshall will in others seem right graciousand in my will no fair acceptance shinethe sea all water yet receives rain stilland in abundance addeth to his storeso thou being rich in Will add to thy Willone will of mine to make thy large will morelet no unkind no fair beseechers killthink all but one and me in that one Willif thy soul check thee that I come so nearswear to thy blind soul that I was thy Willand will thy soul knows is admitted therethus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfilwill will fulfil the treasure of thy loveay fill it full with wills and my will onein things of great receipt with ease we proveamong a number one is reckoned nonethen in the number let me pass untoldthough in thy stores account I one must befor nothing hold me so it please thee holdthat nothing me a something sweet to theemake but my name thy love and love that stilland then thou lovest me for my name is Willthou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyesthat they behold and see not what they seethey know what beauty is see where it liesyet what the best is take the worst to beif eyes corrupt by over-partial looksbe anchored in the bay where all men ridewhy of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hookswhereto the judgment of my heart is tiedwhy should my heart think that a several plotwhich my heart knows the wide worlds common placeor mine eyes seeing this say this is notto put fair truth upon so foul a facein things right true my heart and eyes have erredand to this false plague are they now transferredwhen my love swears that she is made of truthI do believe her though I know she liesthat she might think me some untutored youthunlearned in the worlds false subtletiesthus vainly thinking that she thinks me youngalthough she knows my days are past the bestsimply I credit her false-speaking tongueon both sides thus is simple truth suppressedbut wherefore says she not she is unjustand wherefore say not I that I am oldO loves best habit is in seeming trustand age in love loves not to have years toldtherefore I lie with her and she with meand in our faults by lies we flattered beO call not me to justify the wrongthat thy unkindness lays upon my heartwound me not with thine eye but with thy tongueuse power with power and slay me not by arttell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sightdear heart forbear to glance thine eye asidewhat needest thou wound with cunning when thy mightis more than my oerpressed defence can bidelet me excuse thee ah my love well knowsher pretty looks have been mine enemiesand therefore from my face she turns my foesthat they elsewhere might dart their injuriesyet do not so but since I am near slainkill me outright with looks and rid my painbe wise as thou art cruel do not pressmy tongue-tied patience with too much disdainlest sorrow lend me words and words expressthe manner of my pity-wanting painif I might teach thee wit better it werethough not to love yet love to tell me so--as testy sick men when their deaths be nearno news but health from their physians know--for if I should despair I should grow madand in my madness might speak ill of theenow this ill-wresting world is grown so badmad slanderers by mad ears believed bethat I may not be so nor thou beliedbear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go widein faith I do not love thee with mine eyesfor they in thee a thousand errors notebut itis my heart that loves what they despisewho in despite of view is pleased to dotenor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delightednor tender feeling to base touches pronenor taste nor smell desire to be invitedto any sensual feast with thee alonebut my five wits nor my five senses candissuade one foolish heart from serving theewho leaves unswayed the likeness of a manthy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to beonly my plague thus far I count my gainthat she that makes me sin awards me painlove is my sin and thy dear virtue hatehate of my sin grounded on sinful lovingO but with mine compare thou thine own stateand thou shalt find it merits not reprovingor if it do not from those lips of thinethat have profaned their scarlet ornamentsand sealed false bonds of love as oft as minerobbed others beds revenues of their rentsbe it lawful I love thee as thou lovest thosewhom thine eyes woo as mine importune theeroot pity in thy heart that when it growsthy pity may deserve to pitied beif thou dost seek to have what thou dost hideby self-example mayst thou be deniedlo as a careful housewife runs to catchone of her feathered creatures broke awaysets down her babe and makes all swift dispatchin pursuit of the thing she would have staywhilst her neglected child holds her in chasecries to catch her whose busy care is bentto follow that which flies before her facenot prizing her poor infants discontentso runnest thou after that which flies from theewhilst I thy babe chase thee afar behindbut if thou catch thy hope turn back to meand play the mothers part kiss me be kindso will I pray that thou mayst have thy Willif thou turn back and my loud crying stilltwo loves I have of comfort and despairwhich like two spirits do suggest me stillthe better angel is a man right fairthe worser spirit a woman coloured illto win me soon to hell my female eviltempteth my better angel from my sideand would corrupt my saint to be a devilwooing his purity with her foul prideand whether that my angel be turned fiendsuspect I may yet not directly tellbut being both from me both to each friendI guess one angel in anothers hellyet this shall I neer know but live in doubttill my bad angel fire my good one outthose lips that loves own hand did makebreathed forth the sound that said I hateto me that languished for her sakebut when she saw my woeful statestraight in her heart did mercy comechiding that tongue that ever sweetwas used in giving gentle doomand taught it thus anew to greetI hate she altered with an endthat followed it as gentle daydoth follow night who like a fiendfrom heaven to hell is flown awayI hate from hate away she threwand saved my life saying not youpoor soul the centre of my sinful earthmy sinful earth these rebel powers arraywhy dost thou pine within and suffer dearthpainting thy outward walls so costly gaywhy so large cost having so short a leasedost thou upon thy fading mansion spendshall worms inheritors of this excesseat up thy charge is this thy bodys endthen soul live thou upon thy servants lossand let that pine to aggravate thy storebuy terms divine in selling hours of drosswithin be fed without be rich no moreso shall thou feed on death that feeds on menand death once dead theres no more dying thenmy love is as a fever longing stillfor that which longer nurseth the diseasefeeding on that which doth preserve the illthe uncertain sickly appetite to pleasemy reason the physian to my loveangry that his prescriptions are not kepthath left me and I desperate now approvedesire is death which physic did exceptpast cure I am now reason is past careand frantic-mad with evermore unrestmy thoughts and my discourse as madmens areat random from the truth vainly expressedfor I have sworn thee fair and thought thee brightwho art as black as hell as dark as nightO me what eyes hath love put in my headwhich have no correspondence with true sightor if they have where is my judgment fledthat censures falsely what they see arightif that be fair whereon my false eyes dotewhat means the world to say it is not soif it be not then love doth well denoteloves eye is not so true as all mens nohow can it O how can loves eye be truethat is so vexed with watching and with tearsno marvel then though I mistake my viewthe sun itself sees not till heaven clearsO cunning love with tears thou keepest me blindlest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should findcanst thou O cruel say I love thee notwhen I against myself with thee partakedo I not think on thee when I forgotam of my self all tyrant for thy sakewho hateth thee that I do call my friendon whom frownest thou that I do fawn uponnay if thou lourest on me do I not spendrevenge upon myself with present moanwhat merit do I in my self respectthat is so proud thy service to despisewhen all my best doth worship thy defectcommanded by the motion of thine eyesbut love hate on for now I know thy mindthose that can see thou lovest and I am blindO from what power hast thou this powerful mightwith insuffiency my heart to swayto make me give the lie to my true sightand swear that brightness doth not grace the daywhence hast thou this becoming of things illthat in the very refuse of thy deedsthere is such strength and warrantise of skillthat in my mind thy worst all best exceedswho taught thee how to make me love thee morethe more I hear and see just cause of hateO though I love what others do abhorwith others thou shouldst not abhor my stateif thy unworthiness raised love in memore worthy I to be beloved of theelove is too young to know what consence isyet who knows not consence is born of lovethen gentle cheater urge not my amisslest guilty of my faults thy sweet self provefor thou betraying me I do betraymy nobler part to my gross bodys treasonmy soul doth tell my body that he maytriumph in love flesh stays no farther reasonbut rising at thy name doth point out theeas his triumphant prize proud of this pridehe is contented thy poor drudge to beto stand in thy affairs fall by thy sideno want of consence hold it that I callher love for whose dear love I rise and fallin loving thee thou knowest I am forswornbut thou art twice forsworn to me love swearingin act thy bed-vow broke and new faith tornin vowing new hate after new love bearingbut why of two oaths breach do I accuse theewhen I break twenty I am perjured mostfor all my vows are oaths but to misuse theeand all my honest faith in thee is lostfor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindnessoaths of thy love thy truth thy constancyand to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindnessor made them swear against the thing they seefor I have sworn thee fair more perjured Ito swear against the truth so foul a liecupid laid by his brand and fell asleepa maid of Dians this advantage foundand his love-kindling fire did quickly steepin a cold valley-fountain of that groundwhich borrowed from this holy fire of lovea dateless lively heat still to endureand grew a seeting bath which yet men proveagainst strange maladies a sovereign curebut at my mistress eye loves brand new-firedthe boy for trial needs would touch my breastI sick withal the help of bath desiredand thither hided a sad distempered guestbut found no cure the bath for my help lieswhere Cupid got new fire my mistress eyesthe little love-god lying once asleeplaid by his side his heart-inflaming brandwhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keepcame tripping by but in her maiden handthe fairest votary took up that firewhich many legions of true hearts had warmedand so the general of hot desirewas sleeping by a virgin hand disarmedthis brand she quenched in a cool well bywhich from loves fire took heat perpetualgrowing a bath and healthful remedyfor men diseased but I my mistress thrallcame there for cure and this by that I proveloves fire heats water water cools not love
